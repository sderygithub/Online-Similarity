Dysregulation of brain serotonin contributes to many psychiatric disorders. Tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph2), rather than Tph1, is preferentially expressed in the brain. We report a functional (C1473G) single-nucleotide polymorphism in mouse Tph2 that results in the substitution of Pro447 with Arg447 and leads to decreased serotonin levels in PC12 cells. Moreover, in BALB/cJ and DBA/2 mice that are homozygous for the 1473G allele, brain serotonin tissue content and synthesis are reduced in comparison to C57Bl/6 and 129X1/SvJ mice that are homozygous for the 1473C allele. Our data provide direct evidence for a fundamental role of Tph2 in brain serotonin synthesis.
Aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome number, has been recognized as a hallmark of human cancer for nearly a century; however, the mechanisms responsible for this abnormality have remained elusive. Here we report the identification of mutations in hCDC4 (also known as Fbw7 or Archipelago) in both human colorectal cancers and their precursor lesions. We show that genetic inactivation of hCDC4, by means of targeted disruption of the gene in karyotypically stable colorectal cancer cells, results in a striking phenotype associated with micronuclei and chromosomal instability. This phenotype can be traced to a defect in the execution of metaphase and subsequent transmission of chromosomes, and is dependent on cyclin E--a protein that is regulated by hCDC4 (refs 2-4). Our data suggest that chromosomal instability is caused by specific genetic alterations in a large fraction of human cancers and can occur before malignant conversion.
One reason for the poor immunogenicity of many tumors may be that they cannot provide signals for CD28-mediated costimulation necessary to fully activate T cells. It has recently become apparent that CTLA-4, a second counterreceptor for the B7 family of costimulatory molecules, is a negative regulator of T cell activation. Here, in vivo administration of antibodies to CTLA-4 resulted in the rejection of tumors, including preestablished tumors. Furthermore, this rejection resulted in immunity to a secondary exposure to tumor cells. These results suggest that blockade of the inhibitory effects of CTLA-4 can allow for, and potentiate, effective immune responses against tumor cells.
The mechanisms that establish and sharpen pattern across epithelia are poorly understood. In the developing nervous system, the first pattern elements appear as 'proneural clusters' In the morphogenetic furrow of the immature Drosophila retina proneural clusters emerge in a wave as a patterned array of 6-10-cell groups, which are recognizable by expression of Atonal, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is required to establish and pattern the first cell fate. The establishment and subsequent patterning of Atonal expression requires activity of the signalling transmembrane receptor Notch. Here we present in vivo and biochemical evidence that the secreted protein Scabrous associates with Notch, and can stabilize Notch protein at the surface. The result is a regulation of Notch activity that sharpens proneural cluster boundaries and ensures establishment of single pioneer neurons.
During development of the nervous system, neurons in many regions are overproduced by proliferation, after which the excess cells are eliminated by cell death. The survival of only a proportion of neurons during normal development is thought to be regulated by the limited availability of neurotrophic agents. One such putative trophic agent is ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a polypeptide that promotes the survival of ciliary, sensory, and sympathetic neurons in vitro. In contrast to the results of in vitro studies, however, the daily treatment of chick embryos in vivo with purified human recombinant CNTF failed to rescue any of these cell populations from cell death, whereas CNTF did promote the in vivo survival of spinal motoneurons. Thus, CNTF may not act as a neurotrophic agent in vivo for those embryonic neurons (especially ciliary neurons) on which it acts in vitro. Rather, CNTF may be required for in vivo survival of motoneurons.
Antibodies to substance P with a high titer have been produced and used in immunohistochemical studies on the peripheral and central nervous system of the rat and the cat. Evidence was obtained for the localization of substance P in a certain population of primary sensory neurons, probably small nerve cells with unmyelinated processes. Substance P or a peptide similar to it was also observed in cell bodies in the medial habenula and in probable nerve terminals in many brain areas. The results give morphological support for a transmitter (or modulator) role of substance P in the nervous system.
In humans temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by recurrent seizures, neuronal hyperexcitability, and selective loss of certain neuronal populations in the hippocampus. Animal models of the condition indicate that a diminution of inhibition mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) accounts for the altered function, and it has been hypothesized that the diminution arises because GABAergic basket interneurons are "dormant" as a result of their being disconnected from excitatory inputs. In hippocampal slices, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were elicited in CA1 pyramidal cells by activation of basket cells; responses from an animal model of TLE were compared to those from control tissue. IPSPs evoked indirectly by activation of terminals that then excited basket cells were reduced in the epileptic tissue, whereas IPSPs evoked by direct activation of basket cells, when excitatory neurotransmission was blocked, were not different from controls. These results provide support for the "dormant basket cell" hypothesis and have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of human TLE.
In the mollusk Aplysia the neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT) has a fundamental modulatory role in several forms of learning and memory that involve an increase in the efficacy of synaptic transmission between tail sensory neurons (SNs) and motor neurons. The classical 5HT antagonist cyproheptadine (CYP) permits dissociation of three forms of serotonergic modulation in these SNs: (i) CYP reversibly blocks spike-broadening induced either by exogenous application of 5HT or by sensitizing stimulation of a tail nerve. (ii) CYP does not block 5HT-induced or tail input-induced increases in SN somatic excitability. (iii) Concomitant with its block of spike-broadening, CYP reversibly blocks 5HT-induced facilitation of synaptic transmission from SNs. These results suggest that endogenously released 5HT may act at different receptor subtypes that are coupled to different forms of neuromodulation in tail SNs of Aplysia.
In a recent study, it was concluded that natural time-varying stimuli are represented more reliably in the brain than constant stimuli are. The results presented here disagree with this conclusion, although they were obtained from the same identified neuron (H1) in the fly's visual system. For large parts of the neuron's activity range, the variability of the responses was very similar for constant and time-varying stimuli and was considerably smaller than that in many visual interneurons of vertebrates.
Deriving the quantity of items is an abstract form of categorization. To explore it, monkeys were trained to judge whether successive visual displays contained the same quantity of items. Many neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex were tuned for quantity irrespective of the exact physical appearance of the displays. Their tuning curves formed overlapping filters, which may explain why behavioral discrimination improves with increasing numerical distance and why discrimination of two quantities with equal numerical distance worsens as their numerical size increases. A mechanism that extracts the quantity of visual field items could contribute to general numerical ability.
Echolocating bats determine distance to targets by the time delay between their emitted biosonar pulses and the returning echoes. By varying the delay between synthetic pulses and echoes in stimulus pairs at various repetition rates and durations, neurons have been found in the auditory cortex of the mustache bat (Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus) which are sensitive to target range during the search, approach, and terminal phases of prey capture or landing. Two classes of range-sensitive neurons were found: (i) tracking neurons, whose best delay for response to an echo following the emitted pulse becomes shorter and narrower as the bat closes in on the target, and (ii) range-tuned neurons, whose best delay is constant, and which respond to the target only when it is within a certain narrow fixed range. Range-tuned neurons are specialized for processing echoes only during a particular period of the search, approach, or terminal phases of echolocation, and they provide support for a theory of ranging in bats that incorporates groups of neurons with a spectrum of preferred echo delays to detect target distance.
The biochemical machinery that underlies circadian rhythms is conserved among animal species and drives self-sustained molecular oscillations and functions, even within individual asynchronous tissue-culture cells. Yet the rhythm-generating neural centres of higher eukaryotes are usually composed of interconnected cellular networks, which contribute to robustness and synchrony as well as other complex features of rhythmic behaviour. In mammals, little is known about how individual brain oscillators are organized to orchestrate a complex behavioural pattern. Drosophila is arguably more advanced from this point of view: we and others have recently shown that a group of adult brain clock neurons expresses the neuropeptide PDF and controls morning activity (small LN(v) cells; M-cells), whereas another group of clock neurons controls evening activity (CRY+, PDF- cells; E-cells). We have generated transgenic mosaic animals with different circadian periods in morning and evening cells. Here we show, by behavioural and molecular assays, that the six canonical groups of clock neurons are organized into two separate neuronal circuits. One has no apparent effect on locomotor rhythmicity in darkness, but within the second circuit the molecular and behavioural timing of the evening cells is determined by morning-cell properties. This is due to a daily resetting signal from the morning to the evening cells, which run at their genetically programmed pace between consecutive signals. This neural circuit and oscillator-coupling mechanism ensures a proper relationship between the timing of morning and evening locomotor activity.
Clostridial neurotoxins, including tetanus toxin and the seven serotypes of botulinum toxin (A-G), are produced as single chains and cleaved to generate toxins with two chains joined by a single disulphide bond (Fig. 1). The heavy chain (M(r) 100,000 (100K)) is responsible for specific binding to neuronal cells and cell penetration of the light chain (50K), which blocks neurotransmitter release. Several lines of evidence have recently suggested that clostridial neurotoxins could be zinc endopeptidases. Here we show that tetanus and botulinum toxins serotype B are zinc endopeptidases, the activation of which requires reduction of the interchain disulphide bond. The protease activity is localized on the light chain and is specific for synaptobrevin, an integral membrane protein of small synaptic vesicles. The rat synaptobrevin-2 isoform is cleaved by both neurotoxins at the same single site, the peptide bond Gln 76-Phe 77, but the isoform synaptobrevin-1, which has a valine at the corresponding position, is not cleaved. The blocking of neurotransmitter release of Aplysia neurons injected with tetanus toxin or botulinum toxins serotype B is substantially delayed by peptides containing the synaptobrevin-2 cleavage site. These results indicate that tetanus and botulinum B neurotoxins block neurotransmitter release by cleaving synaptobrevin-2, a protein that, on the basis of our results, seems to play a key part in neurotransmitter release.
The distribution of cyclic 3',5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity in rat cerebral cortex was determined by cytochemical methods. The detectable phosphodiesterase activity was localized in postsynaptic (dendritic) nerve endings, most of it immediately adjacent to the synaptic membrane. Most of the postsynaptic nerve endings showed phosphodiesterase activity.
Choosing an action that leads to a desired goal requires an understanding of the linkages between actions and their outcomes. We investigated neural mechanisms of such goal-based action selection. We trained monkeys on a task in which the relation between visual cues, action types, and reward conditions changed regularly, such that the monkeys selected their actions based on anticipated reward conditions. A significant number of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex were activated, after cue presentation and before motor execution, only by particular action-reward combinations. This prefrontal activity is likely to underlie goal-based action selection.
In learning a black-white discrimination response, the efficiency of rhesus monkeys with lesions of the anterior frontal cortex varies inversely with the spatial separation of the discriminative stimuli from the places of response and reward. Though there is a similar relationship in intact animals, impairment of learning due to discontiguity is greater in the animals with brain lesions.
The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor acts as an InsP3-gated Ca2+ release channel in a variety of cell types. Type 1 InsP3 receptor (IP3R1) is the major neuronal member of the IP3R family in the central nervous system, predominantly enriched in cerebellar Purkinje cells but also concentrated in neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region, caudate-putamen, and cerebral cortex. Here we report that most IP3R1-deficient mice generated by gene targeting die in utero, and born animals have severe ataxia and tonic or tonic-clonic seizures and die by the weaning period. An electroencephalogram showed that they suffer from epilepsy, indicating that IP3R1 is essential for proper brain function. However, observation by light microscope of the haematoxylin-eosin staining of the brain and peripheral tissues of IP3R1-deficient mice showed no abnormality, and the unique electrophysiological properties of the cerebellar Purkinje cells of IP3R1-deficient mice were not severely impaired.
Neurosecretory brain cells from late nymphal and adult cockroaches were grown for 1 to 3 months in a chemically defined medium in combined cultures with embryonic organs or oocytes from nymphal and adult specimens. Under these conditions, neurosecretory cells show vigorous axonal growth. Electron dense granules in cell perikarya and axons of 3-month-old cultures are suggestive of neurosecretory activity in vitro.
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a principal Ser/Thr phosphatase, the deregulation of which is associated with multiple human cancers, Alzheimer's disease and increased susceptibility to pathogen infections. How PP2A is structurally organized and functionally regulated remains unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of an AB'C heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzyme. The structure reveals that the HEAT repeats of the scaffold A subunit form a horseshoe-shaped fold, holding the catalytic C and regulatory B' subunits together on the same side. The regulatory B' subunit forms pseudo-HEAT repeats and interacts with the C subunit near the active site, thereby defining substrate specificity. The methylated carboxy-terminal tail of the C subunit interacts with a highly negatively charged region at the interface between A and B' subunits, suggesting that the C-terminal carboxyl methylation of the C subunit promotes B' subunit recruitment by neutralizing charge repulsion. Together, our structural results establish a crucial foundation for understanding PP2A assembly, substrate recruitment and regulation.
Bursts of impulses in groups of brain cells of the nudibranch Tritonia trigger prolonged swimming that is identical to the natural escape response. The cells in which the activity occurs form two bilaterally symmetrical groups of at least 30 cells in each pleural ganglion. These neurons are interconnected by pathways that have a low electrical resistance, both within a ganglion and across the brain. Together they form a network that determinies whether a swimming escape response will occur or not by filtering out weak neural activity yet responding with a burst of impulses to intensive specific input to either group.
The construction of the brain during embryonic development was thought to be largely independent of its electrical activity. In this view, proliferation, migration and differentiation of neurons are driven entirely by genetic programs and activity is important only at later stages in refinement of connections. However, recent findings demonstrate that activity plays essential roles in early development of the nervous system. Activity has similar roles in the incorporation of newly born neurons in the adult nervous system, suggesting that there are general rules underlying activity-dependent development. The extensive involvement of activity makes it likely that it is required at all developmental stages as a necessary partner with genetic programs.
In legumes, root nodule organogenesis is activated in response to morphogenic lipochitin oligosaccharides that are synthesized by bacteria, commonly known as rhizobia. Successful symbiotic interaction results in the formation of highly specialized organs called root nodules, which provide a unique environment for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. In wild-type plants the number of nodules is regulated by a signalling mechanism integrating environmental and developmental cues to arrest most rhizobial infections within the susceptible zone of the root. Furthermore, a feedback mechanism controls the temporal and spatial susceptibility to infection of the root system. This mechanism is referred to as autoregulation of nodulation, as earlier nodulation events inhibit nodulation of younger root tissues. Lotus japonicus plants homozygous for a mutation in the hypernodulation aberrant root (har1) locus escape this regulation and form an excessive number of nodules. Here we report the molecular cloning and expression analysis of the HAR1 gene and the pea orthologue, Pisum sativum, SYM29. HAR1 encodes a putative serine/threonine receptor kinase, which is required for shoot-controlled regulation of root growth, nodule number, and for nitrate sensitivity of symbiotic development.
Glycine increases Cl- conductance in neurones of the lamprey central nervous system and mimics the natural inhibitory transmitter pharmacologically. We have use current noise produce by glycine to examine in more detail the characteristics of inhibitory channels in Muller cells in the brain stem reticular formation. The channels have large conductances and mean open times consistent with large amplitudes and long durations of spontaneously occurring inhibitory synaptic currents. We now show that, unlike any post-junctional channels reported so far, their conductance decreases rapidly with increasing intracellular concentration of the permeant ion. This surprising behaviour is inconsistent with constant field theory and also with a single-site pore model such as proposed for cationic channels at the motor endplate, both of which predict an increase in conductance with concentration. In addition, the decrease in conductance cannot be explained quantitatively by a two-site, single-file pore model such as proposed for K+ channels and Na+ channels in nerve and for gramicidin channels. This property of the inhibitory channel may be functionally important in preventing intracellular Cl- accumulation during periods of intense synaptic activity when inhibition might otherwise convert progressively to excitation as the Cl- equilibrium potential became more and more positive.
Polysialic acid (PSA) is a dynamically regulated product of post-translational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule, NCAM. Presence of the large anionic carbohydrate modulates NCAM binding properties and, by increasing the intercellular space, influences interactions between other cell surface molecules. PSA expression underlies cell type- and developmental-specific alterations and correlates with stages of cellular motility. In the adult, PSA becomes restricted to regions of permanent neural plasticity and regenerating neural and muscle tissues. Recent data implicate its important function in spatial learning and memory, and in tumour biology. Here we describe the molecular characterization of polysialyltransferase-1, the key enzyme of eukaryotic PSA synthesis. In reconstitution experiments, the newly cloned enzyme induces PSA synthesis in all NCAM-expressing cell lines. Our data therefore represent convincing evidence that the polycondensation of alpha-2,8-linked sialic acids in mammals is the result of a single enzymatic activity and provide a new basis for studying the functional role of PSA in neuro- and tumour biology.
Hepatic porphyrias are disorders of heme synthesis characterized by genetically determined lesions of one of the key enzymes of heme synthesis. In carriers of such lesions, several factors (drugs, environmental chemicals, or diet) precipitate acute and often fatal attacks of neurologic dysfunction, which are promptly relieved by intravenous infusion of heme. However, the mechanism of such heme-induced amelioration remains elusive. To probe this mechanism, the biochemical events triggered by acute hepatic heme deficiency were examined in an animal model of chemically induced porphyria. Acute hepatic heme depletion in porphyric rats was found to impair hepatic tryptophan pyrrolase activity which, in turn, elevated tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover in the brain. These alterations in porphyric rats were dramatically reversed by parenteral heme administration. These findings suggest that increased tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the nervous system may be responsible for the neurologic dysfunctions observed in humans with acute attacks of hepatic porphyria.
Two types of histamine receptor, the H1- and H2-receptors, are found not only on vascular smooth muscle cells but on the perivascular autonomic nerve terminals. Activation of the prejunctional histamine receptors modifies transmitter release from the nerve terminals. Recently, histamine was shown to inhibit its own release from depolarized slices of rat cerebral cortex. This phenomenon was found to be mediated by a novel class of histamine receptor, the H3-receptor, that was pharmacologically distinct from the H1- and H2-receptors. Up to now, there has been no indication whether this third class of histamine receptor is present in any tissue other than the brain. We report here that histamine depresses sympathetic neurotransmission in the guinea-pig mesenteric artery by interacting with histamine H3-receptors on the perivascular nerve terminals. The pharmacological properties of these receptors are similar to those reported for the H3-receptors in the brain. Our data provide evidence for the existence of H3-receptors in the autonomic nervous system.
ADP-ribosylation of regulatory proteins is an important pathological mechanism by which various bacterial toxins affect eukaryotic cell functions. While diphtheria toxin catalyses the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2, which results in inhibition of protein synthesis, cholera toxin and pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylate Ns and Ni, respectively, the GTP-binding regulatory components of the adenylate cyclase system, thereby modulating the bidirectional hormonal regulation of the adenylate cyclase. Botulinum C2 toxin is another toxin which has been reported to possess ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. This extremely toxic agent is produced by certain strains of Clostridium botulinum and induces hypotension, an increase in intestinal secretion, vascular permeability and haemorrhaging in the lungs. In contrast to botulinum neurotoxins, the botulinum C2 toxin apparently lacks any neurotoxic effects. Here we report that botulinum C2 toxin ADP-ribosylates a protein of relative molecular mass 43,000 (43K) in intact cells and in cell-free preparations. We present evidence that the 43K protein substrate is actin, which is apparently mono-ADP-ribosylated by the toxin. Botulinum C2 toxin also ADP-ribosylated purified liver G-actin, whereas liver F-actin was only poorly ADP-ribosylated and skeletal muscle actin was not ADP-ribosylated in either its G form or its F form. ADP-ribosylation of liver G-actin by botulinum C2 toxin resulted in a drastic reduction in viscosity of actin polymerized in vitro.
Stimulation of the caudate nucleus modifies inputs to the visual system of the cat. The modification of such sensory information is similar to the modification seen on stimulation of the thalamus and brain stem reticular formation. Preliminary stimulation of the caudate nucleus at different intervals prior to the afferent input may have facilitatory or inhibitory effects on both evoked potentials and unitary responses of the visual cortex.
Haemoglobins and myoglobins constitute related protein families that function in oxygen transport and storage in humans and other vertebrates. Here we report the identification of a third globin type in man and mouse. This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, and therefore we have called it neuroglobin. Mouse neuroglobin is a monomer with a high oxygen affinity (half saturation pressure, P50 approximately 2 torr). Analogous to myoglobin, neuroglobin may increase the availability of oxygen to brain tissue. The human neuroglobin gene (NGB), located on chromosome 14q24, has a unique exon-intron structure. Neuroglobin represents a distinct protein family that diverged early in metazoan evolution, probably before the Protostomia/Deuterostomia split.
Acidic amino acids, such as l-glutamate, are believed to be excitatory neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain and exert effects on several different receptors named after the selective agonists kainate, quisqualate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The first two receptors collectively termed non-NMDA receptors, have been implicated in the mediation of synaptic transmission in many excitatory pathways in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas NMDA receptors, with few exceptions do not appear to be involved; this is typified in the hippocampus where there is a high density of NMDA receptors yet selective NMDA receptor antagonists, such as D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV), do not affect synaptic potentials. NMDA receptors have, however, been shown to be involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, a form of synaptic plasticity which may be involved in learning and memory. NMDA receptors have also been found to contribute to epileptiform activity in this region. We now describe how NMDA receptors can participate during high-frequency synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, their involvement during low-frequency transmission being greatly suppressed by Mg2+. A frequency dependent alleviation of this blockade provides a novel synaptic mechanism whereby a single neurotransmitter can transmit very different information depending on the temporal nature of the input. This mechanism could account for the involvement of NMDA receptors in the initiation of LPT and their contribution, in part, to epileptic activity.
Current ideas about the dependence of neurons on target-derived growth factors were formulated on the basis of experiments involving neurons with projections to the periphery. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and recently identified members of the NGF family of neuronal growth factors, known as neurotrophins, are thought to regulate survival of sympathetic and certain populations of sensory ganglion cells during development. Far less is known about factors that regulate the survival of spinal and cranial motor neurons, which also project to peripheral targets. NGF has not been shown to influence motor neuron survival, and whether the newly identified neurotrophins promote motor neuron survival is unknown. We show here that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is retrogradely transported by motor neurons in neonatal rats and that local application of BDNF to transected sciatic nerve prevents the massive death of motor neurons that normally follows axotomy in the neonatal period. These results show that BDNF has survival-promoting effects on motor neurons in vivo and suggest that BDNF may influence motor neuron survival during development.
Bovine brain-derived acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) is a protein mitogen originally identified in partially purified preparations of whole brain. The protein was purified to homogeneity and shown to be a potent vascular endothelial cell mitogen in culture and angiogenic substance in vivo. The homology of aFGF to human interleukin-1 beta was inferred from partial sequence data. The complete amino acid sequence of aFGF has now been determined and observed to be similar to both basic FGF and interleukin-1's. A neuropeptide-like sequence, flanked by basic dipeptides, was observed within the aFGF sequence.
The liver-expressed microRNA-122 (miR-122) is essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA accumulation in cultured liver cells, but its potential as a target for antiviral intervention has not been assessed. We found that treatment of chronically infected chimpanzees with a locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotide (SPC3649) complementary to miR-122 leads to long-lasting suppression of HCV viremia, with no evidence of viral resistance or side effects in the treated animals. Furthermore, transcriptome and histological analyses of liver biopsies demonstrated derepression of target mRNAs with miR-122 seed sites, down-regulation of interferon-regulated genes, and improvement of HCV-induced liver pathology. The prolonged virological response to SPC3649 treatment without HCV rebound holds promise of a new antiviral therapy with a high barrier to resistance.
Transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3), restricted in its expression to a specialized regulatory CD4+ T-cell subset (T(R)) with a dedicated suppressor function, controls T(R) lineage development. In humans and mice, Foxp3 deficiency results in a paucity of T(R) cells and a fatal breach in immunological tolerance, causing highly aggressive multi-organ autoimmune pathology. Here, through genome-wide analysis combining chromatin immunoprecipitation with mouse genome tiling array profiling, we identify Foxp3 binding regions for approximately 700 genes and for an intergenically encoded microRNA. We find that a large number of Foxp3-bound genes are up- or downregulated in Foxp3+ T cells, suggesting that Foxp3 acts as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. Foxp3-mediated regulation unique to the thymus affects, among others, genes encoding nuclear factors that control gene expression and chromatin remodelling. In contrast, Foxp3 target genes shared by the thymic and peripheral T(R) cells encode primarily plasma membrane proteins, as well as cell signalling proteins. Together, our studies suggest that distinct transcriptional sub-programmes implemented by Foxp3 establish T(R) lineage during differentiation and its proliferative and functional competence in the periphery.
Intracellular recordings were made from locus coeruleus neurons in a brain slice preparation. Opiates and opioid peptides produced a dose-dependent, stereospecific, naloxone-reversible hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane. This was associated with an increase in membrane conductance.
Immune complexes are potent activators of inflammatory cells, triggering effector responses through the crosslinking of Fc receptors (FcRs) such as Fc(epsilon)RI or Fc(gamma)RIII. On B cells and mast cells, immune complexes are also negative regulators of activation triggered by antigen and Fc receptors, a consequence of coligation of the B-cell antigen receptor or Fc(epsilon)RI, respectively, and the inhibitory receptor Fc(gamma)RIIB. Here we show that inhibitory signalling by Fc(gamma)RIIB does not require the SH2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1, in mast cells and results in the recruitment of the SH2-domain-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, SHIP, to the tyrosine-phosphorylated 13-amino-acid inhibitory motif of Fc(gamma)RIIB in both B cells and mast cells. SHIP, by hydrolysing the 5-phosphate of phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)P3 and inositol(1,3,4,5)P4, suggests a mechanism by which Fc(gamma)RIIB can inhibit calcium influx and downstream responses triggered by immune receptors.
Transforming growth factor-beta TGF-beta is the prototype for a family of extracellular proteins that affect cell proliferation and tissue differentiation. TGF-beta-related factors, including BMP-2/4, Dpp and activin, act through two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors which can form a heteromeric complex. However, the mechanism of signal transduction by these receptors is largely unknown. In Drosophila, Mad is required for signalling by Dpp. We have isolated complementary DNAs for four human Mad homologues, one of which, hMAD-4, is identical to DPC-4, a candidate tumour suppressor. hMAD-3 and -4 synergized to induce strong ligand-independent TGF-beta-like responses. When truncated at their carboxy termini, hMAD-3 and -4 act as dominant-negative inhibitors of the normal TGF-beta response. The activity of hMAD-3 and -4 was regulated by the TGF-beta receptors, and hMAD-3 but not hMAD-4 was phosphorylated and associated with the ligand-bound receptor complex. These results define hMAD-3 and -4 as effectors of the TGF-beta response and demonstrate a function for DPCA-4/hMAD-4 as a tumour suppressor.
Buschman and Miller (Reports, 30 March 2007, p. 1860) described the activity of ensembles of neurons in parietal and frontal cortex of monkeys performing visual search for targets that were easy or hard to distinguish from distractors. However, their conclusions are called into question by discrepancies between their results and publications from other laboratories measuring the same neural process.
In lymphocytes, the expression of early immune response genes is regulated by NF-AT transcription factors which translocate to the nucleus after dephosphorylation by the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. We report here that mice bearing a disruption in the NF-ATc gene fail to develop normal cardiac valves and septa and die of circulatory failure before day 14.5 of development. NF-ATc is first expressed in the heart at day 7.5, and is restricted to the endocardium, a specialized endothelium that gives rise to the valves and septum. Within the endocardium, specific inductive events appear to activate NF-ATc: it is localized to the nucleus only in endocardial cells that are adjacent to the interface with the cardiac jelly and myocardium, which are thought to give the inductive stimulus to the valve primordia. Treatment of wild-type embryos with FK506, a specific calcineurin inhibitor, prevents nuclear localization of NF-ATc. These data indicate that the Ca2+/calcineurin/NF-ATc signalling pathway is essential for normal cardiac valve and septum morphogenesis; hence, NF-ATc and its regulatory pathways are candidates for genetic defects underlying congenital human heart disease.
Glutamatergic abnormalities have been associated with several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and addiction. Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors were targeted to normalize glutamatergic disruptions associated with an animal model of schizophrenia, the phencyclidine model. An agonist of this group of receptors, at a dose that was without effects on spontaneous activity and corticolimbic dopamine neurotransmission, attenuated the disruptive effects of phencyclidine on working memory, stereotypy, locomotion, and cortical glutamate efflux. This behavioral reversal occurred in spite of sustained dopamine hyperactivity. Thus, targeting this group of receptors may present a nondopaminergic therapeutic strategy for treatment of psychiatric disorders.
Electrical stimulation of multiple peripheral nerves, elicited "H" reflexes in a patient, 61 years old, with botulism. These reflexes are extremely suggestive of some central release or failure of inhibitory control of a monosynaptic or polysynaptic spinal reflex arc. This "central" action of botulinus toxin is similar to that suggested for tetanus toxin.
Analgesia results when opiates are microinjected into the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). This region, which includes the nucleus raphe magnus and the adjacent reticular formation, is rich in immunoreactive enkephalin-containing neurones and terminals, and contains neurones that project to the spinal cord dorsal horn where they inhibit identified nociceptive spinothalamic tract neurones. Although opiates have previously been reported either to excite or inhibit RVM cells, the possibility of an opiate effect being consistent within a physiologically defined subclass has not been examined. Recently we described a class of neurone in the RVM (the off-cell) that abruptly pauses just before a heat-evoked tail-flick reflex. If off-cells are made to fire continuously by direct electrical stimulation of the RVM, the tail-flick reflex does not occur. We report here that analgesic doses of morphine completely eliminate the pause in firing that precedes the tail-flick reflex. We propose that this disinhibition of off-cells in the RVM is a primary process contributing to opiate inhibition of nociceptor-induced reflexes.
alpha2-Adrenergic receptors (alpha2ARs) present in the brainstem decrease blood pressure and are targets for clinically effective antihypertensive drugs. The existence of three alpha2AR subtypes, the lack of subtype-specific ligands, and the cross-reactivity of alpha2AR agonists with imidazoline receptors has precluded an understanding of the role of individual alpha2AR subtypes in the hypotensive response. Gene targeting was used to introduce a point mutation into the alpha2aAR subtype in the mouse genome. The hypotensive response to alpha2AR agonists was lost in the mutant mice, demonstrating that the alpha2aAR subtype plays a principal role in this response.
The substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease (PD) is depleted of dopaminergic neurons and contains fibrillar Lewy bodies comprising primarily alpha-synuclein. We screened a library to identify drug-like molecules to probe the relation between neurodegeneration and alpha-synuclein fibrilization. All but one of 15 fibril inhibitors were catecholamines related to dopamine. The inhibitory activity of dopamine depended on its oxidative ligation to alpha-synuclein and was selective for the protofibril-to-fibril conversion, causing accumulation of the alpha-synuclein protofibril. Adduct formation provides an explanation for the dopaminergic selectivity of alpha-synuclein-associated neurotoxicity in PD and has implications for current and future PD therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.
The CD19-CR2 complex of B lymphocytes contains proteins that participate in two host-defense systems, the immune and complement systems. The ligand for the subunit of the immune system, CD19, is not known, but the complement receptor subunit, CR2 (CD21), binds activation fragments of the C3 component of the complement system and may mediate immunopotentiating effects of complement. A recombinant, soluble CR2 was prepared by fusing the C3-binding region of the receptor to immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). The (CR2)2-IgG1 chimera competed with cellular CR2 for C3 binding and suppressed the antibody response to a T cell-dependent antigen when administered to mice at the time of immunization. This inhibitory effect of (CR2)2-IgG1 demonstrates the B cell-activating function of the CD19-CR2 complex and suggests a new method for humoral immunosuppression.
Neurotrophic factors support the differentiation and survival of neurons and influence properties of synaptic transmission. The neurotrophic hypothesis postulates a retrograde action of trophic factors: their production and release by target cells and their uptake by innervating axons. Besides the retrograde route of trophic messengers, the survival of neurons and the development of synapses is thought to be also regulated by anterograde, afferent trophic signals. We now show that exogenous neurotrophins are transported in the anterograde direction, from cell bodies to the axon terminals, and that the intact neurotrophin is released after anterograde transport, taken up and utilized by second-order visual neurons in the developing chick brain. These results suggest that anterogradely transported neurotrophins may play a role in synaptic plasticity and may have effects at more than one synapse beyond the initial release site.
Vesicular secretion of neurotransmitter is essential for neuronal communication. Kiss-and-run is a mode of membrane fusion and retrieval without the full collapse of the vesicle into the plasma membrane and de novo regeneration. The importance of kiss-and-run during efficient neurotransmission has remained in doubt. We developed an approach for loading individual synaptic vesicles with single quantum dots. Their size and pH-dependent photoluminescence change allowed us to distinguish kiss-and-run from full-collapse fusion and to track single vesicles through multiple rounds of kiss-and-run and reuse, without perturbing vesicle cycling. Kiss-and-run dominated at the beginning of stimulus trains, reflecting the preference of vesicles with high release probability. Its incidence was increased by rapid firing, a response appropriate to shape the kinetics of neurotransmission during a wide range of firing patterns.
Baclofen has been used as an antispastic agent for over a decade, yet its mechanism of action is still not fully understood. While early iontophoretic studies revealed a depression of neuronal activity, more recent studies have emphasized a presynaptic depression of transmitter release, both in the peripheral and central nervous system, possibly resulting from a blockade of calcium channels. Although baclofen is structurally similar to the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), none of its actions seem to be antagonized by the GABA antagonist, bicuculline. However, recent experiments have indicated that baclofen binds to a class of bicuculline-resistant GABA receptors, termed GABAB receptors. Here, we have analysed the action of baclofen on the membrane potential of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells in vitro and report that it directly hyperpolarizes these cells in a potent, stereoselective manner which is resistant to bicuculline methiodide. This response is associated with a decrease in neuronal input resistance and may involve an increase in potassium conductance.
Autoradiographic representation of the local rates of cerebral glucose utilization and local cerebral functional activity by means of the [14C]deoxyglucose technique reveals the existence of the ocular dominance columns in the striate cortex of the monkey in the first day of life. In contrast to the stability of these columns in more mature brain, monocular deprivation for 3 months from the first day of life results in their complete disappearance and a reversion of the autoradiographic pattern to that seen in animals with normal binocular vision. These results are consistent with a reorganization of the representation of the visual fields of the two eyes in the striate cortex and provide additional evidence of the plasticity of the striate cortex of the monkey in early life.
Long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampus is a type of synaptic plasticity that is thought to be involved in learning and memory. Several lines of evidence suggest that LTP involves 3',5'-cyclic GMP (cGMP), perhaps as an activity-dependent presynaptic effector of one or more retrograde messengers (refs 2-12, but see ref. 13). However, previous results are also consistent with postsynaptic effects of cGMP. This is difficult to test in hippocampal slices, but more rigorous tests are possible in dissociated cell culture. We have therefore developed a reliable method for producing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent LTP at synapses between individual hippocampal pyramidal neurons in culture. We report that inhibitors of guanylyl cyclase or of cGMP-dependent protein kinase block potentiation by either tetanic stimulation or low-frequency stimulation paired with postsynaptic depolarization. Conversely, application of 8-Br-cGMP to the bath or injection of cGMP into the presynaptic neuron produces activity-dependent long-lasting potentiation. The potentiation by cGMP involves an increase in transmitter release that is in part independent of changes in the presynaptic action potential. These results support a presynaptic role for cGMP in LTP.
Selected actions of neurotransmitters and hormones on ion channels in nerve and muscle cells are now thought to be mediated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein phosphorylation. Although the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) affects the cellular properties of several neurones, its mode of action at the single-channel level has not been characterized. In addition, little is known about the identity or subcellular localization of the phosphoproteins that control channel activity and, in particular, whether the critical substrate proteins are cytoplasmic or membrane-associated. In Aplysia sensory neurones, serotonin produces a slow modulatory synaptic potential mediated by cAMP-PK that contributes to presynaptic facilitation and behavioural sensitization. Previously, we have found that serotonin acts on cell-attached membrane patches to produce prolonged all-or-none closures of a specific class of K+ channels (S channels) whose gating is weakly dependent on voltage and independent of intracellular calcium. We demonstrate here that in cell-free membrane patches from Aplysia sensory neurones, the purified catalytic subunit of cAMP-PK produces all-or-none closures of the S channel, simulating most (but not all) aspects of the action of serotonin on cell-attached patches. This result suggests that protein kinase acts on the internal surface of the membrane to phosphorylate either the channel itself or a membrane-associated protein that regulates channel activity.
To localize objects in space, the brain needs to combine information about the position of the stimulus on the retinae with information about the location of the eyes in their orbits. Interaction between these two types of information occurs in several cortical areas, but the role of the primary visual cortex (area V1) in this process has remained unclear. Here we show that, for half the cells recorded in area V1 of behaving monkeys, the classically described visual responses are strongly modulated by gaze direction. Specifically, we find that selectivity for horizontal retinal disparity-the difference in the position of a stimulus on each retina which relates to relative object distance-and for stimulus orientation may be present at a given gaze direction, but be absent or poorly expressed at another direction. Shifts in preferred disparity also occurred in several neurons. These neural changes were most often present at the beginning of the visual response, suggesting a feedforward gain control by eye position signals. Cortical neural processes for encoding information about the three-dimensional position of a stimulus in space therefore start as early as area V1.
There is increasing evidence that L-glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Immunocytochemical studies indicate that glutamate within nerve terminals may be concentrated in vesicles and glutamate-accumulating vesicles have recently been isolated. Exocytotic release of glutamate from synaptosomes (isolated nerve terminals) has not been convincingly demonstrated, however, and remains highly controversial. In order to study the kinetics of release of endogenous L-glutamate from guinea pig cerebral cortical synaptosomes we have devised a continuous enzymatic assay. This has enabled us to identify a pool, equivalent to 15-20% of the total synaptosomal glutamate, which is capable of rapid Ca2+-dependent exocytotic release.
The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) contains a remarkable array of neural cells, each with a complex pattern of connections that together generate perceptions and higher brain functions. Here we describe a large-scale screen to create an atlas of CNS gene expression at the cellular level, and to provide a library of verified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors and transgenic mouse lines that offer experimental access to CNS regions, cell classes and pathways. We illustrate the use of this atlas to derive novel insights into gene function in neural cells, and into principal steps of CNS development. The atlas, library of BAC vectors and BAC transgenic mice generated in this screen provide a rich resource that allows a broad array of investigations not previously available to the neuroscience community.
The function of neuropeptide Y, one of the most abundant peptide transmitters of the mammalian brain, remains unclear because of a lack of specific receptor antagonists. An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to the NH2-terminus of the rat Y1 receptor was constructed and added to cultures of rat cortical neurons. This treatment resulted in a reduced density of Y1 (but not Y2) receptors and diminished the decrease in adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) usually seen after Y1 receptor activation. Repeated injection of the same oligodeoxynucleotide into the lateral cerebral ventricle of rats was followed by a similar reduction of cortical Y1 (but not Y2) receptors. Such antisense-treated animals displayed behavioral signs of anxiety. Thus, specific inhibition of neurotransmitter receptor expression can be accomplished in the living brain and demonstrates that altered central neuropeptide Y transmission produces an anxiety-like state.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and dopamine were identified simultaneously in the same block of tissue from the median eminence of the rat brain. Two distinct bands of dopamine terminals were found in the lateral median eminence: an inner band which overlapped the gonadotropin-releasing hormone terminals and an outer band which appeared juxtaposed to portal capillaries.
Neurons in the buccal ganglia of Navanax inermis which control circumferential muscles of the pharynx showed typical electrotonic coupling when there was little synaptic activity in them. When there was much inhibitory activity, the effective sign of coupling was reversed; that is, hyperpolarization and depolarization of one cell caused depolarization and hyperpolarization of the others. A neural circuit explaining these results involes inhibitory neurons electronically coupled to and also inhibitory to the circumferential neurons that are themselves coupled. This circuit offers considerable flexibility for mediation of different activity patterns in this simple neuronal system.
Enkephalin, applied microiontophoretically, depressed spontaneous and glutamate-induced firing of single neurons in frontal cortex, caudate nucleus, and periaqueductal gray matter, where enkephalin and high concentrations of opiate receptors are found. Many of the depressions were blocked by the specific narcotic antagonist naloxone. The data are compatible with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role for this new brain pentapeptide.
The Caenorhabditis elegans gene unc-30 is required for the development and functioning of the 19 inhibitory GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric-acid-secreting) type D motor neurons, which control locomotion. In unc-30 mutants the D neurons lack GABA and have defects in axonal pathfinding and synaptic connections (J. White, personal communication). We report here that unc-30 encodes a homeodomain protein that is present in the nuclei of the D neurons at high levels in young larvae, in which the motor circuitry is formed, and at low levels in older animals. The UNC-30 protein is also present in six non-GABAergic neurons and is absent from the seven non-D-type GABAergic neurons. Ectopic expression of unc-30 induced GABA expression in cells that are normally not GABAergic. We propose that unc-30 functions as a transcriptional regulator within the type D neurons to control their terminal differentiation and that unc-30 is sufficient in some but not all cell types to induce GABA expression.
Cumulative damage to lung tissue by leukocyte elastase is thought to be responsible for the development of pulmonary emphysema, an irreversible lung disease characterized by loss of lung elasticity. It is also thought to be involved in the rapidly developing and usually fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome. The primary defence against elastase damage is the anti-protease known as alpha 1-antitrypsin, a glycosylated serum protein of 394 amino acids. Oxidation of the methionine 358 residue located at the active centre of alpha 1-antitrypsin results in a dramatic decrease in inhibitory activity towards elastase which effectively inactivates the protective function. It has been suggested that this oxidation sensitivity has a regulatory function and allows tissue breakdown at sites of inflammation by inactivation of alpha 1-antitrypsin by oxygen radicals released by phagocytes. In the above diseases, however, the oxidative inactivation of alpha 1-antitrypsin is probably of major importance in allowing lung damage by elastase. An oxidation-resistant alpha 1-antitrypsin required for emphysemics and provide treatment for acute inflammatory respiratory conditions. To further the possibility of therapy for the above conditions, we describe here the synthesis in yeast of active, non-glycosylated, human alpha 1-antitrypsin. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to construct an active, oxidation-resistant derivative containing a single methionine to valine substitution at the active centre. This demonstrates the potential of engineered modifications to protein molecules designed to improve their physiological function.
Familial cylindromatosis is an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumours of skin appendages called cylindromas. Familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the CYLD protein of previously unknown function. Here we show that CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis. CYLD inhibits activation of NF-kappaB by the TNFR family members CD40, XEDAR and EDAR in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD. Downregulation of CYLD by RNA-mediated interference augments both basal and CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by CYLD is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and, to a lesser extent, TRAF6. These results indicate that CYLD is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of NF-kappaB that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages.
The ability to maintain adequate nutrient intake is critical for survival. Complex interrelated neuronal circuits have developed in the mammalian brain to regulate many aspects of feeding behaviour, from food-seeking to meal termination. The hypothalamus and brainstem are thought to be the principal homeostatic brain areas responsible for regulating body weight. However, in the current 'obesogenic' human environment food intake is largely determined by non-homeostatic factors including cognition, emotion and reward, which are primarily processed in corticolimbic and higher cortical brain regions. Although the pleasure of eating is modulated by satiety and food deprivation increases the reward value of food, there is currently no adequate neurobiological account of this interaction between homeostatic and higher centres in the regulation of food intake in humans. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that peptide YY3-36 (PYY), a physiological gut-derived satiety signal, modulates neural activity within both corticolimbic and higher-cortical areas as well as homeostatic brain regions. Under conditions of high plasma PYY concentrations, mimicking the fed state, changes in neural activity within the caudolateral orbital frontal cortex predict feeding behaviour independently of meal-related sensory experiences. In contrast, in conditions of low levels of PYY, hypothalamic activation predicts food intake. Thus, the presence of a postprandial satiety factor switches food intake regulation from a homeostatic to a hedonic, corticolimbic area. Our studies give insights into the neural networks in humans that respond to a specific satiety signal to regulate food intake. An increased understanding of how such homeostatic and higher brain functions are integrated may pave the way for the development of new treatment strategies for obesity.
Angiotensin II released serotonin from neuron terminals and accelerated synthesis of the serotonin. This increase in synthesis depended on the activation of tryptophan hydroxylase. A biphasic effect was observed: at high doses the stimulatory effect depended on conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin III. At low doses an inhibitory effect was found, possible dependent on an angiotensin II metabolite. These actions represent a subtle regulation of the open-loop serotonin system.
Calcium can function as a second messenger through stimulation of calcium-dependent protein kinases. A protein kinase that requires calcium but not calmodulin or phospholipids for activity has been purified from soybean. The kinase itself binds calcium with high affinity. A complementary DNA clone for this kinase has been identified; it encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 57,175 daltons. This protein contains a catalytic domain similar to that of calmodulin-dependent kinases and a calmodulin-like region with four calcium binding domains (EF hands). The predicted structure of this kinase explains its direct regulation via calcium binding and establishes it as a prototype for a new family of calcium-regulated protein kinases.
In associative learning, the activated neurones undergo a variety of concomitant functional alterations--increases or decreases of firing activity and modifications of membrane potential or resistance and of synaptic responsiveness. Synaptic transmission which can be strengthened only when there is paired activity in two pathways is of particular interest in relation to mechanisms for associative learning. For the neocortex, there are few observations of the plastic changes, induced by conditioning procedures, in the effectiveness of individual synapses. We now report that various regimes with joint stimulations of convergent excitatory pathways on to intracellularly recorded neurones in the motor cortex of the cat result in synaptic facilitation lasting for up to 30 min.
Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2, PGI2), produced by the blood vessel wall is the most potent known inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by such stimuli as ADP and thrombin. It binds to a specific platelet receptor and activates adenylate cyclase, raising the cyclic AMP level in platelets. This property can be important because platelets participate in several significant interactions. For example, the interaction with fibrinogen or fibrin contributes to the formation of the haemostatic plug. Intact plasma fibrinogen is required for the aggregation of platelets induced by ADP, and endogenous platelet fibrinogen influences thrombin-induced aggregation. We have therefore studied the effect of prostacyclin on the interaction of fibrinogen with human platelets. We now report that prostacyclin inhibits the mobilisation of specific binding sites ('receptors') for fibrinogen on human platelets and that this effect parallels the inhibition of ADP- or thrombin-induced aggregation. The inhibitory effect of prostacyclin may limit the extent of platelet-fibrinogen interaction in vivo and in extracorporeal circulation.
Our ability to have an experience of another's pain is characteristic of empathy. Using functional imaging, we assessed brain activity while volunteers experienced a painful stimulus and compared it to that elicited when they observed a signal indicating that their loved one--present in the same room--was receiving a similar pain stimulus. Bilateral anterior insula (AI), rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), brainstem, and cerebellum were activated when subjects received pain and also by a signal that a loved one experienced pain. AI and ACC activation correlated with individual empathy scores. Activity in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex, the sensorimotor cortex (SI/MI), and the caudal ACC was specific to receiving pain. Thus, a neural response in AI and rostral ACC, activated in common for "self" and "other" conditions, suggests that the neural substrate for empathic experience does not involve the entire "pain matrix." We conclude that only that part of the pain network associated with its affective qualities, but not its sensory qualities, mediates empathy.
Hox genes control regional identity during segmentation of the vertebrate hindbrain into rhombomeres. Here we use transgenic analysis to investigate the upstream mechanisms for regulation of Hoxb-3 in rhombomere(r)5. We identified enhancers from the mouse and chick genes sufficient for r5-restricted expression. Sequence comparisons revealed two blocks of similarity (of 19 and 45 base pairs), which each contain in vitro binding sites for the kreisler protein (Kmrl1), a Maf/b-Zip protein expressed in r5 and r6 (ref. 4). Both sites are required for r5 activity, suggesting that Hoxb-3 is a direct target of kreisler. Multimers of the 19-base-pair (bp) block recreate a Krml1-like pattern in r5/r6, but the 45-bp block mediates expression only in r5. Therefore elements within the 45-bp block restrict the response to Krml1. We identified additional sequences that contain an Ets-related activation site, required for both the activation and restriction to r5. These studies demonstrate that Krml1 directly activates expression of Hoxb-3 in r5 in combination with an Ets-related activation site, and suggest that kreisler plays a primary role in regulating segmental identity through Hox genes.
Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare pediatric lung tumor that is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome. PPBs consist of mesenchymal cells that are susceptible to malignant transformation and cysts lined by epithelial cells. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the cysts by mesenchymal cells leads to sarcoma formation. Here, we show that 11 multiplex PPB families harbor heterozygous germline mutations in DICER1, a gene encoding an endoribonuclease critical to the generation of small noncoding regulatory RNAs. Expression of DICER1 protein was undetectable in the epithelial component of PPB tumors but was retained in the malignant mesenchyme (sarcoma). We hypothesize that loss of DICER1 in the epithelium of the developing lung alters the regulation of diffusible factors that promote mesenchymal proliferation.
Dopamine can be released in the substantia nigra for the dendrites of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones, to be involved there in the self-regulation of the dopaminergic cells, to control the release of neurotransmitters from nigral afferent fibres and to influence the activity of nigral non-dopaminergic cells.
The heterotrimeric AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism; in response to a fall in intracellular ATP levels it activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes. AMPK has been implicated in a number of diseases related to energy metabolism including type 2 diabetes, obesity and, most recently, cancer. AMPK is converted from an inactive form to a catalytically competent form by phosphorylation of the activation loop within the kinase domain: AMP binding to the g-regulatory domain promotes phosphorylation by the upstream kinase, protects the enzyme against dephosphorylation, as well as causing allosteric activation. Here we show that ADP binding to just one of the two exchangeable AXP (AMP/ADP/ATP) binding sites on the regulatory domain protects the enzyme from dephosphorylation, although it does not lead to allosteric activation. Our studies show that active mammalian AMPK displays significantly tighter binding to ADP than to Mg-ATP, explaining how the enzyme is regulated under physiological conditions where the concentration of Mg-ATP is higher than that of ADP and much higher than that of AMP. We have determined the crystal structure of an active AMPK complex. The structure shows how the activation loop of the kinase domain is stabilized by the regulatory domain and how the kinase linker region interacts with the regulatory nucleotide-binding site that mediates protection against dephosphorylation. From our biochemical and structural data we develop a model for how the energy status of a cell regulates AMPK activity.
Hydrogen peroxide, dialuric acid, or 6-hydroxydopamine inhibited the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin into rat brain synaptosomal preparations. The addition of catalase protected all systems, but catalase was only partially protective for 6-hydroxydopamine acting upon catecholamine uptake. The data show that 6-hydroxydopamine generates hydrogen peroxide and that hydrogen peroxide can damage the biogenic amine uptake systems. Part of the damage caused by the 6-hydroxydopamine that accumulates in the catecholamine nerve terminals in vivo may be attributed to the hydrogen peroxide.
A full understanding of the function of genes that control developmental events can be obtained only by a combination of molecular and mutational analysis. One putative developmental gene is the mouse engrailed-like gene En-2, which was isolated by virtue of its extensive homology to Drosophila engrailed, which contributes to the control of segmentation in the developing insect. Our hybridization analysis in situ has revealed that expression of En-2 is restricted to a specific domain of the developing central nervous system from 8 days of development on, indicating a role for the gene in establishing spatial domains in the brain. Unfortunately no En-2 mutations are available to elucidate further its function in development. To this end, we report here the isolation of three pluripotent embryonic stem cell lines in which one copy of the homoeobox-containing gene, En-2, has been altered by homologous recombination.
Poets have long waxed lyrical about the pain of a broken heart. Now, as Panksepp explains in his Perspective, this metaphor may reflect real events in the mammalian brain. A new brain neuroimaging study (Eisenberger et al.) reveals that the brain areas that are activated during the distress caused by social exclusion are also those activated during physical pain. Thus, we now have an explanation for the feeling of physical pain that accompanies emotional loss-whether that be the loss of a loved one, rejection by one's social group, or the distress of separation experienced by young animals.
Bone remodelling, the mechanism by which vertebrates regulate bone mass, comprises two phases, namely resorption by osteoclasts and formation by osteoblasts; osteoblasts are multifunctional cells also controlling osteoclast differentiation. Sympathetic signalling via beta2-adrenergic receptors (Adrb2) present on osteoblasts controls bone formation downstream of leptin. Here we show, by analysing Adrb2-deficient mice, that the sympathetic nervous system favours bone resorption by increasing expression in osteoblast progenitor cells of the osteoclast differentiation factor Rankl. This sympathetic function requires phosphorylation (by protein kinase A) of ATF4, a cell-specific CREB-related transcription factor essential for osteoblast differentiation and function. That bone resorption cannot increase in gonadectomized Adrb2-deficient mice highlights the biological importance of this regulation, but also contrasts sharply with the increase in bone resorption characterizing another hypogonadic mouse with low sympathetic tone, the ob/ob mouse. This discrepancy is explained, in part, by the fact that CART ('cocaine amphetamine regulated transcript'), a neuropeptide whose expression is controlled by leptin and nearly abolished in ob/ob mice, inhibits bone resorption by modulating Rankl expression. Our study establishes that leptin-regulated neural pathways control both aspects of bone remodelling, and demonstrates that integrity of sympathetic signalling is necessary for the increase in bone resorption caused by gonadal failure.
A method combining steroid autoradiography and fluorescent dye retrograde neuroanatomical tracing has been devised. This method makes it possible to demonstrate that some estrogen-concentrating cells in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial nucleus of the rat hypothalamus are neurons that send axons to the dorsal midbrain. Other cells only concentrate estrogen or only project to the midbrain. Estrogen-concentrating neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that project to the dorsal midbrain are likely to transmit hormone-influenced signals that regulate circuits for reproductive or other behaviors or autonomic functions.
Cellular responses in the V2 secondary visual cortex to simple as well as complex visual stimuli have been well studied. However, the role of area V2 in visual memory remains unexplored. We found that layer 6 neurons of V2 are crucial for the processing of object-recognition memory (ORM). Using the protein regulator of G protein signaling-14 (RGS-14) as a tool, we found that the expression of this protein into layer 6 neurons of rat-brain area V2 promoted the conversion of a normal short-term ORM that normally lasts for 45 minutes into long-term memory detectable even after many months. Furthermore, elimination of the same-layer neurons by means of injection of a selective cytotoxin resulted in the complete loss of normal as well as protein-mediated enhanced ORM.
N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) are a major class of excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system. They form glutamate-gated ion channels that are highly permeable to calcium and mediate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. NMDAR dysfunction is implicated in multiple brain disorders, including stroke, chronic pain and schizophrenia. NMDARs exist as multiple subtypes with distinct pharmacological and biophysical properties that are largely determined by the type of NR2 subunit (NR2A to NR2D) incorporated in the heteromeric NR1/NR2 complex. A fundamental difference between NMDAR subtypes is their channel maximal open probability (P(o)), which spans a 50-fold range from about 0.5 for NR2A-containing receptors to about 0.01 for receptors containing NR2C and NR2D; NR2B-containing receptors have an intermediate value (about 0.1). These differences in P(o) confer unique charge transfer capacities and signalling properties on each receptor subtype. The molecular basis for this profound difference in activity between NMDAR subtypes is unknown. Here we show that the subunit-specific gating of NMDARs is controlled by the region formed by the NR2 amino-terminal domain (NTD), an extracellular clamshell-like domain previously shown to bind allosteric inhibitors, and the short linker connecting the NTD to the agonist-binding domain (ABD). The subtype specificity of NMDAR P(o) largely reflects differences in the spontaneous (ligand-independent) equilibrium between open-cleft and closed-cleft conformations of the NR2-NTD. This NTD-driven gating control also affects pharmacological properties by setting the sensitivity to the endogenous inhibitors zinc and protons. Our results provide a proof of concept for a drug-based bidirectional control of NMDAR activity by using molecules acting either as NR2-NTD 'closers' or 'openers' promoting receptor inhibition or potentiation, respectively.
The developing chicken cerebellum contains two forms of the plasma membrane-associated actin-binding protein spectrin. The brain form, alpha gamma-spectrin (fodrin), is expressed constitutively in all neuronal cell bodies and processes during all stages of cerebellar morphogenesis. On the other hand, the erythrocyte form, alpha beta'beta-spectrin, accumulates exclusively at the plasma membrane of the cell bodies of Purkinje and granule cells and of neurons in cerebellar nuclei, but only after these cells have become postmitotic and have completed their migration to their final positions in the cerebellum. The appearance of alpha beta'beta-spectrin coincides temporally with the establishment of axosomatic contacts on these three neuronal cell types, which suggests that alpha beta'beta-spectrin accumulates in response to the formation of functional synaptic connections during cerebellar ontogeny.
Receptor-operated Ca2+ entry has been proposed as a signalling mechanism in many cells. Receptor-operated Ca2+ channels (ROCs) were first postulated in smooth muscle by Bolton, van Breemen and Somlyo and Somlyo, but recordings of directly ligand-gated Ca2+ current are lacking. Here we describe receptor-operated Ca2+ current evoked in arterial smooth muscle cells by ATP, a sympathetic neurotransmitter. ATP activates channels with approximately 3:1 selectivity for Ca2+ over Na+ at near-physiological concentrations and with a unitary conductance of approximately 5 pS in 110 mM Ca2+ or Ba2+. The channels can be opened even at very negative potentials and resist inhibition by cadmium or nifedipine, unlike voltage-gated Ca2+ channels; they are not blocked by Mg2+, unlike NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-activated channels; they are directly activated by ligand, without involvement of readily diffusible second messengers, unlike cation channels in neutrophils and T lymphocytes. Thus, the ATP-activated channels provide a distinct mechanism for excitatory synaptic current and Ca2+ entry in smooth muscle.
The innate immune system is absolutely required for host defence, but, uncontrolled, it leads to inflammatory disease. This control is mediated, in part, by cytokines that are secreted by macrophages. Immune regulation is extraordinarily complex, and can be best investigated with systems approaches (that is, using computational tools to predict regulatory networks arising from global, high-throughput data sets). Here we use cluster analysis of a comprehensive set of transcriptomic data derived from Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated macrophages to identify a prominent group of genes that appear to be regulated by activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. Network analysis predicted that ATF3 is part of a transcriptional complex that also contains members of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB family of transcription factors. Promoter analysis of the putative ATF3-regulated gene cluster demonstrated an over-representation of closely apposed ATF3 and NF-kappaB binding sites, which was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and hybridization to a DNA microarray. This cluster included important cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12b. ATF3 and Rel (a component of NF-kappaB) were shown to bind to the regulatory regions of these genes upon macrophage activation. A kinetic model of Il6 and Il12b messenger RNA expression as a function of ATF3 and NF-kappaB promoter binding predicted that ATF3 is a negative regulator of Il6 and Il12b transcription, and this hypothesis was validated using Atf3-null mice. ATF3 seems to inhibit Il6 and Il12b transcription by altering chromatin structure, thereby restricting access to transcription factors. Because ATF3 is itself induced by lipopolysaccharide, it seems to regulate TLR-stimulated inflammatory responses as part of a negative-feedback loop.
Phosphorylation of the 20,000-molecular weight (Mr) light chains of vertebrate non-muscle (thymus) and smooth muscle (gizzard) myosins regulates the assembly of these myosins into filaments in vitro. At physiological ionic strength and pH, nonphosphorylated smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin filaments are disassembled by stoichiometric levels of MgATP, forming species having sedimentation coefficients of approximately 11S (range 10-12S; myosin monomers in high salt sediment at 6S). When the 20,000 (20K)-Mr light chains on these 11S myosin species are phosphorylated by the light-chain kinase/calmodulin-Ca2+ complex, the inhibitory effect of the light chains on filament formation is removed and the myosins reassemble into filaments which are stable in MgATP. It was originally suggested that the 11S myosin species was a dimer, previously suggested as a building block for smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin filaments. It has since been shown, however, that 11S smooth muscle myosin is monomeric and has a folded conformation rather than the extended shape characteristic of monomeric myosin in high salt. Here we show that 11S non-muscle myosin is also folded and that phosphorylation of the 20K-Mr light chains of both vertebrate non-muscle (thymus) and vertebrate smooth muscle (gizzard) myosins causes these folded 11S molecules to unfold into the conventional extended monomeric form, which is able to assemble into filaments.
Although memory allocation is a subject of active research in computer science, little is known about how the brain allocates information within neural circuits. There is an extensive literature on how specific types of memory engage different parts of the brain, and how neurons in these regions process and store information. Until recently, however, the mechanisms that determine how specific cells and synapses within a neural circuit (and not their neighbors) are recruited during learning have received little attention. Recent findings suggest that memory allocation is not random, but rather specific mechanisms regulate where information is stored within a neural circuit. New methods that allow tagging, imaging, activation, and inactivation of neurons in behaving animals promise to revolutionize studies of brain circuits, including memory allocation. Results from these studies are likely to have a considerable impact on computer science, as well as on the understanding of memory and its disorders.
Brodmann's area 44 delineates part of Broca's area within the inferior frontal gyrus of the human brain and is a critical region for speech production, being larger in the left hemisphere than in the right - an asymmetry that has been correlated with language dominance. Here we show that there is a similar asymmetry in this area, also with left-hemisphere dominance, in three great ape species (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus and Gorilla gorilla). Our findings suggest that the neuroanatomical substrates for left-hemisphere dominance in speech production were evident at least five million years ago and are not unique to hominid evolution.
Developmental dyslexia is characterized by a severe reading problem in people who have normal intelligence and schooling. Impaired reading of alphabetic scripts is associated with dysfunction of left temporoparietal brain regions. These regions perform phonemic analysis and conversion of written symbols to phonological units of speech (grapheme-to-phoneme conversion); two central cognitive processes that mediate reading acquisition. Furthermore, it has been assumed that, in contrast to cultural diversities, dyslexia in different languages has a universal biological origin. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging with reading-impaired Chinese children and associated controls, that functional disruption of the left middle frontal gyrus is associated with impaired reading of the Chinese language (a logographic rather than alphabetic writing system). Reading impairment in Chinese is manifested by two deficits: one relating to the conversion of graphic form (orthography) to syllable, and the other concerning orthography-to-semantics mapping. Both of these processes are critically mediated by the left middle frontal gyrus, which functions as a centre for fluent Chinese reading that coordinates and integrates various information about written characters in verbal and spatial working memory. This finding provides an insight into the fundamental pathophysiology of dyslexia by suggesting that rather than having a universal origin, the biological abnormality of impaired reading is dependent on culture.
The neurohypophysial hormone vasopressin exerts antidiuretic, vasopressor and behavioural effects (for example, facilitation of memory processes). Vasopressin may alter animal behaviour via direct effect on brain processes. Recently, however, it has been suggested that vasopressin acts mainly at peripheral receptor systems and influences behavioural mechanisms by altering visceral afferent signals. We now present data showing that (1) central administration of [Arg8]vasopressin (AVP) and more potently [pGlu, Cyt]AVP(4-8), the desglycinamide derivative of a peptide generated from AVP by brain synaptic membranes, produce the behavioural effect (promotion of passive avoidance behaviour) without the pressor effect; (2) central administration of a vasopressor antagonist blocks the behavioural but not the pressor effect of systemically administered AVP; and (3) [pGlu, Cyt]AVP(4-8) induces the behavioural effect in the absence of the pressor effect. The results indicate that AVP and related peptides affect passive avoidance behaviour by a direct central action and that the structural requirement for activation of central vasopressin receptors differs from that of the peripheral cardiovascular receptors, although both can be blocked by the same vasopressor antagonist.
Angiotensin II is dipsogenic, and vasopressin (ADH) regulates renal water excretion. Together, these hormones govern overall mammalian water balance. The Brattleboro rat with inherited diabetes insipidus (DI) lacks ADH and is therefore a convenient model with which to elucidate mechanisms regulating water metabolism. In the present studies, angiotensin II has also been removed from DI rats by the administration of an inhibitor (captopril, SQ 14225; D-2-methyl-3-mercaptopropanoyl-L-proline) of the enzyme which converts angiotensin I, the relatively inert component of the renin-angiotensin system, to angiotensin II, the biologically active substance. SQ 14225 reduced the drinking rates, and after 6 days lowered peripheral plasma aldosterone concentrations were associated with hyperkalaemia. We conclude that the polydipsia of diabetes insipidus partly results from elevated plasma renin activities and angiotensin II concentrations seen in this syndrome. Further, the apparent hypoaldosteronism of DI Brattleboro rats reflects differences in both tissue usage of the steroid and adrenocortical sensitivities associated with polyuria, hyperosmolarity and possibly potassium wasting.
Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in a profound immunosuppression due predominantly to a selective depletion of helper/inducer T lymphocytes that express the receptor for the virus (the CD4 molecule). HIV also has tropism for the brain leading to neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Besides inducing cell death, HIV can interfere with T4 cell function by various mechanisms. The monocyte serves as a reservoir for HIV and is relatively refractory to its cytopathic effects. HIV can exist in a latent or chronic form which can be converted to a productive infection by a variety of inductive signals.
Rhythmic activity in the neocortex varies with different behavioral and pathological states and in some cases may encode sensory information. However, the neural mechanisms of these oscillations are largely unknown. Many pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the neocortex showed prolonged, 5- to 12-hertz rhythmic firing patterns at threshold. Rhythmic firing was due to intrinsic membrane properties, sodium conductances were essential for rhythmicity, and calcium-dependent conductances strongly modified rhythmicity. Isolated slices of neocortex generated epochs of 4- to 10-hertz synchronized activity when N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated channels were facilitated. Layer 5 was both necessary and sufficient to produce these synchronized oscillations. Thus, synaptic networks of intrinsically rhythmic neurons in layer 5 may generate or promote certain synchronized oscillations of the neocortex.
A method is described that allows a rat to ingest fluid through a chronic gastric tube that bypasses the oropharyngeal cavity. In this situation longterm regulation of water intake occurs in normal rats and in the rat with diabetes insipidus. Under special circumstances, a remarkable degree of excess intake can be produced.
Phosphoinositides are a family of lipid signalling molecules that regulate many cellular functions in eukaryotes. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns4,5P2), the central component in the phosphoinositide signalling circuitry, is generated primarily by type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIPKIalpha, PIPKIbeta and PIPKIgamma). In addition to functions in the cytosol, phosphoinositides are present in the nucleus, where they modulate several functions; however, the mechanism by which they directly regulate nuclear functions remains unknown. PIPKIs regulate cellular functions through interactions with protein partners, often PtdIns4,5P2 effectors, that target PIPKIs to discrete subcellular compartments, resulting in the spatial and temporal generation of PtdIns4,5P2 required for the regulation of specific signalling pathways. Therefore, to determine roles for nuclear PtdIns4,5P2 we set out to identify proteins that interacted with the nuclear PIPK, PIPKIalpha. Here we show that PIPKIalpha co-localizes at nuclear speckles and interacts with a newly identified non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, which we have termed Star-PAP (nuclear speckle targeted PIPKIalpha regulated-poly(A) polymerase) and that the activity of Star-PAP can be specifically regulated by PtdIns4,5P2. Star-PAP and PIPKIalpha function together in a complex to control the expression of select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding the key cytoprotective enzyme haem oxygenase-1 (refs 8, 9) and other oxidative stress response genes by regulating the 3'-end formation of their mRNAs. Taken together, the data demonstrate a model by which phosphoinositide signalling works in tandem with complement pathways to regulate the activity of Star-PAP and the subsequent biosynthesis of its target mRNA. The results reveal a mechanism for the integration of nuclear phosphoinositide signals and a method for regulating gene expression.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a sex-linked degenerative disorder of the muscle, is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases in man. It affects about one male in 3,500, with an estimated one-third of cases being caused by new mutations. A less severe disease, Becker's muscular dystrophy (BMD), maps to the same chromosomal locus and is most probably an allelic form of DMD. Both diseases are sometimes associated with various degrees of mental retardation; the molecular basis of these phenotypes is unknown (for review, see ref. 1). The giant DMD gene spans approximately 2,000 kilobases (kb) (0.05% of the human genome) and encodes a 14-kb mRNA. The tissue-specificity of its expression has not been precisely determined. Monaco et al., using Northern blots, reported expression of the gene in human fetal skeletal muscle and small intestine but not in human fetal brain, or in human cultured myoblasts and transformed B and T cells. More recently, expression was detected in mouse skeletal and cardiac muscle, but not in mouse brain. Here we show, using a ribonuclease protection assay, that the DMD gene is developmentally regulated in rat and mouse myogenic cell cultures, and that it is expressed in rat and mouse striated muscle, in mouse smooth muscle and in rat, mouse and rabbit brain. We could not detect transcripts in other non-muscle tissues.
In cats anesthetized with chloralose-pentobarbital and artificially ventilated, electrical stimulation of the caudal end of the cut cervical vagus nerve has a biphasic effect on the bronchoconstriction induced by an intravenous infusion of serotonin. The response consists of a brief augmentation of bronchoconstriction followed by relatively prolonged bronchodilation. After muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine, vagal stimulation causes only bronchodilation. Vagally mediated bronchodilation is not affected by beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol, alpha adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine, or adrenergic neuronal blockade with guanethidine, but is abolished by autonomic ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium. These findings support the conclusion that a nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system is present in the pulmonary airways of the cat and that the system is supplied by preganglionic fibers in the cervical vagus nerves.
Working memory is a key function for human cognition, dependent on adequate dopamine neurotransmission. Here we show that the training of working memory, which improves working memory capacity, is associated with changes in the density of cortical dopamine D1 receptors. Fourteen hours of training over 5 weeks was associated with changes in both prefrontal and parietal D1 binding potential. This plasticity of the dopamine D1 receptor system demonstrates a reciprocal interplay between mental activity and brain biochemistry in vivo.
Exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) reproduces certain clinical, pathological, and neurochemical features of Parkinson's disease. MPTP is metabolized by monoamine oxidase Type B to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+), which is selectively accumulated by high-affinity uptake mechanisms into dopaminergic neurons. Lyden et al. described low-affinity binding of MPTP to synthetic and retinal melanin. We showed that MPP+ binds to neuromelanin with high affinity, suggesting that in MPTP neurotoxicity, MPP+ enters nigral neurons by the dopamine uptake system and binds to neuromelanin, which serves as a depot, continuously releasing MPP+ until it destroys the cells. This model predicts that agents which compete with MPP+ binding to neuromelanin should partially protect the dopamine neurons from MPTP-induced toxicity. The most potent identified competitor for MPP+ binding to melanin is the antimalarial drug chloroquine, which has a high affinity for melanins. In the present study, chloroquine, administered to monkeys in conventional anti-malarial doses before MPTP, protects them from MPTP-induced parkinsonian motor abnormalities, dopamine depletion in the striatum, and neuropathological changes in the substantia nigra.
Olfactory sensory neurons detect a large variety of odor molecules and send information through their axons to the olfactory bulb, the first site for the processing of olfactory information in the brain. The axonal connection is precisely organized so that signals from 1000 different types of odorant receptors are sorted out in 1800 glomeruli in the mouse olfactory bulb. Individual glomerular modules presumably represent a single type of receptor and are thus tuned to specific molecular features of odorants. Local neuronal circuits in the bulb mediate lateral inhibition among glomerular modules to sharpen the tuning specificity of output neurons. They also mediate synchronized oscillatory discharges among specific combinations of output neurons and may contribute to the integration of signals from distinct odorant receptors in the olfactory cortex.
Dementia is common in patients with AIDS, but the mechanism by which the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) causes the neurological impairment is unknown. In this study the possibility that an antigen of HIV-1 suppresses neuronal responses to neurotrophic factors was examined. Both HIV-1 and a related retrovirus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), inhibited the growth of sensory neurons from chick dorsal root ganglia in medium containing neuroleukin (NLK) but not in medium containing nerve growth factor. An unrelated type D retrovirus, simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus, did not affect the growth of neurons in the presence of either neurotrophic factor. The inhibition by HIV-1 of neuron growth in the presence of NLK was found to be due to the gp120 envelope glycoprotein. Regions of sequence homology between gp120 and NLK may account for this inhibitory property of gp120 and functional interactions between gp120 and NLK may be important in the pathogenesis of the AIDS dementia complex.
Some neurons in the visual cortex of awake monkeys visually tracking a moving target showed receptive fields that were excited only by stimulus motion relative to a background, while other neurons responded to any kind of stimulus motion. This result was found with two methods, one in which tracking eye movements were identical in both relative-motion and absolute-motion conditions, and another in which stimulus motions on the retina were identical in both conditions. This response pattern can differentiate translation of the retinal image during eye movement from motion of objects in the world.
Developmental integration results from coordination among components of different embryonic fields to realize the later anatomical and functional relationships. We demonstrate that in the chick head, integration between the epibranchial placodes and the hindbrain is achieved as the neuroglial hindbrain crest cells guide the epibranchial neuronal cells inward to establish their central connections. This work defines a role for the neuroglial hindbrain crest in organizing the afferent innervation of the hindbrain.
Complementary DNAs corresponding to the interferon (IFN)-induced messenger RNAs for histocompatibility locus antigens (HLA), metallothionein-II (MT2), 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and about eight other proteins of unknown sequence have been isolated recently, and by interferon regulation of transcription has been demonstrated for several of the eight mRNAs, with a significant increase apparent in as little as 5 min. We now show that IFN-alpha treatment results in a three- to fivefold increase in the transcription of MT2 and HLA class I genes in human T98G neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, comparison of regions upstream of the MT2A gene, two HLA genes and one HLA class II gene reveals a homologous sequence of approximately 30 base pairs (bp) which may be involved in regulating transcription of interferon-induced genes. Transcription of the mRNA for human MT2A is induced by glucocorticoids or metal ions and the regulatory elements have been mapped by promoter-fusion experiments. We now show that the rate of transcription of MT2A is the same on treatment with interferon or dexamethasone, but that the mRNA accumulates much faster with dexamethasone, indicating that post-transcriptional events are important in the latter case.
A large number of structurally diverse drugs with clinical antidepressant properties share the ability to act as potent inhibitors of histamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in cell-free preparations from mammalian brain. This common biochemical action may represent part of the molecular basis for the antidepressant properties of these compounds.
Protein phosphorylation represents an approach, sometimes the only approach available, to study the molecular basis for a wide variety of neurophysiological phenomena. The injection of protein kinases or protein kinase inhibitors into neurones has provided direct evidence that activation of protein kinases has an obligatory role in the mechanisms by which numerous extracellular signals produce specific physiological responses in neurones. A diversity of substrate proteins for the kinases have already been found. In several instances, the identity and functional role of these substrate proteins have been established.
Brain research on mental illnesses has made substantial advances in recent years, supported by conceptual and technological developments in cognitive neuroscience. Brain-based cognitive models of illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression have been tested with a variety of techniques, including the lesion method, tract tracing, neuroimaging, animal modeling, single-cell recording, electrophysiology, neuropsychology, and experimental cognitive psychology. A relatively sophisticated picture is emerging that conceptualizes mental illnesses as disorders of mind arising in the brain. Convergent data using multiple neuroscience techniques indicate that the neural mechanisms of mental illnesses can be understood as dysfunctions in specific neural circuits and that their functions and dysfunctions can be influenced or altered by a variety of cognitive and pharmacological factors.
Three distinct classes of protein kinases have been shown to regulate Ca2+ current in excitable tissues. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase mediates the action of noradrenaline on the Ca2+ current of cardiac muscle cells. Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase mediates the serotonin-induced modulation of the Ca2+ current in identified snail neurons. The Ca2+/diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) has also been found to regulate Ca2+ currents of neurons. However, no neurotransmitter has yet been shown to regulate Ca2+ current through the activation of protein kinase C. We now report that cholecystokinin, a widely occurring neuropeptide which is present in molluscan neuron, modulates the Ca2+ current in identified neurons of the snail Helix aspersa, and that this effect appears to be mediated by protein kinase C. Specifically, sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide 26-33 (CCK8), activators of protein kinase C, and intracellular injection of protein kinase C, all shorten the Ca2+-dependent action potential and decrease the amplitude of the Ca2+ current in these cells. All these effects are not reversible within the duration of the experiments. Moreover, intracellular injections of low concentrations of protein kinase C, which are ineffective by themselves, enhance the effectiveness of low concentrations of CCK8 on the Ca2+ current.
Somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell fusion, or expression of lineage-specific factors have been shown to induce cell-fate changes in diverse somatic cell types. We recently observed that forced expression of a combination of three transcription factors, Brn2 (also known as Pou3f2), Ascl1 and Myt1l, can efficiently convert mouse fibroblasts into functional induced neuronal (iN) cells. Here we show that the same three factors can generate functional neurons from human pluripotent stem cells as early as 6 days after transgene activation. When combined with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NeuroD1, these factors could also convert fetal and postnatal human fibroblasts into iN cells showing typical neuronal morphologies and expressing multiple neuronal markers, even after downregulation of the exogenous transcription factors. Importantly, the vast majority of human iN cells were able to generate action potentials and many matured to receive synaptic contacts when co-cultured with primary mouse cortical neurons. Our data demonstrate that non-neural human somatic cells, as well as pluripotent stem cells, can be converted directly into neurons by lineage-determining transcription factors. These methods may facilitate robust generation of patient-specific human neurons for in vitro disease modelling or future applications in regenerative medicine.
The effects of conflicting visual images were studied without the confounding influences of oculomotor abnormalities: strabismus was simulated by rearing kittens with ophthalmic prisms before the eyes. After the animals had matured, the response properties of neurons in the visual cortex were studied. The proportion of binocularly excited neurons decreased; however, the extent of the ocular dominance alterations was related to the amount and direction of the prism-induced deviation.
Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed anxiolytics and anticonvulsants which bind with high affinity to sites on the GABAA receptor/Cl- channel complex and potentiate the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). The heterogeneity of benzodiazepine recognition sites in the central nervous system was revealed by studies showing different classes of GABAA receptor subunits (classes alpha, beta and gamma) and variant subunits in these classes, particularly in the alpha-class. Expression of recombinant subunits produces functional receptors; when certain alpha-variants are coexpressed with beta- and gamma-subunits the resulting receptors have pharmacological properties characteristic of GABAA-benzodiazepine type I or type II receptors. The alpha-variants are differentially expressed in the central nervous system and can be photoaffinity-labelled with benzodiazepines. Here we report a novel alpha-subunit (alpha 6) of cerebellar granule cells. We show that recombinant receptors composed of alpha 6, beta 2 and gamma 2 subunits bind with high affinity to the GABA agonist [3H]muscimol and the benzodiazepine [3H]Ro15-4513 but not the other benzodiazepines or beta-carboniles. The same distinctive pharmacology is observed with GABAA receptors from rat cerebellum immunoprecipitated by an antiserum specific for the alpha 6 subunit. We conclude that this alpha-subunit is part of a cerebellar receptor subtype, selective for Ro15-4513, an antagonist of alcohol-induced motor incoordination and ataxia.
It is well established that electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) causes a reduction in food intake, whereas electrolytic or chemical lesions in this area result in hyperphagia and obesity in the rat. This has led to the suggestion that either the ventromedial nucleus itself, or nerve fibres passing close by, are important in the control of food intake. However, obesity due to VMH lesions occurs in weanling rats in the absence of hyperphagia and can develop in adult rats pair-fed with controls, indicating that destruction of this area also causes an increased metabolic efficiency (that is, a reduced energy expenditure). In normal rats, hyperphagia induced by feeding a highly palatable cafeteria diet is often accompanied by a large increase in heat production (diet-induced thermogenesis) which tends to prevent excessive weight gain and obesity. This diet-induced thermogenesis is due to sympathetic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and we have now investigated the possibility that the VMH is involved in the activation of this process. We found that electrical stimulation of this area produced increased BAT thermogenesis, which suggests that the VMH exerts a dual influence in the regulation of energy balance--an inhibitory effect on energy intake and a stimulatory effect on thermogenesis and energy output.
Population density-dependent dispersal is a well-characterized strategy of animal behavior in which dispersal rate increases when population density is higher. Caenorhabditis elegans shows positive chemotaxis to a set of odorants, but the chemotaxis switches from attraction to dispersal after prolonged exposure to the odorants. We show here that this plasticity of olfactory behavior is dependent on population density and that this regulation is mediated by pheromonal signaling. We show that a peptide, suppressor of NEP-2 (SNET-1), negatively regulates olfactory plasticity and that its expression is down-regulated by the pheromone. NEP-2, a homolog of the extracellular peptidase neprilysin, antagonizes SNET-1, and this function is essential for olfactory plasticity. These results suggest that population density information is transmitted through the external pheromone and endogenous peptide signaling to modulate chemotactic behavior.
The mammalian olfactory system mediates various responses, including aversive behaviours to spoiled foods and fear responses to predator odours. In the olfactory bulb, each glomerulus represents a single species of odorant receptor. Because a single odorant can interact with several different receptor species, the odour information received in the olfactory epithelium is converted to a topographical map of multiple glomeruli activated in distinct areas in the olfactory bulb. To study how the odour map is interpreted in the brain, we generated mutant mice in which olfactory sensory neurons in a specific area of the olfactory epithelium are ablated by targeted expression of the diphtheria toxin gene. Here we show that, in dorsal-zone-depleted mice, the dorsal domain of the olfactory bulb was devoid of glomerular structures, although second-order neurons were present in the vacant areas. The mutant mice lacked innate responses to aversive odorants, even though they were capable of detecting them and could be conditioned for aversion with the remaining glomeruli. These results indicate that, in mice, aversive information is received in the olfactory bulb by separate sets of glomeruli, those dedicated for innate and those for learned responses.
Rhodamine-123, a cationic laser dye, markedly reduced the clonal growth of carcinoma cells but had little effect on nontumorigenic epithelial cells in vitro. This selective inhibitory effect of Rhodamine-123 on some carcinomas is unusual since known anticancer drugs, such as arabinosyl cytosine and methotrexate, have not been shown to exhibit such selectivity in vitro.
Bone marrow stem cells give rise to a variety of hematopoietic lineages and repopulate the blood throughout adult life. We show that, in a strain of mice incapable of developing cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, transplanted adult bone marrow cells migrated into the brain and differentiated into cells that expressed neuron-specific antigens. These findings raise the possibility that bone marrow-derived cells may provide an alternative source of neurons in patients with neurodegenerative diseases or central nervous system injury.
Modules of neurons sharing a common property are a basic organizational feature of mammalian sensory cortex. Primary visual cortex (V1) is characterized by orientation modules--groups of cells that share a preferred stimulus orientation--which are organized into a highly ordered orientation map. Here we show that in ferrets in which retinal projections are routed into the auditory pathway, visually responsive neurons in 'rewired' primary auditory cortex are also organized into orientation modules. The orientation tuning of neurons within these modules is comparable to the tuning of cells in V1 but the orientation map is less orderly. Horizontal connections in rewired cortex are more patchy and periodic than connections in normal auditory cortex, but less so than connections in V1. These data show that afferent activity has a profound influence on diverse components of cortical circuitry, including thalamocortical and local intracortical connections, which are involved in the generation of orientation tuning, and long-range horizontal connections, which are important in creating an orientation map.
Gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors are the principal mediators of synaptic inhibition, and yet when intensely activated, dendritic GABAA receptors excite rather than inhibit neurons. The membrane depolarization mediated by GABAA receptors is a result of the differential, activity-dependent collapse of the opposing concentration gradients of chloride and bicarbonate, the anions that permeate the GABAA ionophore. Because this depolarization diminishes the voltage-dependent block of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by magnesium, the activity-dependent depolarization mediated by GABA is sufficient to account for frequency modulation of synaptic NMDA receptor activation. Anionic gradient shifts may represent a mechanism whereby the rate and coherence of synaptic activity determine whether dendritic GABAA receptor activation is excitatory or inhibitory.
The molecular control of self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells has remained enigmatic. Transgenic loss-of-function and overexpression models now show that the dosage of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), produced by Sertoli cells, regulates cell fate decisions of undifferentiated spermatogonial cells that include the stem cells for spermatogenesis. Gene-targeted mice with one GDNF-null allele show depletion of stem cell reserves, whereas mice overexpressing GDNF show accumulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia. They are unable to respond properly to differentiation signals and undergo apoptosis upon retinoic acid treatment. Nonmetastatic testicular tumors are regularly formed in older GDNF-overexpressing mice. Thus, GDNF contributes to paracrine regulation of spermatogonial self-renewal and differentiation.
When mapped with white light, each receptive field consisted either of an excitatory ("on") center and a concentric inhibitory ("off") surround, or of the reverse arrangement. Monochromatic stimuli revealed that each receptive field was composed of two mutually antagonistic components (one excitatory, one inhibitory) which had different spectral sensitivities and different spatial distributions. For some units the two chromatic components had identical spatial distributions.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates cellular metabolism in response to the availability of energy and is therefore a target for type II diabetes treatment. It senses changes in the ratio of AMP/ATP by binding both species in a competitive manner. Thus, increases in the concentration of AMP activate AMPK resulting in the phosphorylation and differential regulation of a series of downstream targets that control anabolic and catabolic pathways. We report here the crystal structure of the regulatory fragment of mammalian AMPK in complexes with AMP and ATP. The phosphate groups of AMP/ATP lie in a groove on the surface of the gamma domain, which is lined with basic residues, many of which are associated with disease-causing mutations. Structural and solution studies reveal that two sites on the gamma domain bind either AMP or Mg.ATP, whereas a third site contains a tightly bound AMP that does not exchange. Our binding studies indicate that under physiological conditions AMPK mainly exists in its inactive form in complex with Mg.ATP, which is much more abundant than AMP. Our modelling studies suggest how changes in the concentration of AMP ([AMP]) enhance AMPK activity levels. The structure also suggests a mechanism for propagating AMP/ATP signalling whereby a phosphorylated residue from the alpha and/or beta subunits binds to the gamma subunit in the presence of AMP but not when ATP is bound.
Recombinant mouse prion protein (recMoPrP) produced in Escherichia coli was polymerized into amyloid fibrils that represent a subset of beta sheet-rich structures. Fibrils consisting of recMoPrP(89-230) were inoculated intracerebrally into transgenic (Tg) mice expressing MoPrP(89-231). The mice developed neurologic dysfunction between 380 and 660 days after inoculation. Brain extracts showed protease-resistant PrP by Western blotting; these extracts transmitted disease to wild-type FVB mice and Tg mice overexpressing PrP, with incubation times of 150 and 90 days, respectively. Neuropathological findings suggest that a novel prion strain was created. Our results provide compelling evidence that prions are infectious proteins.
The AP-1 family of transcription factors, which includes the proto-oncogene products c-Jun and c-Fos, controls the stimulation of cellular genes by growth factors and the expression of oncogenes, including src and ras. Transcriptional activation by c-Jun is regulated by a cell-type-specific inhibitor that represses the activity of a transcriptional activation domain (A1) of c-Jun by operating through the adjacent negative regulatory region (delta). Here we show that cotransfection of the src or ras oncogene enhances the transcriptional activity of a GAL4:c-Jun hybrid that includes the delta-A1 region of c-Jun, suggesting that the DNA binding and dimerization domain of c-Jun is not required for stimulation by Src or Ras. Moreover, induction of c-Jun activity by Src and Ras occurs in cell lines containing the c-Jun inhibitor but not in a cell line lacking it. The region in c-Jun essential for the stimulatory action of these oncogenes maps to domain A1. These findings suggest the existence of signal-transduction pathways that result in an increase in transcriptional activity of c-Jun and AP-1 by disrupting the c-Jun:inhibitor interaction.
Male American cockroaches walk a zigzag path upwind toward a source of female sex pheromone. Although the maximum width of the pathway is regulated by the width of an odor plume, many turns are made before the edge of a wide plume is encountered. In addition to the pheromone regulation of the insect's orientation movements, an internal mechanism appears to influence the zigzag turning pattern.
Electrical synapses are common between inhibitory neurons in the mammalian thalamus and neocortex. Synaptic modulation, which allows flexibility of communication between neurons, has been studied extensively at chemical synapses, but modulation of electrical synapses in the mammalian brain has barely been examined. We found that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, via endogenous neurotransmitter or by agonist, causes long-term reduction of electrical synapse strength between the inhibitory neurons of the rat thalamic reticular nucleus.
The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) regulates progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The activity of CDK4 is controlled by the opposing effects of the D-type cyclin, an activating subunit, and p16INK4, an inhibitory subunit. Ectopic expression of p16INK4 blocked entry into S phase of the cell cycle induced by oncogenic Ha-Ras, and this block was relieved by coexpression of a catalytically inactive CDK4 mutant. Expression of p16INK4 suppressed cellular transformation of primary rat embryo fibroblasts by oncogenic Ha-Ras and Myc, but not by Ha-Ras and E1a. Together, these observations provide direct evidence that p16INK4 can inhibit cell growth.
Neuronal death induced by activating N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been linked to Ca2+ and Na+ influx through associated channels. Whole-cell recording from cultured mouse cortical neurons revealed a NMDA-evoked outward current, INMDA-K, carried by K+ efflux at membrane potentials positive to -86 millivolts. Cortical neurons exposed to NMDA in medium containing reduced Na+ and Ca2+ (as found in ischemic brain tissue) lost substantial intracellular K+ and underwent apoptosis. Both K+ loss and apoptosis were attenuated by increasing extracellular K+, even when voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were blocked. Thus NMDA receptor-mediated K+ efflux may contribute to neuronal apoptosis after brain ischemia.
Neurotransmitter can modulate neuronal activity through a variety of second messengers that act on ion channels and other substrate proteins. The most commonly described effector mechanism for second messengers in neurons depends on protein phosphorylation mediated by one of three sets of kinases: the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases, the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, and the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinases. In addition, some neurotransmitters and second messengers can also inhibit protein phosphorylation by lowering cAMP levels (either by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase or activating phosphodiesterases). This raises the question: can neurotransmitters also modulate neuronal activity by decreasing protein phosphorylation that is independent of cAMP? Various biochemical experiments show that a decrease in protein phosphorylation can arise through activation of a phosphatase or inhibition of kinases. In none of these cases, however, is the physiological role for the decrease in protein phosphorylation known. Here we report that in Aplysia sensory neurons, the presynaptic inhibitory transmitter FMRFamide decreases the resting levels of protein phosphorylation without altering the level of cAMP. Furthermore, FMRFamide overrides the cAMP-mediated enhancement of transmitter release produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and concomitantly reverses the cAMP-dependent increase in protein phosphorylation produced by 5-HT. These findings indicate that a receptor-mediated decrease in protein phosphorylation may play an important part in the modulation of neurotransmitter release.
Transmembrane helices of integrin alpha and beta subunits have been implicated in the regulation of integrin activity. Two mutations, glycine-708 to asparagine-708 (G708N)and methionine-701 to asparagine-701, in the transmembrane helix of the beta3 subunit enabled integrin alphaIIbbeta3 to constitutively bind soluble fibrinogen. Further characterization of the G708N mutant revealed that it induced alphaIIbbeta3 clustering and constitutive phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. This mutation also enhanced the tendency of the transmembrane helix to form homotrimers. These results suggest that homomeric associations involving transmembrane domains provide a driving force for integrin activation. They also suggest a structural basis for the coincidence of integrin activation and clustering.
In accordance with its important role in prehensile activity, a large cortical area is devoted to representation of the digits. Within this large cortical zone in the macaque somatosensory cortex, the complexity of neuronal receptive field characteristics increases from area 3b to areas 1 and 2 (refs 1-7). This increase in complexity continues into the upper bank of the intraparietal sulcus, where the somatosensory cortex adjoins the parietal association cortex. In this bank, callosal connections are much denser than in the more anterior part of this cortical zone. We have now discovered a substantial number of neurons with receptive fields on the bilateral hands. It was previously thought that neuronal receptive fields were restricted to the contralateral side in this cortical zone. Neurons with bilateral receptive fields were not found after lesioning the postcentral gyrus in the contralateral hemisphere. The majority of these neurons had receptive fields of the most complex types, representing multiple digits, indicating that the interhemispheric transfer of information occurs at higher levels of the hierarchical processing in each hemisphere.
Congeners of nitrogen monoxide (NO) are neuroprotective and neurodestructive. To address this apparent paradox, we considered the effects on neurons of compounds characterized by alternative redox states of NO: nitric oxide (NO.) and nitrosonium ion (NO+). Nitric oxide, generated from NO. donors or synthesized endogenously after NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor activation, can lead to neurotoxicity. Here, we report that NO.- mediated neurotoxicity is engendered, at least in part, by reaction with superoxide anion (O2.-), apparently leading to formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and not by NO. alone. In contrast, the neuroprotective effects of NO result from downregulation of NMDA-receptor activity by reaction with thiol group(s) of the receptor's redox modulatory site. This reaction is not mediated by NO. itself, but occurs under conditions supporting S-nitrosylation of NMDA receptor thiol (reaction or transfer of NO+). Moreover, the redox versatility of NO allows for its interconversion from neuroprotective to neurotoxic species by a change in the ambient redox milieu. The details of this complex redox chemistry of NO may provide a mechanism for harnessing neuroprotective effects and avoiding neurotoxicity in the central nervous system.
Loss of function of the gene SCN9A, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v)1.7, causes a congenital inability to experience pain in humans. Here we show that Na(v)1.7 is not only necessary for pain sensation but is also an essential requirement for odour perception in both mice and humans. We examined human patients with loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A and show that they are unable to sense odours. To establish the essential role of Na(v)1.7 in odour perception, we generated conditional null mice in which Na(v)1.7 was removed from all olfactory sensory neurons. In the absence of Na(v)1.7, these neurons still produce odour-evoked action potentials but fail to initiate synaptic signalling from their axon terminals at the first synapse in the olfactory system. The mutant mice no longer display vital, odour-guided behaviours such as innate odour recognition and avoidance, short-term odour learning, and maternal pup retrieval. Our study creates a mouse model of congenital general anosmia and provides new strategies to explore the genetic basis of the human sense of smell.
Regulating the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) family of transcription factors is of critical importance to animals, with consequences of misregulation that include cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases and developmental defects. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have proved fruitful in determining the signals used to control NF-kappaB proteins, beginning with the discovery that the Toll/NF-kappaB pathway, in addition to patterning the dorsal-ventral axis of the fly embryo, defines a major component of the innate immune response in both Drosophila and mammals. Here, we characterize the Drosophila wntD (Wnt inhibitor of Dorsal) gene. We show that WntD acts as a feedback inhibitor of the NF-kappaB homologue Dorsal during both embryonic patterning and the innate immune response to infection. wntD expression is under the control of Toll/Dorsal signalling, and increased levels of WntD block Dorsal nuclear accumulation, even in the absence of the IkappaB homologue Cactus. The WntD signal is independent of the common Wnt signalling component Armadillo (beta-catenin). By engineering a gene knockout, we show that wntD loss-of-function mutants have immune defects and exhibit increased levels of Toll/Dorsal signalling. Furthermore, the wntD mutant phenotype is suppressed by loss of zygotic dorsal. These results describe the first secreted feedback antagonist of Toll signalling, and demonstrate a novel Wnt activity in the fly.
Tyrosine protein phosphorylation is necessary for antigen receptor-mediated activation of T lymphocytes. This signal is generated at least in part by the Src-related tyrosine protein kinases p56lck and p59fynT (refs 2, 3). The activity of these two enzymes is repressed by phosphorylation of a conserved carboxy-terminal tyrosine residue. Recent studies suggest that this inhibitory phosphorylation may be caused by p50csk (for C-terminal Src kinase), a tyrosine protein kinase which accumulates most abundantly in thymus and spleen. To investigate the function of Csk in T lymphocytes and characterize the processes regulating T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling, we examined the effects of overexpression of Csk on the physiology of an antigen-specific mouse T-cell line. We report here that p50csk negatively regulates TCR-induced tyrosine protein phosphorylation and lymphokine production. This provides evidence for the involvement of Csk in the regulation of T-cell activation.
N-type calcium channels in cell membranes are inhibited by neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. Although GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) are probably the common mediators of such inhibition, it is unclear exactly how G proteins alter the operation of the channel. Various experiments have shown changes in channel gating. Here we show that inward current carried by Na+ through N-type channels was far less inhibited by LHRH or by internal GTP-gamma S than was current carried by Ba2+. With external Ba2+ and internal Cs+, LHRH inhibited the Ba(2+)-carried inward limb of the instantaneous current-voltage curve much more than the Cs(+)-carried outward limb. Noise analysis showed that LHRH or GTP-gamma S decrease single-channel current carried by Ba2+. These results suggest that alteration of the ion permeation pathway contributes significantly to G-protein inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels.
Mice deficient for the gene encoding alpha-calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (alpha-CaMKII knockout mice) provide a promising tool to link behavioral and cellular abnormalities with a specific molecular lesion. The heterozygous mouse exhibited a well-circumscribed syndrome of behavioral abnormalities, consisting primarily of a decreased fear response and an increase in defensive aggression, in the absence of any measured cognitive deficits. Unlike the heterozygote, the homozygote displayed abnormal behavior in all paradigms tested. At the cellular level, both extracellular and whole-cell patch clamp recordings indicated that serotonin release in putative serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe was reduced. Thus, alpha-CaMKII knockout mice, in particular the heterozygote, may provide a model for studying the molecular and cellular basis underlying emotional disorders involving fear and aggression.
Prolonged treatment with classical antipsychotic drugs decreased the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons in both the substantia nigra (A9) and the ventral tegmental area (A10) of the rat brain. In contrast, treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs selectively decreased the number of A10 dopamine neurons. Related drugs lacking antipsychotic efficacy failed to decrease dopamine activity. These findings suggest that the inability of atypical antipsychotic drugs to decrease A9 dopamine neuronal activity may be related to their lower potential for causing tardive dyskinesia and that the inactivation of A10 neurons may be involved in the delayed onset of therapeutic effects during treatment.
It takes a fraction of a second to recognize a person or an object even when seen under strikingly different conditions. How such a robust, high-level representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear. In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle. We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes. Here we report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant, sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.
Insulin receptors (IRs) and insulin signaling proteins are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS). To study the physiological role of insulin signaling in the brain, we created mice with a neuron-specific disruption of the IR gene (NIRKO mice). Inactivation of the IR had no impact on brain development or neuronal survival. However, female NIRKO mice showed increased food intake, and both male and female mice developed diet-sensitive obesity with increases in body fat and plasma leptin levels, mild insulin resistance, elevated plasma insulin levels, and hypertriglyceridemia. NIRKO mice also exhibited impaired spermatogenesis and ovarian follicle maturation because of hypothalamic dysregulation of luteinizing hormone. Thus, IR signaling in the CNS plays an important role in regulation of energy disposal, fuel metabolism, and reproduction.
Evidence suggests that both alpha and beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Although type I adenylyl cyclase is inhibited directly by exogenous beta gamma, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by Gi alpha has not been convincingly demonstrated in vitro. Concentration-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclases by purified Gi alpha subunits is described. Activated Gi alpha but not G(o) alpha was effective, and myristoylation of Gi alpha was required. The characteristics of the inhibitory effect were dependent on the type of adenylyl cyclase and the nature of the activator of the enzyme. The concentrations of Gi alpha required to inhibit adenylyl cyclase were substantially higher than those normally thought to be relevant physiologically. However, analysis indicates that these concentrations may be relevant and reasonable.
Levels of acetylcholine were significantly elevated in the telencephalon and diencephalon + mesencephalon of rats killed by near-freezing during conditioned suppression of food-reinforced lever pressing, whereas levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine were not altered. These neurochemical changes were not seen in rats serving as controls for conditioning experience, activity levels, or stimulus presentation.
Optical imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution of neural activity in rat cortical slices was used to investigate the dynamics of signal transmission through neural connections in the visual cortex. When inhibition due to gamma-aminobutyric acid was slightly suppressed, horizontal propagation of excitation in both the supra- and infragranular layers became prominent. This propagation was not affected by vertical cuts in either the supra- or infragranular layer, which suggests that excitation is at least partially conveyed horizontally by reciprocal vertical connections between neurons in these layers.
The transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP (CREBBP) is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that regulates gene expression by acetylating histones and other transcription factors. Dysregulation of p300/CBP HAT activity contributes to various diseases including cancer. Sequence alignments, enzymology experiments and inhibitor studies on p300/CBP have led to contradictory results about its catalytic mechanism and its structural relation to the Gcn5/PCAF and MYST HATs. Here we describe a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of a semi-synthetic heterodimeric p300 HAT domain in complex with a bi-substrate inhibitor, Lys-CoA. This structure shows that p300/CBP is a distant cousin of other structurally characterized HATs, but reveals several novel features that explain the broad substrate specificity and preference for nearby basic residues. Based on this structure and accompanying biochemical data, we propose that p300/CBP uses an unusual 'hit-and-run' (Theorell-Chance) catalytic mechanism that is distinct from other characterized HATs. Several disease-associated mutations can also be readily accounted for by the p300 HAT structure. These studies pave the way for new epigenetic therapies involving modulation of p300/CBP HAT activity.
Natural killer (NK) cells destroy virus-infected and tumour cells, apparently without the need for previous antigen stimulation. In part, target cells are recognized by their diminished expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which normally interact with inhibitory receptors on the NK cell surface. NK cells also express triggering receptors that are specific for non-MHC ligands; but the nature of the ligands recognized on target cells is undefined. NKp46 is thought to be the main activating receptor for human NK cells. Here we show that a soluble NKp46-immunoglobulin fusion protein binds to both the haemagglutinin of influenza virus and the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase of parainfluenza virus. In a substantial subset of NK cells, recognition by NKp46 is required to lyse cells expressing the corresponding viral glycoproteins. The binding requires the sialylation of NKp46 oligosaccharides, which is consistent with the known sialic binding capacity of the viral glycoproteins. These findings indicate how NKp46-expressing NK cells may recognize target cells infected by influenza or parainfluenza without the decreased expression of target-cell MHC class I protein.
The neural mechanisms underlying the transition from a drug-nondependent to a drug-dependent state remain elusive. Chronic exposure to drugs has been shown to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. BDNF infusions into the VTA potentiate several behavioral effects of drugs, including psychomotor sensitization and cue-induced drug seeking. We found that a single infusion of BDNF into the VTA promotes a shift from a dopamine-independent to a dopamine-dependent opiate reward system, identical to that seen when an opiate-naive rat becomes dependent and withdrawn. This shift involves a switch in the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors of VTA GABAergic neurons, from inhibitory to excitatory signaling.
Cellular resistance to insulin caused by a reduction in insulin-mediated glucose uptake can be produced in rats by chemically inducing diabetes with streptozotocin and by fasting. Two glucose transporter isoforms are expressed in fat cells: (1) the insulin-responsive species which is found only in fat and muscle, and (2) a species corresponding to the erythrocyte/Hep G2/rat brain transporter. We show here that fat cells isolated from streptozotocin diabetic rats and from fasted rats show a significant (60-80%) decrease in the amount of immunologically detectable insulin-sensitive glucose transporter and no change in the level of the Hep G2/rat brain transporter. Administration of insulin and refeeding, respectively, result in a return of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter to levels that are normal or slightly above normal. Thus, peripheral tissue insulin resistance could be due to the specific reduction in the amount of insulin-sensitive glucose transporter.
Touching warm and cool bars that are spatially interlaced produces a painful burning sensation resembling that caused by intense, noxious cold. We demonstrated previously that this thermal grill illusion can be explained as an unmasking phenomenon that reveals the central inhibition of pain by thermosensory integration. In order to localize this unmasking in the human brain, we have used positron emission tomography (PET) to compare the cortical activation patterns evoked by the thermal grill and by cool, warm, noxious cold and noxious heat stimuli. The thermal grill illusion produces activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas its component warm and cool stimuli do not. This area is also activated by noxious heat or cold. Thus, increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex appears to be selectively associated with the perception of thermal pain. Disruption of thermosensory and pain integration may account for the central pain syndrome that can occur after stroke damage.
Cell membrane receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters form oligomeric complexes with GTP-regulatory proteins and inhibit the latter from reacting with GTP. Hormones and neurotransmitters act by releasing the inhibitory constraints imposed by the receptors, thus allowing the GTP-regulatory proteins to interact with and control the activity of enzymes such as adenylate cyclase. This theory may apply generally to membrane signal transduction involving surface receptors.
Tritiated naloxone, a powerful opiate antagonist, specifically binds to an opiate receptor of mammalian brain and guinea pig intestine. Competition for the opiate receptor by various opiates and their antagonists closely parallels their pharmacological potency. The opiate receptor is confined to nervous tissue.
Motility is a universal property of newly generated neurons. How cell migration is coordinately regulated with other aspects of neuron production is not well understood. Here we show that the proneural protein neurogenin 2 (Neurog2), which controls neurogenesis in the embryonic cerebral cortex, directly induces the expression of the small GTP-binding protein Rnd2 (ref. 3) in newly generated mouse cortical neurons before they initiate migration. Rnd2 silencing leads to a defect in radial migration of cortical neurons similar to that observed when the Neurog2 gene is deleted. Remarkably, restoring Rnd2 expression in Neurog2-mutant neurons is sufficient to rescue their ability to migrate. Our results identify Rnd2 as a novel essential regulator of neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex and demonstrate that Rnd2 is a major effector of Neurog2 function in the promotion of migration. Thus, a proneural protein controls the complex cellular behaviour of cell migration through a remarkably direct pathway involving the transcriptional activation of a small GTP-binding protein.
The areas of the brain that mediate knowledge about objects were investigated by measuring changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using positron emission tomography (PET). Subjects generated words denoting colors and actions associated with static, achromatic line drawings of objects in one experiment, and with the written names of objects in a second experiment. In both studies, generation of color words selectively activated a region in the ventral temporal lobe just anterior to the area involved in the perception of color, whereas generation of action words activated a region in the middle temporal gyrus just anterior to the area involved in the perception of motion. These data suggest that object knowledge is organized as a distributed system in which the attributes of an object are stored close to the regions of the cortex that mediate perception of those attributes.
Although the H2 subclass of histamine receptor has been revealed by classical pharmacological approaches, the direct identification of this adenylate cyclase-linked receptor has, despite much effort, remained elusive. Initial studies using 3H-metiamide and 3H-histamine and, subsequently, work from our own laboratory and others using 3H-cimetidine and 3H-ranitidine in various tissues, has shown the unsuitability of these ligands for labelling the H2 receptor. We report here our results using 3H-tiotidine, a more potent H2-antagonist than either cimetidine or ranitidine, and show that this ligand meets the criteria for labeling the H2 receptor in guinea pig cerebral cortex membranes.
Ovariectomized adult female canaries were treated with physiological doses of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or estradiol. Singing, which is typical of males, occurred in the testosterone-treated birds but not in any of the other birds. The effect of these hormones was assessed on dendrites from a class of neurons in the nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA), a forebrain nucleus for song control. The RA neurons of the testosterone-treated birds had dendritic trees resembling those of intact males. The RA neurons of the estradiol- and dihydrotesterone-treated birds resembled those of intact females. All hormone-treated groups had dendrites that were significantly longer than those of untreated ovariectomized females. Thus gonadal hormones induce dendritic growth in the adult avian brain.
Markedly elevated nighttime concentrations of serotonin in rhesus monkey cerebrospinal fluid were reduced to daytime levels by exposing the monkeys to continuous light or to the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Nighttime elevations of melatonin in cerebrospinal fluid were also suppressed by propranolol and light. Serotonin released in large quantities at night appears to be regulated like melatonin, and may act as a cerebroventricular hormone to influence brain and pituitary function at night.
Mouse spinal neurons grown in tissue culture were used to study the membrane effects of the benzodiazepine flurazepam and the naturally occurring purine nucleoside inosine, which competes for benzodiazepine receptor sites in the central nervous system. Application of inosine elicited two types of transmitter-like membrane effects: a rapidly desensitizing excitatory response and a nondesensitizing inhibitory response. Flurazepam produced a similar excitatory response which showed cross-desensitization with the purine excitation. Flurazepam also blocked the inhibitory inosine response. The results provide electrophysiological evidence that an endogenous purine can activate two different conductances on spinal neurons and that flurazepam can activate one of the conductances and antagonize the other.
The vesicles that package neurotransmitters fall into two distinct classes, large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) and small synaptic vesicles, the coexistence of which is widespread in nerve terminals. High resolution capacitance recording reveals unitary steps proportional to vesicle size. Measurements of capacitance steps during LDCV and secretory granule fusion in endocrine and immune cells have provided important insights into exocytosis; however, extending these measurements to small synaptic vesicles has proven difficult. Here we report single vesicle capacitance steps in posterior pituitary nerve terminals. These nerve terminals contain neuropeptide-laden LDCVs, as well as microvesicles. Microvesicles are similar to synaptic vesicles in size, morphology and molecular composition, but their contents are unknown. Capacitance steps of two characteristic sizes, corresponding with microvesicles and LDCVs, were detected in patches of nerve terminal membrane. Both types of vesicles fuse in response to depolarization-induced Ca(2+) entry. Both undergo a reversible fusion process commonly referred to as 'kiss-and-run', but only rarely. Fusion pores seen during microvesicle kiss-and-run have a conductance of 19 pS, 11 times smaller than LDCV fusion pores. Thus, LDCVs and microvesicles use structurally different intermediates during exocytosis.
The recent positional cloning of the mouse ob gene and its human homology has provided the basis to investigate the potential role of the ob gene product in body weight regulation. A biologically active form of recombinant mouse OB protein was overexpressed and purified to near homogeneity from a bacterial expression system. Peripheral and central administration of microgram doses of OB protein reduced food intake and body weight of ob/ob and diet-induced obese mice but not in db/db obese mice. The behavioral effects after brain administration suggest that OB protein can act directly on neuronal networks that control feeding and energy balance.
There is considerable debate about whether the early processing of sounds depends on whether they form part of speech. Proponents of such speech specificity postulate the existence of language-dependent memory traces, which are activated in the processing of speech but not when equally complex, acoustic non-speech stimuli are processed. Here we report the existence of these traces in the human brain. We presented to Finnish subjects the Finnish phoneme prototype /e/ as the frequent stimulus, and other Finnish phoneme prototypes or a non-prototype (the Estonian prototype /o/) as the infrequent stimulus. We found that the brain's automatic change-detection response, reflected electrically as the mismatch negativity (MMN), was enhanced when the infrequent, deviant stimulus was a prototype (the Finnish /o/) relative to when it was a non-prototype (the Estonian /o/). These phonemic traces, revealed by MMN, are language-specific, as /o/ caused enhancement of MMN in Estonians. Whole-head magnetic recordings located the source of this native-language, phoneme-related response enhancement, and thus the language-specific memory traces, in the auditory cortex of the left hemisphere.
In the adult brain, cortical neurones that project to other cortical areas have traditionally been classified as either "associational' (having connections with the ipsilateral hemisphere) or "callosal' (projecting to areas in the contralateral hemisphere). Using double-labelling with fluorescent dyes, we have now identified a novel category of mature cortical neurone that has both an "associational' and a "callosal' axon. Such neurones can direct their callosal axons either to a cytoarchitectonic area homotopic to the one in which their cell bodies reside or to an entirely different heterotopic region in the contralateral hemisphere. These cortical neurones with divergent axon collaterals in the adult neocortex differ from recently described neurones that have two axons only transiently during development.
Neurotransmitter release at many central synapses is initiated by an influx of calcium ions through P/Q-type calcium channels, which are densely localized in nerve terminals. Because neurotransmitter release is proportional to the fourth power of calcium concentration, regulation of its entry can profoundly influence neurotransmission. N- and P/Q-type calcium channels are inhibited by G proteins, and recent evidence indicates feedback regulation of P/Q-type channels by calcium. Although calcium-dependent inactivation of L-type channels is well documented, little is known about how calcium modulates P/Q-type channels. Here we report a calcium-dependent interaction between calmodulin and a novel site in the carboxy-terminal domain of the alpha1A subunit of P/Q-type channels. In the presence of low concentrations of intracellular calcium chelators, calcium influx through P/Q-type channels enhances channel inactivation, increases recovery from inactivation and produces a long-lasting facilitation of the calcium current. These effects are prevented by overexpression of a calmodulin-binding inhibitor peptide and by deletion of the calmodulin-binding domain. Our results reveal an unexpected association of Ca2+/calmodulin with P/Q-type calcium channels that may contribute to calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity.
This article summarizes methods for the synthesis of phosphorodithioate-linked deoxyoligonucleotides and details an analysis of one of the distinctive properties of phosphorodithioate DNA oligomers, their ability to strongly inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT). Mechanistic studies indicate that oligomers of this type interfere with enzyme function by binding tightly to the active site for primer-template, which results in low or subnanomolar inhibitory constants. Although many of these studies have used deoxyoligocytidine analogs, a rationally designed approach has led to the discovery of a very active phosphorodithioate deoxyoligonucleotide inhibitor. This type of inhibitor, which binds strongly to the primer-template active site of HIV-1 RT, provides another type of potential therapeutic agent against HIV-1.
The runners-up for 2007's Breakthrough of the Year include advances in cellular and structural biology, astrophysics, physics, immunology, synthetic chemistry, neuroscience, and computer science.
Thirty-one metal salts have been tested for their ability to affect the accuracy of DNA synthesis in vitro. All ten salts of metal carcinogens decreased the fidelity of DNA synthesis. Of the three metals which beforehand were considered to be possible mutagens or carcinogens, only one decreased fidelity. In contrast, 17 noncarcinogenic metal salts did not affect fidelity even when present at concentrations that were clearly inhibitory.
That animals and humans can accomplish the same goal using different effectors and different goals using the same effectors attests to the remarkable flexibility of the central nervous system. This phenomenon has been termed 'motor equivalence', an example being the writing of a name with a pencil held between the toes or teeth. The idea of motor equivalence has reappeared because single-cell studies in monkeys have shown that parameters of voluntary movement (such as direction) may be specified in the brain, relegating muscle activation to spinal interneuronal systems. Using a novel experimental paradigms and a full-head SQUID (for superconducting quantum interference device) array to record magnetic fields corresponding to ongoing brain activity, we demonstrate: (1), a robust relationship between time-dependent activity in sensorimotor cortex and movement velocity, independent of explicit task requirements; and (2) neural activations that are specific to task demands alone. It appears, therefore, that signatures of motor equivalence in humans may be found in dynamic patterns of cortical activity.
Many pathological processes, including those causing allergies and autoimmune diseases, are associated with the presence of specialized subsets of T helper cells (TH1 and TH2) at the site of inflammation. The diversity of TH1 and TH2 function is not predetermined but depends on signals that drive the cells towards either subset. Histamine, released from effector cells (mast cells and basophils) during inflammatory reactions can influence immune response. Here we report that histamine enhances TH1-type responses by triggering the histamine receptor type 1 (H1R), whereas both TH1- and TH2-type responses are negatively regulated by H2R through the activation of different biochemical intracellular signals. In mice, deletion of H1R results in suppression of interferon (IFN)-gamma and dominant secretion of TH2 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13). Mutant mice lacking H2R showed upregulation of both TH1 and TH2 cytokines. Relevant to T-cell cytokine profiles, mice lacking H1R displayed increased specific antibody response with increased immunoglobulin-epsilon (IgE) and IgG1, IgG2b and IgG3 compared with mice lacking H2R. These findings account for an important regulatory mechanism in the control of inflammatory functions through effector-cell-derived histamine.
Axonal growth, guidance and synapse formation are controlled by receptors on neuronal growth cones that can recognize positive and inhibitory cues in the local microenvironment. Four well characterized receptor systems are known that recognize the growth-promoting activities associated with the extracellular matrix and the membranes of cells such as astrocytes, muscle cells and Schwann cells; these are the integrins and the homophilically binding cell adhesion molecules neural-cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), N-cadherin and L1 (refs 5-12). Alternative splicing generates 20-30 isoforms of NCAM and these can also be differentially glycosylated. There are two sites where alternative splicing changes the extracellular structure of membrane-bound NCAM and one of these (the MSD1 region) does not obviously affect function. Here we report that the variable alternatively spliced exon (VASE) in immunoglobulin domain 4 downregulates the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of NCAM. The high level of VASE expression in the adult central as compared with peripheral nervous system could contribute to the poor regenerative capacity of the former.
Spinal cord damage in neonatal cats has different effects on different spinal pathways. Corticospinal projections exhibit anatomical plasticity, forming an aberrant pathway that bypasses the lesion. In contrast, brainstem-spinal pathways undergo massive retrograde degeneration. Neither of these responses occurs in adult cats. Sparing of motor function is found in cats operated on as neonates but not in cats operated on as adults, and appears to depend on the plasticity of the corticospinal tract.
Six isolated canine brains were successfully transplanted for 6 hours to 2 days to the cervical vasculature of dogs. Viability was shown by electrocortical activity and significant uptakes of oxygen and glucose, with production of carbon dioxide. Cerebral blood flows, temperatures, and pressures of the cerebral homograft were continuously monitored by way of an implantable recording module.
Peptide hormones, like neurotransmitters, are traditionally thought to activate cells by interacting with receptor sites accessible only from the extracellular space. However, there is no available evidence that establishes whether intracellular injections of peptide secretagogues can or cannot initiate cell activation. In view of recent demonstration that peptide hormones can penetrate the intracellular space in some tissues and the reports that intracellular injections of the neurotransmitter, dopamine, into acinar cells of cockroach salivary gland cause stimulation it seems of fundamental importance to test directly whether introduction of peptide secretagogues inside acinar cells of mammalian exocrine tissue can induce cell activation without first interacting with the outer surface of the external cell membrane. The data presented here show that injections of the secretagogue peptides caerulein and bombesinnonapeptide (bombesin-NP) into pancreatic acinar cells fail to evoke the characteristic potential and conductance changes that are observed following extracellular applications of these peptides.
During stress, the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is changed in a global fashion, leading to an increase in cardiovascular function and a release of adrenal catecholamines. This response is thought to be regulated by a common set of brain neurons that provide a dual input to the sympathetic preganglionic neurons regulating cardiac and adrenal medullary functions. By using a double-virus transneuronal labeling technique, the existence of such a set of central autonomic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem was demonstrated. These neurons innervate both of the sympathetic outflow systems and likely function in circumstances where parallel sympathetic processing occurs, such as in the fight-or-flight response.
Vasoactive intestinal peptide caused a prompt, dose-dependent relaxation of isolated gastric smooth muscle cells of the guinea pig and a significant increase in intracellular adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate coincidentally with optimum relaxation. Relaxation was augmented by a threshold concentration of isobutyl methylxanthine. The direct relaxant effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide and the distribution of nerves containing this peptide to circular smooth muscle support the view that vasoactive intestinal peptide is the neuromuscular transmitter of enteric inhibitory nerves.
Plasticity in neural circuits can result from alterations in synaptic strength or connectivity, as well as from changes in the excitability of the neurons themselves. To better understand the role of plasticity in the brain, we need to establish how brain circuits work and the kinds of computations that different circuit structures achieve. By linking theoretical and experimental studies, we are beginning to reveal the consequences of plasticity mechanisms for network dynamics, in both simple invertebrate circuits and the complex circuits of mammalian cerebral cortex.
The gene encoding p120-rasGAP, a negative regulator of Ras, has been disrupted in mice. This Gap mutation affects the ability of endothelial cells to organize into a highly vascularized network and results in extensive neuronal cell death. Mutati ons in the Gap and Nf1 genes have a synergistic effect, such that embryos homozygous for mutations in both genes show an exacerbated Gap phenotype. Thus rasGAP and neurofibromin act together to regulate Ras activity during embryonic development.
Polycystic kidney diseases (PKDs) are primarily characterized by the growth of fluid-filled cysts in renal tubules leading to end-stage renal disease. Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes lead to autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), a slowly developing adult form. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease results from mutations in the PKHD1 gene, affects newborn infants and progresses very rapidly. No effective treatment is currently available for PKD. A previously unrecognized site of subcellular localization was recently discovered for all proteins known to be disrupted in PKD: primary cilia. Because ciliary functions seem to be involved in cell cycle regulation, disruption of proteins associated with cilia or centrioles may directly affect the cell cycle and proliferation, resulting in cystic disease. We therefore reasoned that the dysregulated cell cycle may be the most proximal cause of cystogenesis, and that intervention targeted at this point could provide significant therapeutic benefit for PKD. Here we show that treatment with the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor (R)-roscovitine does indeed yield effective arrest of cystic disease in jck and cpk mouse models of PKD. Continuous daily administration of the drug is not required to achieve efficacy; pulse treatment provides a robust, long-lasting effect, indicating potential clinical benefits for a lifelong therapy. Molecular studies of the mechanism of action reveal effective cell-cycle arrest, transcriptional inhibition and attenuation of apoptosis. We found that roscovitine is active against cysts originating from different parts of the nephron, a desirable feature for the treatment of ADPKD, in which cysts form in multiple nephron segments. Our results indicate that inhibition of CDK is a new and effective approach to the treatment of PKD.
N-type calcium channels are thought to be expressed specifically in neuronal cells and to have a dominant role in the control of neurotransmitter release from sympathetic neurons. But their unitary properties are poorly understood and the separation of neuronal Ca2+ current into components carried by N-type or L-type Ca2+ channels is controversial. Here we show that individual N-type Ca2+ channels in sympathetic neurons can carry two kinetically distinct components of current, one that is rapidly transient and one that is long lasting. The mechanism that gives rise to these two components is unexpected for Ca2+ channels: a test depolarization elicits either a rapidly inactivating, single short burst with an average duration of 40 ms, or sustained, noninactivating channel activity lasting for over 1 s. The switching between inactivating and noninactivating activity is a slow process, the occurrence of each type of unitary kinetic behaviour remaining statistically correlated over several seconds. Variable coupling of inactivation in N-type Ca2+ channels could be an effective mechanism for the modulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity.
Drosophila thoracic mechanosensory bristles originate from cells that are singled out from 'proneural' groups of competent epithelial cells. Neural competence is restricted to individual sensory organ precursors (SOPs) by Delta/Notch-mediated 'lateral inhibition', whereas other cells in the proneural field adopt an epidermal fate. The precursors of the large macrochaetes differentiate separately from individual proneural clusters that comprise about 20-30 cells or as heterochronic pairs from groups of more than 100 cells, whereas the precursors of the small regularly spaced microchaetes emerge from even larger proneural fields. This indicates that lateral inhibition might act over several cell diameters; it was difficult to reconcile with the fact that the inhibitory ligand Delta is membrane-bound until the observation that SOPs frequently extend thin processes offered an attractive hypothesis. Here we show that the extension of these planar filopodia--a common attribute of wing imaginal disc cells--is promoted by Delta and that their experimental suppression reduces Notch signalling in distant cells and increases bristle density in large proneural groups, showing that these membrane specializations mediate long-range lateral inhibition.
Inhibin is a gonadal glycoprotein hormone that regulates the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the anterior pituitary gland and exhibits intragonadal actions as well. The present study shows that inhibin-like immunoreactivity (inhibin-LI) is present in cells of the cytotrophoblast layer of human placenta at term and in primary cultures of human trophoblasts. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulated secretion of inhibin-LI from these cultured placental cells. This effect was mimicked by 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-bromo-cAMP), forskolin, and cholera toxin, suggesting that the mechanism of hCG induction of placental inhibin-LI secretion is cAMP-dependent. Incubation with an antiserum that binds the alpha-subunit of human inhibin increased the secretion of hCG and gonadotropin-releasing hormone-like immunoreactivity (GnRH-LI) from trophoblast cells in culture, suggesting a local tonic inhibitory action of endogenous inhibin on hCG and GnRH-LI release. The action of inhibin on hCG secretion may partially require the presence of placental GnRH, as suggested by evidence that a synthetic GnRH antagonist partially reverses the hCG increase induced by inhibin immunoneutralization. Results suggest paracrine roles for both inhibin and GnRH in the regulation of placental hCG production.
Electrolytic lesions in a circumscribed area of the rostral midbrain of rats shortened the inhibitory period following ejaculation, thereby increasing the number of ejaculations achieved in 1-hour tests. These lesions also interrupted the dorsal norepinephrine bundle as reflected in a 63 percent reduction in telencephalic or cortical norepinephrine.
The complete inability to sense pain in an otherwise healthy individual is a very rare phenotype. In three consanguineous families from northern Pakistan, we mapped the condition as an autosomal-recessive trait to chromosome 2q24.3. This region contains the gene SCN9A, encoding the alpha-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, Na(v)1.7, which is strongly expressed in nociceptive neurons. Sequence analysis of SCN9A in affected individuals revealed three distinct homozygous nonsense mutations (S459X, I767X and W897X). We show that these mutations cause loss of function of Na(v)1.7 by co-expression of wild-type or mutant human Na(v)1.7 with sodium channel beta(1) and beta(2) subunits in HEK293 cells. In cells expressing mutant Na(v)1.7, the currents were no greater than background. Our data suggest that SCN9A is an essential and non-redundant requirement for nociception in humans. These findings should stimulate the search for novel analgesics that selectively target this sodium channel subunit.
Uptake into glial cells helps to terminate glutamate's neurotransmitter action and to keep its extracellular concentration, [Glu]o, below neurotoxic levels. The accumulative power of the uptake carrier stems from its transport of inorganic ions such as sodium (into the cell) and potassium (out of the cell). There is controversy over whether the carrier also transports a proton (or pH-changing anion). Here we show that the carrier generates an alkalinization outside and an acidification inside glial cells, and transports anions out of the cells, suggesting that there is a carrier cycle in which two Na+ accompany each glutamate anion into the cell, while one K+ and one OH- (or HCO3-) are transported out. This stoichiometry predicts a minimum [Glu]o of 0.6 microM normally (tonically activating presynaptic autoreceptors and post-synaptic NMDA receptors), and 370 microM during brain anoxia (high enough to kill neurons). Transport of OH-/HCO3- on the uptake carrier generates significant pH changes, and may provide a mechanism for neuron-glial interaction.
Slow muscarinic inhibition may be a powerful influence on membrane properties in the peripheral and central nervous system. But the location of the muscarinic receptors in sympathetic ganglia, either on interneurones or on the postganglionic membrane, and the underlying mechanism of the inhibitory response, remains controversial. In mammalian sympathetic ganglia synaptic activation of muscarinic receptors located on inhibitory interneurones was thought to release catecholamines leading to a membrane hyperpolarization called the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential, or s.-i.p.s.p.. However, the s.-i.p.s.p. in parasympathetic ganglia and in amphibian sympathetic ganglia is due to direct monosynaptic activation of muscarinic receptors, accompanied by an increased potassium conductance (but see ref. 11), and is not mediated by catecholamines. The situation is less clear in mammalian sympathetic ganglia and monosynaptic s.-i.p.s.ps observed in other ganglia could be exceptions to the hypothesis. We showed earlier that the s.-i.p.s.p. in rabbit superior cervical ganglia is not affected by catecholamine antagonists. We now show that the s.-i.p.s.p. in a mammalian sympathetic ganglion is due to the monosynaptic activation of muscarinic receptors, probably by an increase in potassium conductance.
Ribonuclease inhibitor is a cytoplasmic protein that tightly binds and inhibits ribonucleases of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily. The primary sequence of this inhibitor contains leucine-rich repeats (LRRs); these motifs are present in many proteins that participate in protein-protein interactions and have different functions and cellular locations. In vivo, ribonuclease inhibitor may have a role in the regulation of RNA turnover in mammalian cells and in angiogenesis. To define the structural features of LRR proteins and to understand better the nature of the tight interaction of ribonuclease inhibitor with ribonucleases, we have determined the crystal structure of the porcine inhibitor. To our knowledge, this is the first three-dimensional structure of a protein containing LRRs and represents a new class of alpha/beta protein fold. Individual repeats constitute beta-alpha structural units that probably also occur in other proteins containing LRRs. The non-globular shape of the structure and the exposed face of the parallel beta-sheet may explain why LRRs are used to achieve strong protein-protein interactions. A possible ribonuclease-binding region incorporates the surface formed by the parallel beta-sheet and the beta alpha loops.
The adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis and in sporadic colorectal tumors, and its product binds to the adherens junction protein beta-catenin. Overexpression of APC blocks cell cycle progression. The APC-beta-catenin complex was shown to bind to DLG, the human homolog of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein. This interaction required the carboxyl-terminal region of APC and the DLG homology repeat region of DLG. APC colocalized with DLG at the lateral cytoplasm in rat colon epithelial cells and at the synapse in cultured hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that the APC-DLG complex may participate in regulation of both cell cycle progression and neuronal function.
Intense rapid eye movements (REM) during sleep were investigated as a possible indication of delay in the neurodevelopment of infants. The rate of occurrence of REM storms was determined by monitoring the sleep of 15 normal, first-born infants during weeks 2 through 5 and at 3, 6, 12 months. The amount of REM within each 10-second interval of active sleep was rated on a four-point scale based on frequency and intensity of eye movements. When the babies were 12 months old, the Bayley Scales of Mental Development were administered. A significant negative correlation was found between the frequency of REM storms of 14 subjects was also studied. The negative correlation was confirmed. The findings support the suggestion that by 6 months of age REM storms express dysfunction or delay in the development of central inhibitory feedback controls for sleep organization and phasic sleep-related activities.
The peak concentration and rate of clearance of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft are important determinants of synaptic function, yet the neurotransmitter concentration time course is unknown at synapses in the brain. The time course of free glutamate in the cleft was estimated by kinetic analysis of the displacement of a rapidly dissociating competitive antagonist from N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors during synaptic transmission. Glutamate peaked at 1.1 millimolar and decayed with a time constant of 1.2 milliseconds at cultured hippocampal synapses. This time course implies that transmitter saturates postsynaptic NMDA receptors. However, glutamate dissociates much more rapidly from alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Thus, the time course of free glutamate predicts that dissociation contributes to the decay of the AMPA receptor-mediated postsynaptic current.
A fish of the genus Eigenmannia responds differently to a neighboring conspecific fish with a slightly higher frequency of the electric organ discharge than its own than to one with a slightly lower such frequency than its own. When the two frequencies are beating against each other the special wave shape of the electric organ discharge leads to asymmetries of the beat pattern which are distinct for the two cases. Midbrain neurons, called "deltaF recoders," sign and magnitude of the frequency difference on the basis of these patterns. that is, in the time rather than the frequency domain.
The cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) integrates signals into mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to maintain pluripotency. Although the Jak-Stat3 pathway is essential and sufficient to mediate LIF signals, it is still unclear how these signals are linked to the core circuitry of pluripotency-associated transcription factors, consisting of Oct3/4 (also called Pou5f1), Sox2 and Nanog. Here we show that two LIF signalling pathways are each connected to the core circuitry via different transcription factors. In mouse ES cells, Klf4 is mainly activated by the Jak-Stat3 pathway and preferentially activates Sox2, whereas Tbx3 is preferentially regulated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and predominantly stimulates Nanog. In the absence of LIF, artificial expression of Klf4 or Tbx3 is sufficient to maintain pluripotency while maintaining the expression of Oct3/4. Notably, overexpression of Nanog supports LIF-independent self-renewal of mouse ES cells in the absence of Klf4 and Tbx3 activity. Therefore, Klf4 and Tbx3 are involved in mediating LIF signalling to the core circuitry but are not directly associated with the maintenance of pluripotency, because ES cells keep pluripotency without their expression in the particular context.
The guinea-pig perfused isolated lung, used in conjunction with the cascade superfusion system to measure the release of thromboxane A2(TXA2), is a simple and convenient model for assessing the inhibition by glucocorticoids of eicosanoid formation. Dexamethasone inhibits the release of TXA2 from the lung when it is stimulated by agents such as RCS-RF2 of leukotrienes, but not when bradykinin or arachidonic acid are used. Using this model we have shown that the glucocorticoids suppress eicosanoid generation by cells through the induction of a family of phospholipase A2-inhibitory proteins now termed the 'lipocortins'. Recently the primary structure of one form of lipocortin has been elucidated and the human gene cloned. Lipocortin 1 is a polar monomeric protein with anti-phospholipase properties in vitro and we now report that when infused into guinea-pig lung preparations this protein has the same inhibitory profile as the glucocorticoids but with a more rapid onset of action. This is the first demonstration that eicosanoid formation can be inhibited by a recombinant phospholipase inhibitory protein applied extracellularly.
A sudden enhancement in virulence of a mild Plasmodium berghei yoelii 17 x strain resulted in fulminating and fatal infections in CF1 and A/J mice. The virulent strain has maintained its characteristics after ten cyclical transmissions through Anopheles stephensi. The visible expression of virulence of the mutated strain is its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause intravascular sequestration of injected erythrocytes and blockage of brain capillaries. We, therfore, believe that the virulent line of Plasmodium berghei yoelii 17 x could serve as a useful laboratory model for the study of "cerebral malaria."
Administration of haloperidol, a common neuroleptic, to pregnant or lactating rats impaired the masculine sex behavior of their male offspring. Prenatal haloperidol did not affect testosterone concentrations in fetuses. Maternal administration of apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, and of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis, also demasculinized male offspring. In both experiments other behaviors and developmental milestones were unaffected. Perinatal haloperidol, apomorphine, and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine did not lower testosterone in adulthood. These drugs may act directly on neurons that control masculine behavior without lowering testosterone prenatally or in adulthood.
Identified goldfish medullary interneurons previously shown to inhibit the Mauthner cell electrically also produce a classical postsynaptic inhibition of that cell. Failure of active spike propagation in the processes of these interneurons underlies generation of the electrical component, and the resultant electrotonic terminal depolarization is sufficient to evoke inhibitory transmitter release.
Many hormones interact with receptors which stimulate the enzyme adenylate cyclase. Less well characterized ar those receptors which mediate an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. However, guanine nucleotides are clearly important in the regulation of both stimulatory and inhibitory receptors. Monovalent cations, notably Na+, regulate many inhibitory receptor systems but apparently not stimulatory receptors. We investigate here the effects of Na+ and guanine nucleotides on the adenylate cyclase-coupled inhibitory alpha 2-adrenergic receptor of the rabbit platelet. Computer modelling of adrenaline competition curves with 3H-dihydroergocryptine (3H-DHE) indicates that adrenaline induces two distinct affinity states of the alpha 2 receptor--one of higher (alpha 2H) and the other of lower (alpha 2L) affinity. Guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) seems to reduce adrenaline affinity to converting the high-affinity state into the low-affinity form of the receptor. In contrast, Na+ reduces adrenaline affinity at both the high- and low-affinity states of the alpha 2 receptor while preserving receptor heterogeneity. Thus, guanine nucleotides and Na+ differ in the manner by which each reduces agonist affinity for the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor.
Calcium is believed to control a variety of cellular processes, often with a high degree of spatial and temporal precision. For a cell to use Ca2+ in this manner, mechanisms must exist for controlling the ion in a localized fashion. We have now gained insight into such mechanisms from studies which measured Ca2+ in single living cells with high resolution using a digital imaging microscope and the highly fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fura-2. Levels of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm, nucleus and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) are clearly different. Free [Ca2+] in the nucleus and SR was greater than in the cytoplasm and these gradients were abolished by Ca2+ ionophores. When external Ca2+ was raised above normal in the absence of ionophores, free cytoplasmic Ca2+ increased but nuclear Ca2+ did not. Thus, nuclear [Ca2+] appears to be regulated independently of cytoplasmic [Ca2+] by gating mechanisms in the nuclear envelope. The observed regulation of intranuclear Ca2+ in these contractile cells may thus be seen as a way to prevent fluctuation in Ca2+-linked nuclear processes during the rise in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] which triggers contraction. The approach described here offers the opportunity of following changes in Ca2+ in cellular compartments in response to a wide range of stimuli, allowing new insights into the role of local changes in Ca2+ in the regulation of cell function.
The small ubiquitin-like modifier protein (SUMO) regulates transcriptional activity and the translocation of proteins across the nuclear membrane. The identification of SUMO substrates outside the nucleus is progressing but little is yet known about the wider cellular role of protein SUMOylation. Here we report that in rat hippocampal neurons multiple SUMOylation targets are present at synapses and we show that the kainate receptor subunit GluR6 is a SUMO substrate. SUMOylation of GluR6 regulates endocytosis of the kainate receptor and modifies synaptic transmission. GluR6 exhibits low levels of SUMOylation under resting conditions and is rapidly SUMOylated in response to a kainate but not an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) treatment. Reducing GluR6 SUMOylation using the SUMO-specific isopeptidase SENP-1 prevents kainate-evoked endocytosis of the kainate receptor. Furthermore, a mutated non-SUMOylatable form of GluR6 is not endocytosed in response to kainate in COS-7 cells. Consistent with this, electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices demonstrate that kainate-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents are decreased by SUMOylation and enhanced by deSUMOylation. These data reveal a previously unsuspected role for SUMO in the regulation of synaptic function.
Transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins are cation-selective channels that function in processes as diverse as sensation and vasoregulation. Mammalian TRP channels that are gated by heat and capsaicin (>43 degrees C; TRPV1 (ref. 1)), noxious heat (>52 degrees C; TRPV2 (ref. 2)), and cooling (< 22 degrees C; TRPM8 (refs 3, 4)) have been cloned; however, little is known about the molecular determinants of temperature sensing in the range between approximately 22 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Here we have identified a member of the vanilloid channel family, human TRPV3 (hTRPV3) that is expressed in skin, tongue, dorsal root ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, spinal cord and brain. Increasing temperature from 22 degrees C to 40 degrees C in mammalian cells transfected with hTRPV3 elevated intracellular calcium by activating a nonselective cationic conductance. As in published recordings from sensory neurons, the current was steeply dependent on temperature, sensitized with repeated heating, and displayed a marked hysteresis on heating and cooling. On the basis of these properties, we propose that hTRPV3 is thermosensitive in the physiological range of temperatures between TRPM8 and TRPV1.
Many neurotransmitters, hormones and growth factors act at membrane receptors to stimulate the phosphodiesteratic hydrolysis of phosphatidyl-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate generating the comessengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol stimulates protein kinase C3 while Ins(1,4,5)P3 is postulated to activate specific receptors leading to release of intracellular calcium, probably from the endoplasmic reticulum. In recent preliminary reports, Rubin and associates detected 32P-Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to liver and adrenal microsomes and to permeabilized neutrophils and liver cells. We now report the biochemical and autoradiographic demonstration in brain of high affinity, selective binding sites for 3H- and 32P-labelled Ins(1,4,5)P3 at levels 100-300 times higher than those observed in peripheral tissues. The potencies of various myoinositol analogues at the Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding site correspond to their potencies in releasing calcium from microsomes, supporting the physiological relevance of this receptor. Brain autoradiograms demonstrate discrete, heterogeneous localization of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors. In some regions localizations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors resemble those of protein kinase C14, while in others they differ markedly, suggesting a novel mechanism whereby the relative activity of the two limbs of the PI cycle can be differently regulated.
AMPA glutamate receptors mediate the majority of rapid excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and play a role in the synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. AMPA receptors are heteromeric complexes of four homologous subunits (GluR1-4) that differentially combine to form a variety of AMPA receptor subtypes. These subunits are thought to have a large extracellular amino-terminal domain, three transmembrane domains and an intracellular carboxy-terminal domain. AMPA receptors are localized at excitatory synapses and are not found on adjacent inhibitory synapses enriched in GABA(A) receptors. The targeting of neurotransmitter receptors, such as AMPA receptors, and ion channels to synapses is essential for efficient transmission. A protein motif called a PDZ domain is important in the targeting of a variety of membrane proteins to cell-cell junctions including synapses. Here we identify a synaptic PDZ domain-containing protein GRIP (glutamate receptor interacting protein) that specifically interacts with the C termini of AMPA receptors. GRIP is a new member of the PDZ domain-containing protein family which has seven PDZ domains and no catalytic domain. GRIP appears to serve as an adapter protein that links AMPA receptors to other proteins and may be critical for the clustering of AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses in the brain.
Puromycin, in dosages that inhibit cerebral protein synthesis and expression of memory in mice, produces swelling of neuronal mitochondria. Acetoxycycloheximide, which inhibits cerebral protein synthesis to the same extent as puromycin, fails to produce swelling of neuronal mitochondria. Puromycin and heximide mixtures produce severe inhibition of protein synthesis, but result in a minimal swelling of neuronal mitochondria and in a decrease of peptidylpuromycin complexes to a level of 30 percent of that following the injection of puromycin alone. It is concluded that swelling of neuronal mitochondria in the presence of puromycin is not due to inhibition of cerebral protein synthesis per se, but is related to a specific action of puromycin on ribosomal protein synthesis. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that peptidyl-puromycin complexes are responsible for mitochondrial swelling.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a therapeutic option for intractable neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease and major depression. Because of the heterogeneity of brain tissues where electrodes are placed, it has been challenging to elucidate the relevant target cell types or underlying mechanisms of DBS. We used optogenetics and solid-state optics to systematically drive or inhibit an array of distinct circuit elements in freely moving parkinsonian rodents and found that therapeutic effects within the subthalamic nucleus can be accounted for by direct selective stimulation of afferent axons projecting to this region. In addition to providing insight into DBS mechanisms, these results demonstrate an optical approach for dissection of disease circuitry and define the technological toolbox needed for systematic deconstruction of disease circuits by selectively controlling individual components.
The receptive fields of single cells in area 5 of monkey parietal cortex were studied by extracellular recording. Cells were driven primarily by gentle manipulation of multiple joints residing on one or more limbs. Both excitatory and inhibitory convergence were demonstrated. It is postulated that the multijoint receptive fields of area 5 are the result of convergence from single-joint cells of the primary receiving area. An analogy is drawn between the modification of information in the visual and somatosensory systems.
Parietal and premotor cortex regions are serious contenders for bringing motor intentions and motor responses into awareness. We used electrical stimulation in seven patients undergoing awake brain surgery. Stimulating the right inferior parietal regions triggered a strong intention and desire to move the contralateral hand, arm, or foot, whereas stimulating the left inferior parietal region provoked the intention to move the lips and to talk. When stimulation intensity was increased in parietal areas, participants believed they had really performed these movements, although no electromyographic activity was detected. Stimulation of the premotor region triggered overt mouth and contralateral limb movements. Yet, patients firmly denied that they had moved. Conscious intention and motor awareness thus arise from increased parietal activity before movement execution.
Many regions of the mammalian brain are characterized by iterated ensembles of nerve cells which can be distinguished anatomically and physiologically. A particularly striking example is the pattern of glomeruli in the olfactory bulbs; other instances are columns and 'blobs' in the visual cortex, barrels and columns in the somatosensory cortex, and striasomes and cell islands in the neostriatum. Understanding the generation of these neuronal ensembles has a bearing on a variety of important neurobiological problems, including the nature of critical periods, the age-dependent response of the nervous system to injury and the manner in which neural information is stored. Analysis of these issues has usually been restricted to studies of the brains of different individuals at various ages. Many questions about the formation of such units, however, can only be answered by observing the same brain repeatedly in a living animal. This strategy would enable a direct assessment of how these units are assembled, whether the initial ensembles persist and whether units are lost or gained as an animal matures. We have succeeded in studying the pattern of glomeruli in the mouse olfactory bulb on two separate occasions during postnatal development. Comparison of the patterns observed at intervals of up to three weeks show that this part of the brain is gradually constructed by the addition of new glomeruli to a persisting population.
The flowering response by plants of Lolium temulentum after exposure to 1 long day was significantly reduced by single applications of abscisin 11 to the leaves or near the shoot apex. The time course of this inhibitory effect suggests that abscisin 11 acts at the shoot apex when the floral stimulus arrives there.
The benefits and costs of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in employment settings are examined from two points of view: that of private employers whose profitability may be affected by their testing policies and that of public policy-makers who may affect social welfare through their design of regulations related to HIV testing. The results reveal that HIV testing is clearly not cost-beneficial for most firms, although the benefits of HIV testing may outweigh the costs for some large firms that offer generous fringe-benefit packages and that recruit workers from populations in which the prevalence of HIV infection is high. The analysis also indicates that the testing decisions of unregulated employers are not likely to yield socially optimal economic outcomes and that existing state and federal legislation related to HIV testing in employment settings has been motivated primarily by concerns over social equity.
Multiplicative operations are important in sensory processing, but their biophysical implementation remains largely unknown. We investigated an identified neuron (the lobula giant movement detector, LGMD, of locusts) whose output firing rate in response to looming visual stimuli has been described by two models, one of which involves a multiplication. In this model, the LGMD multiplies postsynaptically two inputs (one excitatory, one inhibitory) that converge onto its dendritic tree; in the other model, inhibition is presynaptic to the LGMD. By using selective activation and inactivation of pre- and postsynaptic inhibition, we show that postsynaptic inhibition has a predominant role, suggesting that multiplication is implemented within the neuron itself. Our pharmacological experiments and measurements of firing rate versus membrane potential also reveal that sodium channels act both to advance the response of the LGMD in time and to map membrane potential to firing rate in a nearly exponential manner. These results are consistent with an implementation of multiplication based on dendritic subtraction of two converging inputs encoded logarithmically, followed by exponentiation through active membrane conductances.
Among the genes thought to be involved in patterning the nervous system are a family of developmentally regulated paired box-containing (Pax) genes. Mutations in some of these Pax genes lead to severe developmental abnormalities. Zebrafish pax[b](pax[zf-b]) is a member of the Pax gene family that is expressed in the presumptive posterior midbrain from the end of gastrulation and, at later stages, in other localized regions of the developing embryo. Here we show that injection of antibodies raised against the pax[b] protein causes a localized malformation at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. In situ hybridizations demonstrate that antibody injection causes downregulation of pax[b] transcripts in the posterior midbrain and alteration of wnt-1 and eng-2 expression in this area. The data demonstrate an involvement of pax[b] in the formation of the midbrain-hindbrain junction.
Granule neuron precursors (GNPs) are the most actively proliferating cells in the postnatal nervous system, and mutations in pathways that control the GNP cell cycle can result in medulloblastoma. The transcription factor Atoh1 has been suspected to contribute to GNP proliferation, but its role in normal and neoplastic postnatal cerebellar development remains unexplored. We show that Atoh1 regulates the signal transduction pathway of Sonic Hedgehog, an extracellular factor that is essential for GNP proliferation, and demonstrate that deletion of Atoh1 prevents cerebellar neoplasia in a mouse model of medulloblastoma. Our data shed light on the function of Atoh1 in postnatal cerebellar development and identify a new mechanism that can be targeted to regulate medulloblastoma formation.
Sleep is one of the few major whole-organ phenomena for which no function and no underlying mechanism have been conclusively demonstrated. Sleep could result from global changes in the brain during wakefulness or it could be regulated by specific loci that recruit the rest of the brain into the electrical and metabolic states characteristic of sleep. Here we address this issue by exploiting the genetic tractability of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibits the hallmarks of vertebrate sleep. We show that large changes in sleep are achieved by spatial and temporal enhancement of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity specifically in the adult mushroom bodies of Drosophila. Other manipulations of the mushroom bodies, such as electrical silencing, increasing excitation or ablation, also alter sleep. These results link sleep regulation to an anatomical locus known to be involved in learning and memory.
Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) often store more than one neurotransmitter, but as yet the functional significance of this type of coexistence is poorly understood. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) modulates calcium-dependent K+ channels (KCa) responsible for the postspike afterhyperpolarization in different regions of the CNS. In lamprey, 5-HT neurons control apamine-sensitive KCa channels in spinal locomotor network interneurons, thereby in addition regulating the duration of locomotor bursts. We report here that these spinal 5-HT neurons also contain dopamine. Like 5-HT, dopamine causes a reduction of the afterhyperpolarization, but in this case it is due to a reduction of calcium entry during the action potential, which results in a reduced activation of KCa. 5-HT and dopamine are both released from these midline neurons, and both reduce the afterhyperpolarization through two distinctly different, but complementary cellular mechanisms. The net effect of dopamine (10-100 microM) on the locomotor network is similar to that of 5-HT, and the effects of dopamine and 5-HT are additive at the network level.
The role of troponin-I (the inhibitory subunit of troponin) in the regulation by Ca2+ of skeletal muscle contraction was investigated with resonance energy transfer and photo cross-linking techniques. The effect of Ca2+ on the proximity of troponin-I to actin in reconstituted rabbit skeletal thin filaments was determined. The distance between the cysteine residue at position 133 (Cys133) of troponin-I and Cys374 of actin increases by approximately 15 angstroms on binding of Ca2+ to troponin-C. Also, troponin-I labeled at Cys133 with benzophenone-4-maleimide could be photo cross-linked to actin in the absence of Ca2+, but not in its presence. These results suggest that troponin-I is attached to actin in the Ca2(+)-free or relaxed state of muscle, and that it detaches from actin on Ca2+ activation of contraction. Thus, troponin-I may function as a Ca2(+)-dependent molecular switch in regulation of skeletal muscle contraction.
GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory transmitter in the adult brain, and it exerts its fast hyperpolarizing effect through activation of anion (predominantly Cl-)-permeant GABA(A) receptors. However, during early neuronal development, GABA(A)-receptor-mediated responses are often depolarizing, which may be a key factor in the control of several Ca2+-dependent developmental phenomena, including neuronal proliferation, migration and targeting. To date, however, the molecular mechanism underlying this shift in neuronal electrophysiological phenotype is unknown. Here we show that, in pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus, the ontogenetic change in GABA(A)-mediated responses from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing is coupled to a developmental induction of the expression of the neuronal (Cl-)-extruding K+/Cl- co-transporter, KCC2. Antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of KCC2 expression produces a marked positive shift in the reversal potential of GABAA responses in functionally mature hippocampal pyramidal neurons. These data support the conclusion that KCC2 is the main Cl- extruder to promote fast hyperpolarizing postsynaptic inhibition in the brain.
Neurotransmitter release is triggered by an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), but it is unknown whether the Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion is modulated during synaptic plasticity. We investigated whether the potentiation of neurotransmitter release by phorbol esters, which target presynaptic protein kinase C (PKC)/munc-13 signalling cascades, exerts a direct effect on the Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion. Using direct presynaptic Ca2+-manipulation and Ca2+ uncaging at a giant presynaptic terminal, the calyx of Held, we show that phorbol esters potentiate transmitter release by increasing the apparent Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion. Phorbol esters potentiate Ca2+-evoked release as well as the spontaneous release rate. We explain both effects by an increased fusion 'willingness' in a new allosteric model of Ca2+-activation of vesicle fusion. In agreement with an allosteric mechanism, we observe that the classically high Ca2+ cooperativity in triggering vesicle fusion (approximately 4) is gradually reduced below 3 microM [Ca2+]i, reaching a value of <1 at basal [Ca2+]i. Our data indicate that spontaneous transmitter release close to resting [Ca2+]i is a consequence of an intrinsic property of the molecular machinery that mediates synaptic vesicle fusion.
Actions performed by others may have different relevance for the observer, and thus lead to different behavioral responses, depending on the regions of space in which they are executed. We found that in rhesus monkeys, the premotor cortex neurons activated by both the execution and the observation of motor acts (mirror neurons) are differentially modulated by the location in space of the observed motor acts relative to the monkey, with about half of them preferring either the monkey's peripersonal or extrapersonal space. A portion of these spatially selective mirror neurons encode space according to a metric representation, whereas other neurons encode space in operational terms, changing their properties according to the possibility that the monkey will interact with the object. These results suggest that a set of mirror neurons encodes the observed motor acts not only for action understanding, but also to analyze such acts in terms of features that are relevant to generating appropriate behaviors.
Mammals have separate enzymatic and cellularly mediated detoxification systems. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) protect against xenobiotic chemicals which continuously enter the body, largely through mucous membranes. These enzymes catalyse the conjugation of glutathione with a wide variety of electrophilic compounds rendering them non-toxic. Mammals also mount a cellular immunological response on entry of foreign cells, viruses or macromolecules into the body. T lymphocytes mobilize at the site of foreign body entry and secrete protein messengers called lymphokines. Secondary to T lymphocytes, macrophages concentrate at the infection site and function in antigen processing and phagocytosis. In vitro, macrophage movement is arrested by one class of lymphokines known as macrophage migration inhibitory factors (MIFs). We report here the purification of milligram quantities of a unique multifunctional protein from rat liver which links enzymatic and immunological detoxification systems. This protein actuates both GST and MIF activity and matches the primary structure of a human MIF in 25 out of 26 amino-terminal amino acids. Primary structure comparisons revealed significant similarity between GSTs and MIF. The glutathione affinity chromatography purification described here yields a 100-fold increase in obtaining MIF and will aid understanding of its precise biological function.
The systemic administration of either methamphetamine or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to experimental animals produces degenerative changes in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons or their axon terminals. This study was conducted to determine if excitatory amino acids, which appear to be involved in various neurodegenerative disorders, might also contribute to the dopaminergic neurotoxicity produced in mice by either methamphetamine or MPTP. MK-801, phencyclidine, and ketamine, noncompetitive antagonists of one subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, provided substantial protection against neurotoxicity produced by methamphetamine but not that produced by MPTP. These findings indicate that excitatory amino acids play an important role in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic damage induced by methamphetamine.
Rats made phenylketonuric by a diet containing high levels of either phenylalanine alone, or phenylalanine and tyrosine, show a marked reduction in total cerebral stores of serotonin. Evidence from studies both in vitro and in vivo indicates that an important mechanism of this impairment in the metabolism of serotonin is the inhibition by high levels of these amino acids of the active transport of the precursor of serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, into brain.
Modern pain-control theory predicts that a loss of inhibition (disinhibition) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord is a crucial substrate for chronic pain syndromes. However, the nature of the mechanisms that underlie such disinhibition has remained controversial. Here we present evidence for a novel mechanism of disinhibition following peripheral nerve injury. It involves a trans-synaptic reduction in the expression of the potassium-chloride exporter KCC2, and the consequent disruption of anion homeostasis in neurons of lamina I of the superficial dorsal horn, one of the main spinal nociceptive output pathways. In our experiments, the resulting shift in the transmembrane anion gradient caused normally inhibitory anionic synaptic currents to be excitatory, substantially driving up the net excitability of lamina I neurons. Local blockade or knock-down of the spinal KCC2 exporter in intact rats markedly reduced the nociceptive threshold, confirming that the reported disruption of anion homeostasis in lamina I neurons was sufficient to cause neuropathic pain.
The putative excitatory transmitters glutamate and aspartate, as well as their excitatory analogues, can kill neurones in the central nervous system and may thus be involved in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. Several studies have suggested that postsynaptic receptors are important in the mechanism of toxicity. However, presynaptic factors might also be involved because, in some brain areas, the neurotoxicity of kainate (a potent structural analogue of glutamate) is greatly reduced following elimination of afferent excitatory innervation, even though the postsynaptic excitatory potency of kainate may be unaltered in these conditions. The supply of glutamate from the afferent nerve endings has been suggested to be a necessary factor. Recently, Ferkany, Zaczec and Coyle concluded from studies on slices of mouse cerebellum that kainate activates presynaptic kainate receptors on parallel fibre terminals to release glutamate and that it is the postsynaptic interaction between kainate and the released amino acid that is instrumental in causing neuronal necrosis. The more direct evidence we report here does not support these conclusions.
A key issue in signal transduction is how signaling pathways common to many systems-so-called canonical signaling cassettes-integrate signals from molecules having a wide spectrum of activities, such as hormones and neurotrophins, to deliver distinct biological outcomes. The neuroendocrine cell line PC12, derived from rat pheochromocytoma, provides an example of how one canonical signaling cassette-the Raf --> mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) --> extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway-can promote distinct outcomes, which in this case include neuritogenesis, gene induction, and proliferation. Two growth hormones, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), use the same pathway to cause PC12 proliferation and differentiation, respectively. In addition, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neurotransmitter that also causes differentiation, uses the same canonical cassette as NGF but in a different way. The Connections Map for PC12 Cell Differentiation brings into focus the complex array of specific cellular responses that rely on canonical signal transduction systems.
Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a genetically influenced developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by chronic vocal and motor tics. We studied Slit and Trk-like 1 (SLITRK1) as a candidate gene on chromosome 13q31.1 because of its proximity to a de novo chromosomal inversion in a child with TS. Among 174 unrelated probands, we identified a frameshift mutation and two independent occurrences of the identical variant in the binding site for microRNA hsa-miR-189. These variants were absent from 3600 control chromosomes. SLITRK1 mRNA and hsa-miR-189 showed an overlapping expression pattern in brain regions previously implicated in TS. Wild-type SLITRK1, but not the frameshift mutant, enhanced dendritic growth in primary neuronal cultures. Collectively, these findings support the association of rare SLITRK1 sequence variants with TS.
In Drosophila, the Dorsal protein establishes the embryonic dorso-ventral axis during development. Here we show that the vertebrate homologue of Dorsal, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), is vital for the formation of the proximo-distal organizer of the developing limb bud, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Transcription of the NF-kappaB proto-oncogene c-rel is regulated, in part, during morphogenesis of the limb bud by AER-derived signals such as fibroblast growth factors. Interruption of NF-kappaB activity using viral-mediated delivery of an inhibitor results in a highly dysmorphic AER, reduction in overall limb size, loss of distal elements and reversal in the direction of limb outgrowth. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in limb mesenchyme leads to a reduction in expression of Sonic hedgehog and Twist but derepresses expression of the bone morphogenetic protein-4 gene. These results are the first evidence that vertebrate NF-kappaB proteins act to transmit growth factor signals between the ectoderm and the underlying mesenchyme during embryonic limb formation.
Mouse models are useful for studying genes involved in behavior, but whether they are relevant to human behavior is unclear. Here, we identified parallel phenotypes in mice and humans resulting from a common single-nucleotide polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, which is involved in anxiety-related behavior. An inbred genetic knock-in mouse strain expressing the variant BDNF recapitulated the phenotypic effects of the human polymorphism. Both were impaired in extinguishing a conditioned fear response, which was paralleled by atypical frontoamygdala activity in humans. Thus, this variant BDNF allele may play a role in anxiety disorders showing impaired learning of cues that signal safety versus threat and in the efficacy of treatments that rely on extinction mechanisms, such as exposure therapy.
The retinal fovea, which corresponds to the central degree or so of vision, is spatially over-represented in the visual cortex. It is about 0.01% of retina area, but at least 8% of the striate cortex. Does this simply reflect an equivalently uneven distribution of ganglion cells in the retina, or is the cortical representation of the fovea preferentially expanded? The answer hinges on the resolution of long-standing discrepancies between the retinal and cortical magnification factors. We approached the problem in a different way, using a retrograde transneuronal tracer from cortex to retina to relate directly the number of ganglion cells projecting to marked areas of striate cortex. We report here that ganglion cells near the fovea were allocated 3.3 to 5.9 times more cortical tissue than more peripheral ones, and conclude that the cortical representation of the most central retina is much greater than expected from the density of its ganglion cells.
Animals from flies to humans are able to distinguish subtle gradations in temperature and show strong temperature preferences. Animals move to environments of optimal temperature and some manipulate the temperature of their surroundings, as humans do using clothing and shelter. Despite the ubiquitous influence of environmental temperature on animal behaviour, the neural circuits and strategies through which animals select a preferred temperature remain largely unknown. Here we identify a small set of warmth-activated anterior cell (AC) neurons located in the Drosophila brain, the function of which is critical for preferred temperature selection. AC neuron activation occurs just above the fly's preferred temperature and depends on dTrpA1, an ion channel that functions as a molecular sensor of warmth. Flies that selectively express dTrpA1 in the AC neurons select normal temperatures, whereas flies in which dTrpA1 function is reduced or eliminated choose warmer temperatures. This internal warmth-sensing pathway promotes avoidance of slightly elevated temperatures and acts together with a distinct pathway for cold avoidance to set the fly's preferred temperature. Thus, flies select a preferred temperature by using a thermal sensing pathway tuned to trigger avoidance of temperatures that deviate even slightly from the preferred temperature. This provides a potentially general strategy for robustly selecting a narrow temperature range optimal for survival.
The actions of many hormones and neurotransmitters are mediated by the members of a superfamily of receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). These receptors are characterized by a highly conserved topographical arrangement in which seven transmembrane domains are connected by intracellular and extracellular loops. The interaction between these receptors and G proteins is mediated in large part by the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Coexpression of the third intracellular loop of the alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor with its parent receptor inhibited receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C. The inhibition extended to the closely related alpha 1C-adrenergic receptor subtype, but not the phospholipase C-coupled M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor nor the adenylate cyclase-coupled D1A dopamine receptor. These results suggest that the receptor-G protein interface may represent a target for receptor antagonist drugs.
The rapid antidepressant response after ketamine administration in treatment-resistant depressed patients suggests a possible new approach for treating mood disorders compared to the weeks or months required for standard medications. However, the mechanisms underlying this action of ketamine [a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist] have not been identified. We observed that ketamine rapidly activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, leading to increased synaptic signaling proteins and increased number and function of new spine synapses in the prefrontal cortex of rats. Moreover, blockade of mTOR signaling completely blocked ketamine induction of synaptogenesis and behavioral responses in models of depression. Our results demonstrate that these effects of ketamine are opposite to the synaptic deficits that result from exposure to stress and could contribute to the fast antidepressant actions of ketamine.
Recent studies have shown that gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) induces the expression of Ia antigen on astrocytes. This observation is of immunological significance because such activated astrocytes can act as antigen-presenting cells, as demonstrated with myelin basic protein for antigen-specific encephalitogenic T-cell lines. However, the lack of lymphatic drainage in brain and the presence of the so-called blood-brain barrier restricting traffic of cells and macromolecules suggests that IFN-gamma may not be readily available, at least during the initial phases of viral infections. The question therefore arises as to whether astrocytes can be induced to express Ia antigens by other signals directly related to viral infection and possibly independent of IFN-gamma. In the present report we demonstrate that a neurotropic murine hepatitis virus induces expression of Ia antigen on astrocytes in tissue culture without infection, rendering these brain cells competent to participate directly in the immune response to a viral infection.
Two bipolar neurons are located in a nerve branch connecting the recurrent nerve and foregut of the blowfly Phormia regina. Spike activity accompanying peristalsis or controlled enlargement of the foregut region is recorded from two cells in the recurrent nerve. The spikes are abolished by section of the nerve branch connecting recurrent nerve and foregut. It is concluded that the two neurons are the foregut stretch receptors predicted from results of behavioral experiments and vital to the regulation of feeding by the fly.
Apoptosis plays an important role during neuronal development, and defects in apoptosis may underlie various neurodegenerative disorders. To characterize molecular mechanisms that regulate neuronal apoptosis, the contributions to cell death of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family members, including ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase), and p38, were examined after withdrawal of nerve growth factor (NGF) from rat PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. NGF withdrawal led to sustained activation of the JNK and p38 enzymes and inhibition of ERKs. The effects of dominant-interfering or constitutively activated forms of various components of the JNK-p38 and ERK signaling pathways demonstrated that activation of JNK and p38 and concurrent inhibition of ERK are critical for induction of apoptosis in these cells. Therefore, the dynamic balance between growth factor-activated ERK and stress-activated JNK-p38 pathways may be important in determining whether a cell survives or undergoes apoptosis.
Axonal transport studies and biochemical fractionation have led to the concept that the three 'triplet' proteins [approximate molecular weights 200,000 (200K), 145,000 (145K) and 68,000 (68K)] are the essential components of mammalian neurofilaments. Using a correlated biochemical and immunological approach, we have now shown that the 200K protein is under separate developmental control during rat brain differentiation and that the time of its expression differs in different regions. We were unable to detect 200K protein by immunofluorescence or in total brain filament preparations from prenatal rat brain, although the 145K and 68K proteins are both present in an apparently identical distribution. During development, progressively more 145K- and 68K-positive neurofilamentous bundles can be stained with 200K antibodies, paralleling the increasing quantities of this protein detected biochemically in brain filament preparations. We conclude that 200K protein probably has a more specialized role in neurofilament architecture and function than the other two triplet proteins.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) comprises three clinically distinct, dominantly inherited cancer syndromes. MEN 2A patients develop medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and phaeochromocytoma. MEN 2B patients show in addition ganglioneuromas of the gastrointestinal tract and skeletal abnormalities. In familial MTC, only the thyroid is affected. Germ-line mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have recently been reported in association with MEN 2A and familial MTC. All mutations occurred within codons specifying cysteine residues in the transition point between the RET protein extracellular and transmembrane domains. We now show that MEN 2B is also associated with mutation of the RET proto-oncogene. A mutation in codon 664, causing the substitution of a threonine for a methionine in the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein, was found in all nine unrelated MEN 2B patients studied. The same mutation was found in six out of 18 sporadic tumours.
Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase, the enzyme that is apparently rate-limiting in biopterin biosynthesis, is increased in adrenal cortex and medulla of rats treated with insulin or reserpine. Denervation and hypophysectomy block the increase in medullary and cortical enzyme activity, respectively, whereas cycloheximide presents the increase in both tissues. These results provide evidence for induction and regulation of guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase.
Voltage-dependent potassium ion (K+) channels (Kv channels) conduct K+ ions across the cell membrane in response to changes in the membrane voltage, thereby regulating neuronal excitability by modulating the shape and frequency of action potentials. Here we report the crystal structure, at a resolution of 2.9 angstroms, of a mammalian Kv channel, Kv1.2, which is a member of the Shaker K+ channel family. This structure is in complex with an oxido-reductase beta subunit of the kind that can regulate mammalian Kv channels in their native cell environment. The activation gate of the pore is open. Large side portals communicate between the pore and the cytoplasm. Electrostatic properties of the side portals and positions of the T1 domain and beta subunit are consistent with electrophysiological studies of inactivation gating and with the possibility of K+ channel regulation by the beta subunit.
To understand a neural circuit requires knowledge of its connectivity. Here we report measurements of functional connectivity between the input and ouput layers of the macaque retina at single-cell resolution and the implications of these for colour vision. Multi-electrode technology was used to record simultaneously from complete populations of the retinal ganglion cell types (midget, parasol and small bistratified) that transmit high-resolution visual signals to the brain. Fine-grained visual stimulation was used to identify the location, type and strength of the functional input of each cone photoreceptor to each ganglion cell. The populations of ON and OFF midget and parasol cells each sampled the complete population of long- and middle-wavelength-sensitive cones. However, only OFF midget cells frequently received strong input from short-wavelength-sensitive cones. ON and OFF midget cells showed a small non-random tendency to selectively sample from either long- or middle-wavelength-sensitive cones to a degree not explained by clumping in the cone mosaic. These measurements reveal computations in a neural circuit at the elementary resolution of individual neurons.
Alternative splicing has a crucial role in the generation of biological complexity, and its misregulation is often involved in human disease. Here we describe the assembly of a 'splicing code', which uses combinations of hundreds of RNA features to predict tissue-dependent changes in alternative splicing for thousands of exons. The code determines new classes of splicing patterns, identifies distinct regulatory programs in different tissues, and identifies mutation-verified regulatory sequences. Widespread regulatory strategies are revealed, including the use of unexpectedly large combinations of features, the establishment of low exon inclusion levels that are overcome by features in specific tissues, the appearance of features deeper into introns than previously appreciated, and the modulation of splice variant levels by transcript structure characteristics. The code detected a class of exons whose inclusion silences expression in adult tissues by activating nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay, but whose exclusion promotes expression during embryogenesis. The code facilitates the discovery and detailed characterization of regulated alternative splicing events on a genome-wide scale.
The destruction of ascending noradreniergic pathways by bilateral microinjections of 6-hydroxydopamnine made laterally to the pedunculus cerebellaris superior completely abolished the in vitro synthesis of [(3)H]norepinephrine from L-[(3)H]tyrosine in slices and in synaptosomes of the rat cortex. However, normal [(3)H]dopamine synthesis could still be observed in both cortical preparations from animals with lesions. These results provide the first biochemical support for the existence of dopaminergic terminals independent of noradrenergic terminals in the rat cortex.
The tonotopic organization of brainstem auditory nuclei was compared in embryonic and hatchling chickens. In embryos, neurons at any given position in these nuclei were maximally sensitive to lower frequency sounds than the best frequency after hatching. This finding indicates that neurons are maximally stimulated by sounds of different frequencies as development proceeds and supports the hypothesis that during development there is a change in the spatial encoding of frequency along the cochlea.
When different images are presented to the two eyes, they compete for perceptual dominance, such that one image is visible while the other is suppressed. This binocular rivalry is thought to reflect competition between monocular neurons within the primary visual cortex. However, neurons whose activity correlates with perception during rivalry are found mainly in higher cortical areas, and respond to input from both eyes. Thus rivalry may involve competition between alternative perceptual interpretations at a higher level of analysis. To investigate this, we tested the effect of rapidly alternating the rival stimuli between the two eyes. Under these conditions, the perceptual alternations exhibit the same temporal dynamics as with static patterns, and a single phase of perceptual dominance can span multiple alternations of the stimuli. Thus neural representations of the two stimuli compete for visual awareness independently of the eye through which they reach the higher visual areas. This finding places binocular rivalry in the general category of multistable phenomena, such as ambiguous figures, and provides a new way to study the neural cause and resolution of perceptual ambiguities.
The fluorescence of the reduced form of the endogenous pyridine nucleotide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was used to map regions of ischemia in cat brain. A remarkably microheterogeneous pattern of increased fluorescence resulted from a critical level of incomplete cerebral ischemia. The fluorescence pattern suggests that ischemia occurs initially in microwatershed zones between penetrating cerebral arteries.
An ongoing controversy concerns the cellular distribution of the differentially spliced forms of the amyloid protein precursor (APP) mRNAs and changes in prevalence of these transcripts during Alzheimer's disease. In situ hybridization on serial sections was used to prove that most hippocampal pyramidal neurons contain both APP-751 and APP-695 mRNA species. The APP-751/APP-695 mRNA ratio is generally increased during Alzheimer's disease, as shown by RNA gel blot analysis. Moreover, there was a strong linear relation between the increase in APP-751/APP-695 mRNA ratio in pyramidal neurons and the density of senile plaques within the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Thus, the increase in APP-751/APP-695 mRNA provides a molecular marker for regional variations in plaque density between individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by the commonly used composite criteria.
The central biological clock of the mammalian brain is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This hypothalamic region contains neurons that generate a circadian rhythm on a single-cell basis. Clock cells transmit their circadian timing signals to other brain areas by diurnal modulation of their spontaneous firing rate. The intracellular mechanism underlying rhythm generation is thought to consist of one or more self-regulating molecular loops, but it is unknown how these loops interact with the plasma membrane to modulate the ionic conductances that regulate firing behaviour. Here we demonstrate a diurnal modulation of Ca2+ current in suprachiasmatic neurons. This current strongly contributes to the generation of spontaneous oscillations in membrane potential, which occur selectively during daytime and are tightly coupled to spike generation. Thus, day-night modulation of Ca2+ current is a central step in transducing the intracellular cycling of molecular clocks to the rhythm in spontaneous firing rate.
Sensory information is transmitted to the brain where it must be processed to translate stimulus features into appropriate behavioural output. In the olfactory system, distributed neural activity in the nose is converted into a segregated map in the olfactory bulb. Here we investigate how this ordered representation is transformed in higher olfactory centres in mice. We have developed a tracing strategy to define the neural circuits that convey information from individual glomeruli in the olfactory bulb to the piriform cortex and the cortical amygdala. The spatial order in the bulb is discarded in the piriform cortex; axons from individual glomeruli project diffusely to the piriform without apparent spatial preference. In the cortical amygdala, we observe broad patches of projections that are spatially stereotyped for individual glomeruli. These projections to the amygdala are overlapping and afford the opportunity for spatially localized integration of information from multiple glomeruli. The identification of a distributive pattern of projections to the piriform and stereotyped projections to the amygdala provides an anatomical context for the generation of learned and innate behaviours.
There are two major angiotensin II receptor isoforms, AT1 and AT2. AT1 mediates the well-known pressor and mitogenic effects of angiotensin II, but the signalling mechanism and physiological role of AT2 has not been established. Its abundant expression in fetal tissues and certain brain nuclei suggest possible roles in growth, development and neuronal functions. Here we report the unexpected finding that the targeted disruption of the mouse AT2 gene resulted in a significant increase in blood pressure and increased sensitivity to the pressor action of angiotensin II. Thus AT2 mediates a depressor effect and antagonizes the AT1-mediated pressor action of angiotensin II. In addition, disruption of the AT2 gene attenuated exploratory behaviour and lowered body temperature. Our results show that angiotensin II activates AT1 and AT2, which have mutually counteracting haemodynamic effects, and that AT2 regulates central nervous system functions, including behaviour.
Insulin is produced from an inactive precursor, proinsulin, through initial endoproteolytic cleavage at sites marked by pairs of basic amino-acid residues. We report here that lysates of insulin secretory granules contain two distinct Ca-dependent acidic endoproteases; one (type I) cleaving exclusively on the C-terminal side of Arg 31.Arg 32 (B-chain/C-peptide junction), the other (type II) preferentially on the C-terminal side of Lys 64.Arg 65 of proinsulin (C-peptide/A-chain junction). The Ca and pH requirements of these proteinases suggested that the type-II proteinase would be active in the Golgi apparatus and the secretory granule, whereas type-I activity would be compatible only with the intragranular environment. Kinetic analyses of (pro)insulin conversion intermediates in [35S]methionine-pulsed rat islets support this supposition. Our results suggest a simple mechanism whereby different dibasic sites can be cleaved in different cellular compartments. In conjunction with the regulation of the ionic composition of such compartments and the operation of post-Golgi segregation, our results also suggest how proteolytic conversion of diverse proproteins destined for different cellular sites can occur differentially and in a regulated manner.
The cortex of the inferior parietal lobule in primates is important for spatial perception and spatially oriented behavior. Recordings of single neurons in this area in behaving monkeys showed that the visual sensitivity of the retinotopic receptive fields changes systematically with the angle of gaze. The activity of many of the neurons can be largely described by the product of a gain factor that is a function of the eye position and the response profile of the visual receptive field. This operation produces an eye position-dependent tuning for locations in head-centered coordinate space.
Nerve cells communicate with each other through two mechanisms, referred to as fast and slow synaptic transmission. Fast-acting neurotransmitters, e.g., glutamate (excitatory) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (inhibitory), achieve effects on their target cells within one millisecond by virtue of opening ligand-operated ion channels. In contrast, all of the effects of the biogenic amine and peptide neurotransmitters, as well as many of the effects of glutamate and GABA, are achieved over hundreds of milliseconds to minutes by slow synaptic transmission. This latter process is mediated through an enormously more complicated sequence of biochemical steps, involving second messengers, protein kinases, and protein phosphatases. Slow-acting neurotransmitters control the efficacy of fast synaptic transmission by regulating the efficiency of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals and by regulating the efficiency with which fast-acting neurotransmitters produce their effects on postsynaptic receptors.
In the Drosophila embryo, early developmental decisions lead to all cells adopting one of several initial fates, such as those characteristic of the germ layers. The central nervous system is formed subsequently from the neurogenic region of the ectoderm, in which progenitor cells of the neuroblasts and ventral epidermis are intermingled. Two classes of genes govern the segregation of neuroblasts and peripheral sensory organs. The pro-neural class of genes, for example, the achaete-scute complex, participates in the initial decision to make each uniquely positioned neuroblast or sensory organ, but are initially expressed in groups of cells. The segregation of a neuroblast or sensory organ from an equivalent group of equipotential cells involves a mechanism of lateral inhibition whereby the future epidermal cells are prevented from engaging in the primary dominant neural fate. In the absence of this inhibitory signal, all cells of the group will become neural by default. The neurogenic class of genes is thought to mediate these cell interactions. Here we report that cells in embryos mutant for shaggy which are unable to adopt any of the early initial fates, instead develop neural characteristics.
The primate somatosensory cortex, which processes tactile stimuli, contains a topographic representation of the signals it receives, but the way in which such maps are maintained is poorly understood. Previous studies of cortical plasticity indicated that changes in cortical representation during learning arise largely as a result of hebbian synaptic change mechanisms. Here we show, using owl monkeys trained to respond to specific stimulus sequence events, that serial application of stimuli to the fingers results in changes to the neuronal response specificity and maps of the hand surfaces in the true primary somatosensory cortical field (S1 area 3b). In this representational remodelling stimuli applied asychronously to the fingers resulted in these fingers being integrated in their representation, whereas fingers to which stimuli were applied asynchronously were segregated in their representation. Ventroposterior thalamus response maps derived in these monkeys were not equivalently reorganized. This representational plasticity appears to be cortical in origin.
Many metabolic diseases affecting the central nervous system are refractory to treatment because the blood-brain barrier restricts entry of therapeutic molecules. It may be possible to deliver therapeutic gene products directly to the brain by transplantation of neural progenitor cells, which can integrate into the murine central nervous system in a cytoarchitecturally appropriate manner. We tested this approach in mucopolysaccharidosis VII (Sly disease), a lysosomal storage disorder of humans, dogs and mice caused by an inherited deficiency of beta-glucuronidase. Lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans occurs in the brain and other tissues, causing a fatal progressive degenerative disorder, including mental retardation. Treatments are designed to provide a source of normal enzyme for uptake by diseased cells. We report here that by transplanting beta-glucuronidase-expressing neural progenitors into the cerebral ventricles of newborn mice, donor cells engrafted throughout the neuraxis. At maturity, donor-derived cells were present as normal constituents of diverse brain regions. beta-Glucuronidase activity was expressed along the entire neuraxis, resulting in widespread correction of lysosomal storage in neurons and glia in affected mice.
Within the substantia nigra, the dendrites of dopaminergic neurons that project to the striatum appear to play an active and nonclassical role in the physiology of the neuron in that they release transmitter and protein, but little is known of the factors controlling release of substances from these dendrites. In this study, we show that 5-hydroxytryptamine, which is contained in afferent fibres to the substantia nigra, is present in terminals making direct synaptic contact with dopaminergic neurons and also that it has a site-dependent, receptor-mediated, facilitatory effect on a specific dendritic calcium-dependent potential in nigrostriatal neurons in vitro. The ionic and spatial features of this response, which is insensitive to blockade by three different K+-channel antagonists, could correspond to those underlying the dendritic release of dopamine.
The cerebral cortex receives input from lower brain regions, and its function is traditionally considered to be processing that input through successive stages to reach an appropriate output. However, the cortical circuit contains many interconnections, including those feeding back from higher centres, and is continuously active even in the absence of sensory inputs. Such spontaneous firing has a structure that reflects the coordinated activity of specific groups of neurons. Moreover, the membrane potential of cortical neurons fluctuates spontaneously between a resting (DOWN) and a depolarized (UP) state, which may also be coordinated. The elevated firing rate in the UP state follows sensory stimulation and provides a substrate for persistent activity, a network state that might mediate working memory. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we reconstructed the dynamics of spontaneous activity of up to 1,400 neurons in slices of mouse visual cortex. Here we report the occurrence of synchronized UP state transitions ('cortical flashes') that occur in spatially organized ensembles involving small numbers of neurons. Because of their stereotyped spatiotemporal dynamics, we conclude that network UP states are circuit attractors--emergent features of feedback neural networks that could implement memory states or solutions to computational problems.
Archaeopteryx, the earliest known flying bird (avialan) from the Late Jurassic period, exhibits many shared primitive characters with more basal coelurosaurian dinosaurs (the clade including all theropods more bird-like than Allosaurus), such as teeth, a long bony tail and pinnate feathers. However, Archaeopteryx possessed asymmetrical flight feathers on its wings and tail, together with a wing feather arrangement shared with modern birds. This suggests some degree of powered flight capability but, until now, little was understood about the extent to which its brain and special senses were adapted for flight. We investigated this problem by computed tomography scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction of the braincase of the London specimen of Archaeopteryx. Here we show the reconstruction of the braincase from which we derived endocasts of the brain and inner ear. These suggest that Archaeopteryx closely resembled modern birds in the dominance of the sense of vision and in the possession of expanded auditory and spatial sensory perception in the ear. We conclude that Archaeopteryx had acquired the derived neurological and structural adaptations necessary for flight. An enlarged forebrain suggests that it had also developed enhanced somatosensory integration with these special senses demanded by a lifestyle involving flying ability.
The development of the vertebrate limb serves as an amenable system for studying signaling pathways that lead to tissue patterning and proliferation. Limbs originate as a consequence of a differential growth of cells from the lateral plate mesoderm at specific axial levels. At the tip of the limb primordia the progress zone, a proliferating group of mesenchymal cells, induces the overlying ectoderm to differentiate into a specialized structure termed the apical ectodermal ridge. Subsequent limb outgrowth requires reciprocal signalling between the ridge and the progress zone. The Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors is induced in response to several signals that lead to cell growth, differentiation, inflammatory responses, apoptosis and neoplastic transformation. In unstimulated cells, NF-kappaB is associated in the cytoplasm with an inhibitory protein, I-kappaB. In response to an external signal, I-kappaB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and degraded, releasing NF-kappaB to enter the nucleus and activate transcription. Here we show that Rel/NF-kappaB genes are expressed in the progress zone of the developing chick limb bud. When the activity of Rel/NF-kappaB proteins is blocked by infection with viral vectors that produce transdominant-negative I-kappaBalpha proteins, limb outgrowth is arrested. Our results indicate that Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors play a role in vertebrate limb development.
Glutamate and aspartate are endogenous excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters widely distributed in the mammalian central nervous system. Aspartate was shown to induce a large membrane current sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptor antagonists in Purkinje cells from mice lacking functional NMDA receptors (NR1(-/-)). This response was accompanied by high permeability to calcium. In contrast, no current was induced by aspartate in hippocampal neurons and cerebellar granule cells from NR1(-/-) mice. Several other glutamate receptor agonists failed to evoke this response. Thus, in Purkinje cells, aspartate activates a distinct response capable of contributing to synaptic plasticity through calcium permeability.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common inherited neuromuscular disease in adults, with a global incidence of 1 in 8000 individuals. DM is an autosomal dominant, multisystemic disorder characterized primarily by myotonia and progressive muscle weakness. Genomic and complementary DNA probes that map to a 10-kilobase Eco RI genomic fragment from human chromosome 19q13.3 have been used to detect a variable length polymorphism in individuals with DM. Increases in the size of the allele in patients with DM are now shown to be due to an increased number of trinucleotide CTG repeats in the 3' untranslated region of a DM candidate gene. An increase in the severity of the disease in successive generations (genetic anticipation) is accompanied by an increase in the number of trinucleotide repeats. Nearly all cases of DM (98 percent or 253 of 258 individuals) displayed expansion of the CTG repeat region. These results suggest that DM is primarily caused by mutations that generate an amplification of a specific CTG repeat.
Mild tail pinch reliably and rapidly induced eating, gnawing, or licking behavior in all animals tested. Eating was by far the predominant response. Pharmacological analysis of the involvement of the brain catecholamines in tail-pinch behavior suggests that it is critically dependent on the nigrostriatal dopamine system.
The liver-expressed microRNA-122 (miR-122) is essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA accumulation in cultured liver cells, but its potential as a target for antiviral intervention has not been assessed. We found that treatment of chronically infected chimpanzees with a locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotide (SPC3649) complementary to miR-122 leads to long-lasting suppression of HCV viremia, with no evidence of viral resistance or side effects in the treated animals. Furthermore, transcriptome and histological analyses of liver biopsies demonstrated derepression of target mRNAs with miR-122 seed sites, down-regulation of interferon-regulated genes, and improvement of HCV-induced liver pathology. The prolonged virological response to SPC3649 treatment without HCV rebound holds promise of a new antiviral therapy with a high barrier to resistance.
Neurotransmission at most excitatory synapses in the brain operates through two types of glutamate receptor termed alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors; these mediate the fast and slow components of excitatory postsynaptic potentials respectively. Activation of NMDA receptors can also lead to a long-lasting modification in synaptic efficiency at glutamatergic synapses; this is exemplified in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where NMDA receptors mediate the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). It is believed that in this region LTP is maintained by a specific increase in the AMPA receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission. We now report, however, that a pharmacologically isolated NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic response can undergo robust, synapse-specific LTP. This finding has implications for neuropathologies such as epilepsy and neurodegeneration, in which excessive NMDA receptor activation has been implicated. It adds fundamentally to theories of synaptic plasticity because NMDA receptor activation may, in addition to causing increased synaptic efficiency, directly alter the plasticity of synapses.
Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) respond differently to a simple visual element presented in isolation from when it is embedded within a complex image. This difference, a specific modulation by surrounding elements in the image, is mediated by short- and long-range connections within V1 and by feedback from other areas. Here we study the role of short-range connections in this process, and relate it to the layout of local inhomogeneities in the cortical maps of orientation and space. By measuring correlation between neuron pairs located in optically imaged maps of V1 orientation columns we show that the strength of local connections between cells is a graded function of lateral separation across cortex, largely radially symmetrical and relatively independent of orientation preferences. We then show the contextual influence of flanking visual elements on neuronal responses varies systematically with a neuron's position within the cortical orientation map. The strength of this contextual influence on a neuron can be predicted from a model of local connections based on simple overlap with particular features of the orientation map. This indicates that local intracortical circuitry could endow neurons with a graded specialization for processing angular visual features such as corners and T junctions, and this specialization could have its own functional cortical map, linked with the orientation map.
The lethal yellow (AY/a) mouse has a defect in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) signaling in the brain that leads to obesity, and is resistant to the anorexigenic effects of the hormone leptin. It has been proposed that the weight-reducing effects of leptin are thus transmitted primarily by way of POMC neurons. However, the central effects of defective POMC signaling, and the absence of leptin, on weight gain in double-mutant lethal yellow (AY/a) leptin-deficient (lepob/lepob) mice were shown to be independent and additive. Furthermore, deletion of the leptin gene restored leptin sensitivity to AY/a mice. This result implies that in the AY/a mouse, obesity is independent of leptin action, and resistance to leptin results from desensitization of leptin signaling.
Atrial natriuretic peptides, produced in the mammalian cardiac atrium, are released into the general circulation and may be actively involved in the control of blood pressure and in fluid homeostasis as antagonists of the peripheral angiotensin system. Certain cardiovascular effects of atrial natriuretic peptides may be centrally mediated, as binding sites for atrial natriuretic factor (8-33) (ANF) have been localized to the subfornical organ. This circumventricular structure lacks a blood-brain barrier and is therefore accessible to circulating peptides. It contains large numbers of angiotensin II (AII) binding sites, and has been suggested as the main central site of action for circulating AII in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid metabolism. Here we have studied binding sites for rat atrial natriuretic peptide(6-33) (rANP) and AII in the brains of spontaneously (genetic) hypertensive rats (SHR) and their normotensive controls, Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, by quantitative autoradiography. Binding sites for both peptides were highly localized in the subfornical organ. The number of rANP binding sites was decreased in the subfornical organ of both young (4 weeks old) and adult (14 weeks old) SHR compared with age-matched normotensive controls. Conversely, the number of AII binding sites was higher in both young and adult SHR compared with WKY rats. Our results suggest a central role for rANP and AII in genetic hypertension; they may act as mutual antagonists in brain areas involved in control of blood pressure and fluid regulation.
The orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR124/tumor endothelial marker 5 is highly expressed in central nervous system (CNS) endothelium. Here, we show that complete null or endothelial-specific GPR124 deletion resulted in embryonic lethality from CNS-specific angiogenesis arrest in forebrain and neural tube. Conversely, GPR124 overexpression throughout all adult vascular beds produced CNS-specific hyperproliferative vascular malformations. In vivo, GPR124 functioned cell-autonomously in endothelium to regulate sprouting, migration, and developmental expression of the blood-brain barrier marker Glut1, whereas in vitro, GPR124 mediated Cdc42-dependent directional migration to forebrain-derived, vascular endothelial growth factor-independent cues. Our results demonstrate CNS-specific angiogenesis regulation by an endothelial receptor and illuminate functions of the poorly understood adhesion GPCR subfamily. Further, the functional tropism of GPR124 marks this receptor as a therapeutic target for CNS-related vascular pathologies.
The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are key receptors in the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Here we have determined three different crystal structures of the extracellular ligand-binding region of mGluR1--in a complex with glutamate and in two unliganded forms. They all showed disulphide-linked homodimers, whose 'active' and 'resting' conformations are modulated through the dimeric interface by a packed alpha-helical structure. The bi-lobed protomer architectures flexibly change their domain arrangements to form an 'open' or 'closed' conformation. The structures imply that glutamate binding stabilizes both the 'active' dimer and the 'closed' protomer in dynamic equilibrium. Movements of the four domains in the dimer are likely to affect the separation of the transmembrane and intracellular regions, and thereby activate the receptor. This scheme in the initial receptor activation could be applied generally to G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors that possess extracellular ligand-binding sites.
In the mammalian cortex, it is generally assumed that the output information of neurons is encoded in the number and the timing of action potentials. Here, we show, by using direct patchclamp recordings from presynaptic hippocampal mossy fiber boutons, that axons transmit analog signals in addition to action potentials. Excitatory presynaptic potentials result from subthreshold dendritic synaptic inputs, which propagate several hundreds of micrometers along the axon and modulate action potential-evoked transmitter release at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse. This combined analog and action potential coding represents an additional mechanism for information transmission in a major hippocampal pathway.
Feeding induced by food deprivation is accompanied by an increased production of the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the brains of rats. This neurochemical change occurs in the nucleus accumbens, the posterior hypothalamus, and the amygdala but not in other dopaminergic nerve terminal fields such as the corpus striatum. These results indicate that the release of dopamine from particular groups of central neurons is increased during feeding and suggest that anatomically distinct subgroups of central dopaminergic neurons serve different roles in the regulation of food intake.
Paying attention to a stimulus selectively increases the ability to process it. For example, when subjects attend to a specific region of a visual scene, their sensitivity to changes at that location increases. A large number of studies describe the behavioural consequences and neurophysiological correlates of attending to spatial locations. There has, in contrast, been little study of the allocation of attention over time. Because subjects can anticipate predictable events with great temporal precision, it seems probable that they might dynamically shift their attention when performing a familiar perceptual task whose constraints changed over time. We trained monkeys to respond to a stimulus change where the probability of occurrence changed over time. Recording from area V4 of the visual cortex in these animals, we found that the modulation of neuronal responses changed according to the probability of the change occurring at that instant. Thus, we show that the attentional modulation of sensory neurons reflects a subject's anticipation of the timing of behaviourally relevant events.
The related proteins p300 and CBP (cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein)) are transcriptional co-activators that act with other factors to regulate gene expression and play roles in many cell-differentiation and signal transduction pathways. Both proteins have intrinsic histone-acetyltransferase activity and may act directly on chromatin, of which histone is a component, to facilitate transcription. They are also involved in growth control pathways, as shown by their interaction with the tumour suppressor p53 and the viral oncogenes E1A and SV40 T antigen. Here we report functional differences of p300 and CBP in vivo. We examined their roles during retinoic-acid-induced differentiation, cell-cycle exit and programmed cell death (apoptosis) of embryonal carcinoma F9 cells, using hammerhead ribozymes capable of cleaving either p300 or CBP messenger RNAs. F9 cells expressing a p300-specific ribozyme became resistant to retinoic-acid-induced differentiation, whereas cells expressing a CBP-specific ribozyme were unaffected. Similarly, retinoic-acid-induced transcriptional upregulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 required normal levels of p300, but not CBP, whereas the reverse was true for p27Kip1. In contrast, both ribozymes blocked retinoic-acid-induced apoptosis, indicating that both co-activators are required for this process. Thus, despite their similarities, p300 and CBP have distinct functions during retinoic-acid-induced differentiation of F9 cells.
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by accumulation in the brain of a family of insoluble amyloid peptides (Abeta peptides), which are produced as a result of the normal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP). Russo et al. claim that a truncated Abeta peptide that lacks the first ten amino acids accumulates in the brains of patients carrying a mutant form of pre-senilin 1 (PS1), a protein that is involved in cleavage of beta-APP. However, we have found that this same species is also overrepresented in Alzheimer's patients with mutations in beta-APP itself. Our findings do not support the conclusion of Russo et al. that pathogenic PS1 mutations may control cleavage of beta-APP by beta-secretase.
Antigenic or mitogenic stimulation of T cells induces the secretion of an array of protein hormones that regulate immune responses. Molecular cloning has contributed strongly to our present understanding of the nature of this regulation. A complementary DNA (cDNA) library prepared from a cloned concanavalin A-activated mouse T-helper cell line was screened for abundant and induction-specific cDNA's. One such randomly chosen cDNA was found to encode mouse preproenkephalin messenger RNA (mRNA). Preproenkephalin mRNA represented about 0.4 percent of the mRNA in the activated cell line but was absent in resting cells of this line. Other induced T-helper cell lines have 0.1 to 0.5 percent of their mRNA as preproenkephalin mRNA. Induced T-helper cell culture supernatants have [Met]enkephalin-immunoreactive material. The production by activated T cells of a peptide neurotransmitter identifies a signal that can potentially permit T cells to modulate the nervous system.
The amino acid at position 160 of the ligand-binding subunit, alpha 1, is an important determinant of agonist and antagonist binding to the glycine receptor. Exchange of the neighboring residues, phenylalanine at position 159 and tyrosine at position 161, increased the efficacy of amino acid agonists. Whereas wild-type alpha 1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes required 0.7 millimolar beta-alanine for a half-maximal response, the doubly mutated (F159Y,Y161F) alpha 1 subunit had an affinity for beta-alanine (which was more potent than glycine) that was 110-fold that of the wild type. Also, gamma-aminobutyric acid and D-serine, amino acids that do not activate wild-type alpha 1 receptors, efficiently gated the mutant channel. Thus, aromatic hydroxyl groups are crucial for ligand discrimination at inhibitory amino acid receptors.
Phosphorylation of the neurofilament proteins of high and medium relative molecular mass, as well as of the Alzheimer's tau protein, is thought to be catalysed by a protein kinase with Cdc2-like substrate specificity. We have purified a novel Cdc2-like kinase from bovine brain capable of phosphorylating both the neurofilament proteins and tau. The purified enzyme is a heterodimer of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and a novel regulatory subunit, p25 (ref. 8). When overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli, p25 can activate Cdk5 in vitro. Unlike Cdk5, which is ubiquitously expressed in human tissue, the p25 transcript is expressed only in brain. A full-length complementary DNA clone showed that p25 is a truncated form of a larger protein precursor, p35, which seems to be the predominant form of the protein in crude brain extract. Cdk5/p35 is the first example of a Cdc2-like kinase with neuronal function.
Cerebral microvascular occlusion is a common phenomenon throughout life that might require greater recognition as a mechanism of brain pathology. Failure to recanalize microvessels promptly may lead to the disruption of brain circuits and significant functional deficits. Haemodynamic forces and the fibrinolytic system are considered to be the principal mechanisms responsible for recanalization of occluded cerebral capillaries and terminal arterioles. Here we identify a previously unrecognized cellular mechanism that may also be critical for this recanalization. By using high-resolution fixed-tissue microscopy and two-photon imaging in living mice we observed that a large fraction of microemboli infused through the internal carotid artery failed to be lysed or washed out within 48 h. Instead, emboli were found to translocate outside the vessel lumen within 2-7 days, leading to complete re-establishment of blood flow and sparing of the vessel. Recanalization occurred by a previously unknown mechanism of microvascular plasticity involving the rapid envelopment of emboli by endothelial membrane projections that subsequently form a new vessel wall. This was followed by the formation of an endothelial opening through which emboli translocated into the perivascular parenchyma. The rate of embolus extravasation was significantly decreased by pharmacological inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase 2/9 activity. In aged mice, extravasation was markedly delayed, resulting in persistent tissue hypoxia, synaptic damage and cell death. Alterations in the efficiency of the protective mechanism that we have identified may have important implications in microvascular pathology, stroke recovery and age-related cognitive decline.
Incubation of cortical synaptic membranes with low concentrations of calcium resulted in a decrease in the amount of a high-molecular-weight doublet protein and an increase in the sodium-independent binding of glutamate. Both effects were blocked by the thiol protease inhibitor leupeptin. These results suggest that calcium-induced proteolysis of membrane components regulates the number of glutamate receptors in neuronal membranes.
Amino acid, polyamine, and organocation (APC) transporters are secondary transporters that play essential roles in nutrient uptake, neurotransmitter recycling, ionic homeostasis, and regulation of cell volume. Here, we present the crystal structure of apo-ApcT, a proton-coupled broad-specificity amino acid transporter, at 2.35 angstrom resolution. The structure contains 12 transmembrane helices, with the first 10 consisting of an inverted structural repeat of 5 transmembrane helices like the leucine transporter LeuT. The ApcT structure reveals an inward-facing, apo state and an amine moiety of lysine-158 located in a position equivalent to the sodium ion site Na2 of LeuT. We propose that lysine-158 is central to proton-coupled transport and that the amine group serves the same functional role as the Na2 ion in LeuT, thus demonstrating common principles among proton- and sodium-coupled transporters.
The spontaneous electrical activity in cerebral ganglia of several insect species does not disappear during diapause. Some recordings of electrical activity in pupae of the cecropia silkworm (in which the brain is considered to be electrically "silent" during diapause) suggest that at least some activity is maintained, but possibly it is restricted to certain regions of the brain.
Tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is believed to have an important role in the pathogenesis of severe infectious disease and fatal cerebral malaria is associated with high circulating levels of this cytokine. In a large case-control study in Gambian children we find that homozygotes for the TNF2 allele, a variant of the TNF-alpha gene promoter region, have a relative risk of 7 for death or severe neurological sequelae due to cerebral malaria. Although the TNF2 allele is in linkage disequilibrium with several neighbouring HLA alleles, we show that this disease association is independent of HLA class I and class II variation. These data suggest that regulatory polymorphisms of cytokine genes can affect the outcome of severe infection. The maintenance of the TNF2 allele at a gene frequency of 0.16 in The Gambia implies that the increased risk of cerebral malaria in homozygotes is counterbalanced by some biological advantage.
We describe here a new view of primary visual cortex (V1) based on measurements of neural responses in V1 to patterns called 'illusory contours' (Fig. 1a, b). Detection of an object's boundary contours is a fundamental visual task. Boundary contours are defined by discontinuities not only in luminance and colour, but also in texture, disparity and motion. Two theoretical approaches can account for illusory contour perception. The cognitive approach emphasizes top-down processes. An alternative emphasizes bottom-up processing. This latter view is supported by (1) stimulus constraints for illusory contour perception and (2) the discovery by von der Heydt and Peterhans of neurons in extrastriate visual area V2 (but not in V1) of macaque monkeys that respond to illusory contours. Using stimuli different from those used previously, we found illusory contour responses in about half the neurons studied in V1 of macaque monkeys. Therefore, there are neurons as early as V1 with the computational power to detect illusory contours and to help distinguish figure from ground.
Alopecia areata (AA) is among the most highly prevalent human autoimmune diseases, leading to disfiguring hair loss due to the collapse of immune privilege of the hair follicle and subsequent autoimmune attack. The genetic basis of AA is largely unknown. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a sample of 1,054 cases and 3,278 controls and identified 139 single nucleotide polymorphisms that are significantly associated with AA (P <or= 5 x 10(-7)). Here we show an association with genomic regions containing several genes controlling the activation and proliferation of regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), interleukin (IL)-2/IL-21, IL-2 receptor A (IL-2RA; CD25) and Eos (also known as Ikaros family zinc finger 4; IKZF4), as well as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. We also find association evidence for regions containing genes expressed in the hair follicle itself (PRDX5 and STX17). A region of strong association resides within the ULBP (cytomegalovirus UL16-binding protein) gene cluster on chromosome 6q25.1, encoding activating ligands of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2D that have not previously been implicated in an autoimmune disease. By probing the role of ULBP3 in disease pathogenesis, we also show that its expression in lesional scalp from patients with AA is markedly upregulated in the hair follicle dermal sheath during active disease. This study provides evidence for the involvement of both innate and acquired immunity in the pathogenesis of AA. We have defined the genetic underpinnings of AA, placing it within the context of shared pathways among autoimmune diseases, and implicating a novel disease mechanism, the upregulation of ULBP ligands, in triggering autoimmunity.
Although humans and their closest evolutionary relatives, the chimpanzees, are 98.7% identical in their genomic DNA sequences, they differ in many morphological, behavioral, and cognitive aspects. The underlying genetic basis of many of these differences may be altered gene expression. We have compared the transcriptome in blood leukocytes, liver, and brain of humans, chimpanzees, orangutans, and macaques using microarrays, as well as protein expression patterns of humans and chimpanzees using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We also studied three mouse species that are approximately as related to each other as are humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans. We identified species-specific gene expression patterns indicating that changes in protein and gene expression have been particularly pronounced in the human brain.
Neuroblastoma, an embryonal tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, accounts for approximately 15% of all deaths due to childhood cancer. High-risk neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive; even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy, relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal. Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas. Five non-synonymous sequence variations were identified in the kinase domain of ALK, of which three were somatic and two were germ line. The most frequent mutation, F1174L, was also identified in three different neuroblastoma cell lines. ALK complementary DNAs encoding the F1174L and R1275Q variants, but not the wild-type ALK cDNA, transformed interleukin-3-dependent murine haematopoietic Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutations were sensitive to the small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, TAE684 (ref. 4). Furthermore, two human neuroblastoma cell lines harbouring the F1174L mutation were also sensitive to the inhibitor. Cytotoxicity was associated with increased amounts of apoptosis as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ALK expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with the F1174L mutation also resulted in apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation. Thus, activating alleles of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are present in primary neuroblastoma tumours and in established neuroblastoma cell lines, and confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition with small molecules, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy of this disease.
Three groups of gamma-aminobutyric acid--containing neurons were found in the mammillary region of the posterior hypothalamus. The groups correspond to the tuberal, caudal, and postmammillary caudal magnocellular nuclei. Many cells in these nuclei were retrogradely labeled with fast blue after the injection of this fluorescent dye into the neocortex. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that these same neurons also contained the gamma-aminobutyric acid-synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase. These results provide morphological evidence for a gamma-aminobutyric acid pathway arising in magnocellular neurons of the posterior hypothalamus and innervating the neocortex.
Several neurotransmitters act through G-protein-coupled receptors to evoke a 'slow' excitation of neurons. These include peptides, such as substance P and neurotensin, as well as acetylcholine and noradrenaline. Unlike the fast (approximately millisecond) ionotropic actions of small-molecule neurotransmitters, the slow excitation is not well understood at the molecular level, but can be mainly attributed to suppressing K(+) currents and/or activating a non-selective cation channel. The molecular identity of this cation channel has yet to be determined; similarly, how the channel is activated and its relative contribution to neuronal excitability induced by the neuropeptides are unknown. Here we show that, in the mouse hippocampal and ventral tegmental area neurons, substance P and neurotensin activate a channel complex containing NALCN and a large previously unknown protein UNC-80. The activation by substance P through TACR1 (a G-protein-coupled receptor for substance P) occurs by means of a unique mechanism: it does not require G-protein activation but is dependent on Src family kinases. These findings identify NALCN as the cation channel activated by substance P receptor, and suggest that UNC-80 and Src family kinases, rather than a G protein, are involved in the coupling from receptor to channel.
The administration of choline in doses previously shown to elevate brain acetylcholine concentrations also increases the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in rat caudate nuclei. This response can be blocked by atropine, a muscarinic antagonist. These findings indicate that choline-induced increases in acetylcholine concentrations may be associated with parallel changes in the amount of the neurotransmitter released into synapses.
In mammals, X-chromosome dosage compensation is achieved by inactivating one X chromosome in female cells. To test the hypothesis that genes on the silent X chromosome reactivate as a consequence of ageing, we examined the X-linked hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus in 41 women who are heterozygous for mutations at this locus, leading to severe deficiency of the enzyme (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). We find that heterozygotes who are more than 10 yr old have an excess of HPRT+ skin fibroblast clones (59% rather than the 50% expected as a consequence of random X inactivation) but this excess does not increase with age. Further studies of eight of these heterozygotes show that the silent locus does not detectably reactivate spontaneously in culture, but only in response to treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, a potent inhibitor of methylation. There is no age difference in the frequency of this reactivation as assayed by HATr clones, and a more sensitive autoradiographic assay shows only a twofold difference between young and old heterozygotes. Thus, age-related reactivation is not a feature of all X-linked loci, and may have species, tissue and locus-specific determinants.
Although acute, millisecond-to-millisecond actions of neurotransmitters are well documented, diverse longer-term effects have been discovered only recently. Emerging evidence indicates that these signals regulate a variety of neuronal processes, from phenotypic expression to neurite outgrowth. Here we show that a single putative transmitter, vasoactive intestinal peptide, can exert multiple, long-term effects simultaneously: it stimulates mitosis, promotes neurite outgrowth and enhances survival of sympathetic neuron precursors in culture. As the peptide seems to be a normal presynaptic transmitter in the sympathetic system, synaptic transmission may exert hitherto unexpected effects.
Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, which is thought to be causal for the pathology and subsequent cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Cleavage by beta-secretase at the amino terminus of the Abeta peptide sequence, between residues 671 and 672 of APP, leads to the generation and extracellular release of beta-cleaved soluble APP, and a corresponding cell-associated carboxy-terminal fragment. Cleavage of the C-terminal fragment by gamma-secretase(s) leads to the formation of Abeta. The pathogenic mutation K670M671-->N670L671 at the beta-secretase cleavage site in APP, which was discovered in a Swedish family with familial Alzheimer's disease, leads to increased beta-secretase cleavage of the mutant substrate. Here we describe a membrane-bound enzyme activity that cleaves full-length APP at the beta-secretase cleavage site, and find it to be the predominant beta-cleavage activity in human brain. We have purified this enzyme activity to homogeneity from human brain using a new substrate analogue inhibitor of the enzyme activity, and show that the purified enzyme has all the properties predicted for beta-secretase. Cloning and expression of the enzyme reveals that human brain beta-secretase is a new membrane-bound aspartic proteinase.
Didelot et al. (Reports, 11 August 2006, p. 851) claimed that Drosophila Tequila (Teq) and human neurotrypsin are orthologs and concluded that deficient long-term memory after Teq inactivation indicates that neurotrypsin plays its essential role for human cognitive functions through a similar mechanism. Our analyses suggest that Teq and neurotrypsin are not orthologous, leading us to question their equivalent roles in higher brain function.
Tyrosine hydroxylase catalyses the initial, rate-limiting step in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. Catecholamines, which include dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline, are important neurotransmitters and hormones that regulate visceral functions, motor coordination and arousal in adults. The gene encoding tyrosine hydroxylase becomes transcriptionally active in developing neuroblasts during mid-gestation of rodent embryos, before the onset of neurotransmission. Here we show that inactivation of both tyrosine hydroxylase alleles results in mid-gestational lethality: about 90% of mutant embryos die between embryonic days 11.5 and 15.5, apparently of cardiovascular failure. Administration of L-DOPA (dihydroxyphenylalanine), the product of the tyrosine hydroxylase reaction, to pregnant females results in complete rescue of mutant mice in utero. Without further treatment, however, they die before weaning. We conclude that catecholamines are essential for mouse fetal development and postnatal survival.
Truncation of the tumour suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) constitutively activates the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway. Apc has a role in development: for example, embryos of mice with truncated Apc do not complete gastrulation. To understand this role more fully, we examined the effect of truncated Apc on zebrafish development. Here we show that, in contrast to mice, zebrafish do complete gastrulation. However, mutant hearts fail to loop and form excessive endocardial cushions. Conversely, overexpression of Apc or Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), a secreted Wnt inhibitor, blocks cushion formation. In wild-type hearts, nuclear beta-catenin, the hallmark of activated canonical Wnt signalling, accumulates only in valve-forming cells, where it can activate a Tcf reporter. In mutant hearts, all cells display nuclear beta-catenin and Tcf reporter activity, while valve markers are markedly upregulated. Concomitantly, proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, normally restricted to endocardial cushions, occur throughout the endocardium. Our findings identify a novel role for Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in determining endocardial cell fate.
It has been proposed that cell-cell recognition occurs by means of local cell surface modulation of a small number of proteins rather than by expression of large numbers of different cell surface markers. Several different cell adhesion molecules (CAM's) have now been found in a number of vertebrate species in different tissues such as liver and striated muscle and even in a single complex structure such as the brain, where different molecules specific for neurons and glia have been identified. The neuron-specific molecule is involved in early embryonic events but also mediates neurite fasciculation, neuromuscular interaction, and orderly layering of neural tissue. It undergoes local surface modulation with loss of sialic acid during development. A failure of this process is closely correlated with connectional disorders in the staggerer mutant of the mouse. The accumulated data on this and other CAM's favor modulation theories rather than strict chemoaffinity theories of cell-cell recognition.
The occurrence of manomary adenocarcinonmas in C3H mice is largely inhibited by prolonged admninistration of 0.1 percent isonicotinic acid hydrazide in drinking water. At the same time that this compound produtced the inhibitory action, it also increased the incidence of pulmonary adenomas.
Electrical activity has been shown to regulate development in a variety of species and in various structures, including the retina, spinal cord and cortex. Within the mammalian cortex specifically, the development of dendrites and commissural axons in pyramidal cells is activity-dependent. However, little is known about the developmental role of activity in the other major cortical population of neurons, the GABA-producing interneurons. These neurons are morphologically and functionally heterogeneous and efforts over the past decade have focused on determining the mechanisms that contribute to this diversity. It was recently discovered that 30% of all cortical interneurons arise from a relatively novel source within the ventral telencephalon, the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE). Owing to their late birth date, these interneurons populate the cortex only after the majority of other interneurons and pyramidal cells are already in place and have started to functionally integrate. Here we demonstrate in mice that for CGE-derived reelin (Re)-positive and calretinin (Cr)-positive (but not vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive) interneurons, activity is essential before postnatal day 3 for correct migration, and that after postnatal day 3, glutamate-mediated activity controls the development of their axons and dendrites. Furthermore, we show that the engulfment and cell motility 1 gene (Elmo1), a target of the transcription factor distal-less homeobox 1 (Dlx1), is selectively expressed in Re(+) and Cr(+) interneurons and is both necessary and sufficient for activity-dependent interneuron migration. Our findings reveal a selective requirement for activity in shaping the cortical integration of specific neuronal subtypes.
Dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopamine system results in marked disorders of movement such as occur in Parkinson's disease. Functions of this dopamine-containing projection system were examined in monkeys trained in a classical conditioning task, and the effects of striatal dopamine depletion were tested. Unilateral dopamine loss substantially reduced the acquired sensory responsiveness of striatal neurons monitored electrophysiologically. This effect was ipsilateral and selective, and could be reversed by apomorphine. These results suggest that the primate nigrostriatal system modulates expression of neuronal response plasticity in the striatum during sensorimotor learning.
Embryonic signalling pathways regulate progenitor cell fates in mammalian epithelial development and cancer. Prompted by the requirement for sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling in lung development, we investigated a role for this pathway in regeneration and carcinogenesis of airway epithelium. Here we demonstrate extensive activation of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway within the airway epithelium during repair of acute airway injury. This mode of Hh signalling is characterized by the elaboration and reception of the Shh signal within the epithelial compartment, and immediately precedes neuroendocrine differentiation. We reveal a similar pattern of Hh signalling in airway development during normal differentiation of pulmonary neuroendocrine precursor cells, and in a subset of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a highly aggressive and frequently lethal human tumour with primitive neuroendocrine features. These tumours maintain their malignant phenotype in vitro and in vivo through ligand-dependent Hh pathway activation. We propose that some types of SCLC might recapitulate a critical, Hh-regulated event in airway epithelial differentiation. This requirement for Hh pathway activation identifies a common lethal malignancy that may respond to pharmacological blockade of the Hh signalling pathway.
The differentiation of multipotential progenitor cells in the vertebrate retina into photoreceptors, neurons and glial cells is regulated in part by cell-cell signalling. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha is one of the extracellular signals implicated in the control of several aspects of retinal development, including proliferation and cell fate. The way cells interpret pleiotropic signals such as TGF-alpha is influenced by the level of expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) in some cell lines. To address the influence of receptor level on responses of retinal progenitor cells to TGF-alpha, additional copies of EGF-Rs were introduced in vitro and in vivo with a retrovirus. Normally in vitro, low concentrations of TGF-alpha stimulated proliferation whereas high concentrations biased choice of cell fate, inhibiting differentiation into rod photoreceptors while promoting differentiation into Muller glial cells. We report here that introduction of extra EGF-Rs into progenitor cells in vitro reduced the concentration of TGF-alpha required for changes in rod and Muller cell differentiation but did not enhance proliferation. Introduction of extra EGF-Rs in vivo increased the proportion of clones that contained Muller glial cells, suggesting that receptor level is normally limiting. These findings demonstrate that responsiveness to extracellular signals during development can be modulated by the introduction of additional receptors, and suggest that the level of expression of receptors for these signals contributes to the regulation of cell fate.
Decision theory proposes that humans and animals decide what to do in a given situation by assessing the relative value of each possible response. This assessment can be computed, in part, from the probability that each action will result in a gain and the magnitude of the gain expected. Here we show that the gain (or reward) a monkey can expect to realize from an eye-movement response modulates the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area, an area of primate cortex that is thought to transform visual signals into eye-movement commands. We also show that the activity of these neurons is sensitive to the probability that a particular response will result in a gain. When animals can choose freely between two alternative responses, the choices subjects make and neuronal activation in this area are both correlated with the relative amount of gain that the animal can expect from each response. Our data indicate that a decision-theoretic model may provide a powerful new framework for studying the neural processes that intervene between sensation and action.
How instructive cues present on the cell surface have their precise effects on the actin cytoskeleton is poorly understood. Semaphorins are one of the largest families of these instructive cues and are widely studied for their effects on cell movement, navigation, angiogenesis, immunology and cancer. Semaphorins/collapsins were characterized in part on the basis of their ability to drastically alter actin cytoskeletal dynamics in neuronal processes, but despite considerable progress in the identification of semaphorin receptors and their signalling pathways, the molecules linking them to the precise control of cytoskeletal elements remain unknown. Recently, highly unusual proteins of the Mical family of enzymes have been found to associate with the cytoplasmic portion of plexins, which are large cell-surface semaphorin receptors, and to mediate axon guidance, synaptogenesis, dendritic pruning and other cell morphological changes. Mical enzymes perform reduction-oxidation (redox) enzymatic reactions and also contain domains found in proteins that regulate cell morphology. However, nothing is known of the role of Mical or its redox activity in mediating morphological changes. Here we report that Mical directly links semaphorins and their plexin receptors to the precise control of actin filament (F-actin) dynamics. We found that Mical is both necessary and sufficient for semaphorin-plexin-mediated F-actin reorganization in vivo. Likewise, we purified Mical protein and found that it directly binds F-actin and disassembles both individual and bundled actin filaments. We also found that Mical utilizes its redox activity to alter F-actin dynamics in vivo and in vitro, indicating a previously unknown role for specific redox signalling events in actin cytoskeletal regulation. Mical therefore is a novel F-actin-disassembly factor that provides a molecular conduit through which actin reorganization-a hallmark of cell morphological changes including axon navigation-can be precisely achieved spatiotemporally in response to semaphorins.
Mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene produce an animal model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. To test a new therapeutic strategy for ALS, we examined the effect of caspase inhibition in transgenic mice expressing mutant human SOD1 with a substitution of glycine to alanine in position 93 (mSOD1(G93A)). Intracerebroventricular administration of zVAD-fmk, a broad caspase inhibitor, delays disease onset and mortality. Moreover, zVAD-fmk inhibits caspase-1 activity as well as caspase-1 and caspase-3 mRNA up-regulation, providing evidence for a non-cell-autonomous pathway regulating caspase expression. Caspases play an instrumental role in neurodegeneration in transgenic mSOD1(G93A) mice, which suggests that caspase inhibition may have a protective role in ALS.
The predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), activates chloride-selective ion pores integral to the receptor complex. Subunits comprising the presumed hetero-pentameric GABA channel have been cloned, but little information is available on the domains important for activation. Rat wild-type or mutated alpha 1-, beta 2- and gamma 2-subunits (designated alpha, beta and gamma) were coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes and examined electrophysiologically. We report here the identification of two separate and homologous domains of the beta-subunit, each of which contributes a tyrosine and threonine essential for activation by GABA. Conservative substitution of each of these four amino acids dramatically decreased GABA channel sensitivity to activation by GABA and the GABA agonist muscimol. These substitutions, however, did not impair activation by the barbiturate pentobarbital, indicating these two different classes of agonists activate GABA channels through distinct mechanisms. We also present evidence suggesting that the two identified domains of the beta-subunit contribute a major component of the GABA receptor.
The vertebrate brain continues to produce new neurons throughout life. In the rat hippocampus, several thousand are produced each day, many of which die within weeks. Associative learning can enhance their survival; however, until now it was unknown whether new neurons are involved in memory formation. Here we show that a substantial reduction in the number of newly generated neurons in the adult rat impairs hippocampal-dependent trace conditioning, a task in which an animal must associate stimuli that are separated in time. A similar reduction did not affect learning when the same stimuli are not separated in time, a task that is hippocampal-independent. The reduction in neurogenesis did not induce death of mature hippocampal neurons or permanently alter neurophysiological properties of the CA1 region, such as long-term potentiation. Moreover, recovery of cell production was associated with the ability to acquire trace memories. These results indicate that newly generated neurons in the adult are not only affected by the formation of a hippocampal-dependent memory, but also participate in it.
The Raf-1 protein kinase participates in transduction of mitogenic signals, but its mechanisms of activation are incompletely understood. Treatment of human Raf-1 purified from insect Sf9 cells co-expressing c-H-Ras and Src(Y527F) (in which phenylalanine replaces tyrosine at residue 527) with either serine-threonine or tyrosine phosphatases resulted in enzymatic inactivation of Raf-1. Inactivation of purified Raf-1 was blocked by addition of either the 14-3-3 zeta protein or heat shock protein 90. Loading of plasma membranes from transformed cells with guanosine triphosphate (GTP) resulted in inactivation of endogenous or exogenous Raf-1; inactivation was blocked by inclusion of protein phosphatase inhibitors. These results suggest the existence of protein phosphatases in the cell membrane that are regulated by GTP and are responsible for Raf-1 inactivation.
The ability to grow neurons in culture has made possible great strides in the field of neuroscience. Advances in optical microscopy, together with techniques involving the retroviral transformation of neuronal precursors and cell fusion, will pave the way for further developments.
Agonist-bound receptors activate heterotrimeric (alpha beta gamma) G proteins by catalysing replacement by GTP of GDP bound to the alpha subunit, resulting in dissociation of alpha-GTP from the beta gamma subunits. In most cases, alpha-GTP carries the signal to effectors, as in hormonal stimulation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by alpha s and alpha i respectively. By contrast, genetic evidence in yeast and studies in mammalian cells suggest that beta gamma subunits of G proteins may also regulate effector pathways. Indeed, of the four recombinant mammalian adenylyl cyclases available for study, two, adenylyl cyclases II and IV, are stimulated by beta gamma. This effect of beta gamma requires costimulation by alpha s-GTP. This conditional pattern of effector responsiveness led to the prediction that receptors coupled to many G proteins will mediate elevation of cellular cyclic AMP, provided that Gs is also active. We now confirm this prediction. Coexpression of mutationally active alpha s with adenylyl cyclase II converted agonists that act through 'inhibitory' receptors (coupled to Gi) into stimulators of cAMP synthesis. Experiments using pertussis toxin and a putative scavenger of beta gamma, the alpha subunit of transducin, suggest that beta gamma subunits of the Gi proteins mediated this stimulation. These findings assign a new signalling function to beta gamma subunits of Gi proteins, the conditional stimulation of cAMP synthesis by adenylyl cyclase II.
Fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system can be modulated by neurotransmitters and second-messenger pathways. For example, transmission at glutamatergic synapses can be depressed by the metabotropic glutamate receptor, providing autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback. Metabotropic glutamate receptor inhibition of Ca2+ channels may contribute to this pathway. In contrast, stimulation of protein kinase C can enhance excitatory synaptic transmission, whereas both depression and enhancement of Ca2+ current have been reported. Here we show that in hippocampal CA3 and cortical pyramidal neurons, activation of protein kinase C enhances current through N-type Ca2+ channels and, in addition, dramatically reduces G protein-dependent inhibition of these same channels by the metabotropic glutamate receptor. In parallel experiments on fast excitatory transmission at corticostriatal synapses, kinase C activators were similarly found to reduce the inhibitory effect produced by stimulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor. The results show that second-to-second control of Ca2+ channels by the metabotropic glutamate receptor can itself be modulated on a slower timescale by protein kinase C. These mechanisms may be used in the control of fast excitatory synaptic transmission.
As previously shown in the hippocampus and other brain areas, patterns of firing-rate correlations between neurons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex during a repetitive sequence task were preserved during subsequent sleep, suggesting that waking patterns are reactivated. We found that, during sleep, reactivation of spatiotemporal patterns was coherent across the network and compressed in time by a factor of 6 to 7. Thus, when behavioral constraints are removed, the brain's intrinsic processing speed may be much faster than it is in real time. Given recent evidence implicating the medial prefrontal cortex in retrieval of long-term memories, the observed replay may play a role in the process of memory consolidation.
Abuse of the dissociative anesthetic ketamine can lead to a syndrome indistinguishable from schizophrenia. In animals, repetitive exposure to this N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor antagonist induces the dysfunction of a subset of cortical fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with loss of expression of parvalbumin and the gamma-aminobutyric acid-producing enzyme GAD67. We show here that exposure of mice to ketamine induced a persistent increase in brain superoxide due to activation in neurons of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Decreasing superoxide production prevented the effects of ketamine on inhibitory interneurons in the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that NADPH oxidase may represent a novel target for the treatment of ketamine-induced psychosis.
In Drosophila, the Wingless and Notch signaling pathways function in m any of the same developmental patterning events. Genetic analysis demonstrates that the dishevelled gene, which encodes a molecule previously implicated in implementation of the Winglass signal, interacts antagonistically with Notch and one of its known ligands, Delta. A direct physical interaction between Dishevelled and the Notch carboxyl terminus, distal to the cdc10/ankyrin repeats, suggests a mechanism for this interaction. It is proposed that Dishevelled, in addition to transducing the Wingless signal, blocks Notch signaling directly, thus providing a molecular mechanism for the inhibitory cross talk observed between these pathways.
The mammalian eye is a remarkable optical device, but its design is not perfect. The blood vessels that supply the inner retina are located in front of the photoreceptor layer, blocking access to light. Their shadows create a pattern of blindness in the field of vision that corresponds precisely to the location of the largest vessels in the eye. We show here that in squirrel monkeys, focal deprivation by blood vessels leads to rewiring of the eye's geniculocortical projections, imprinting an image of the retinal vascular tree onto the primary visual cortex. This process illustrates vividly that local imbalances in neuronal activity can influence column formation during normal development.
The inferior temporal cortex (IT) of primates is thought to be the final visual area in the ventral stream of cortical areas responsible for object recognition. Consistent with this hypothesis, single IT neurons respond selectively to highly complex visual stimuli such as faces. However, a direct causal link between the activity of face-selective neurons and face perception has not been demonstrated. In the present study of macaque monkeys, we artificially activated small clusters of IT neurons by means of electrical microstimulation while the monkeys performed a categorization task, judging whether noisy visual images belonged to 'face' or 'non-face' categories. Here we show that microstimulation of face-selective sites, but not other sites, strongly biased the monkeys' decisions towards the face category. The magnitude of the effect depended upon the degree of face selectivity of the stimulation site, the size of the stimulated cluster of face-selective neurons, and the exact timing of microstimulation. Our results establish a causal relationship between the activity of face-selective neurons and face perception.
Excitatory amino-acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) is a high-affinity Na+-dependent L-glutamate/D,L-aspartate cell-membrane transport protein. It is expressed in brain as well as several non-nervous tissues. In brain, EAAC1 is the primary neuronal glutamate transporter. It has a polarized distribution in cells and mainly functions perisynaptically to transport glutamate from the extracellular environment. In the kidney it is involved in renal acidic amino-acid re-absorption and amino-acid metabolism. Here we describe the identification and characterization of an EAAC1-associated protein, GTRAP3-18. Like EAAC1, GTRAP3-18 is expressed in numerous tissues. It localizes to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, and specifically interacts with carboxy-terminal intracellular domain of EAAC1. Increasing the expression of GTRAP3-18 in cells reduces EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport by lowering substrate affinity. The expression of GTRAP3-18 can be upregulated by retinoic acid, which results in a specific reduction of EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport. These studies show that glutamate transport proteins can be regulated potently and that GTRAP can modulate the transport functions ascribed to EAAC1. GTRAP3-18 may be important in regulating the metabolic function of EAAC1.
The molecular basis for breast cancer metastasis to the brain is largely unknown. Brain relapse typically occurs years after the removal of a breast tumour, suggesting that disseminated cancer cells must acquire specialized functions to take over this organ. Here we show that breast cancer metastasis to the brain involves mediators of extravasation through non-fenestrated capillaries, complemented by specific enhancers of blood-brain barrier crossing and brain colonization. We isolated cells that preferentially infiltrate the brain from patients with advanced disease. Gene expression analysis of these cells and of clinical samples, coupled with functional analysis, identified the cyclooxygenase COX2 (also known as PTGS2), the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand HBEGF, and the alpha2,6-sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC5 as mediators of cancer cell passage through the blood-brain barrier. EGFR ligands and COX2 were previously linked to breast cancer infiltration of the lungs, but not the bones or liver, suggesting a sharing of these mediators in cerebral and pulmonary metastases. In contrast, ST6GALNAC5 specifically mediates brain metastasis. Normally restricted to the brain, the expression of ST6GALNAC5 in breast cancer cells enhances their adhesion to brain endothelial cells and their passage through the blood-brain barrier. This co-option of a brain sialyltransferase highlights the role of cell-surface glycosylation in organ-specific metastatic interactions.
The neuropeptide somatostatin inhibits secretion from electrically excitable cells in the pituitary, pancreas, gut and brain. In mammalian pituitary tumour cells somatostatin inhibits secretion through two distinct pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanisms. One involves inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, the other an unidentified cyclic AMP-independent mechanism that reduces Ca2+ influx by increasing membrane conductance to potassium. Here we demonstrate that the predominant electrophysiological effect of somatostatin on metabolically intact pituitary tumour cells is a large, sustained increase in the activity of the large-conductance Ca(2+)- and voltage-activated K+ channels (BK). This action of somatostatin does not involve direct effects of Ca2+, cAMP or G proteins on the channels. Our results indicate instead that somatostatin stimulates BK channel activity through protein dephosphorylation.
The interactions of distinct cofactor complexes with transcription factors are decisive determinants for the regulation of gene expression. Depending on the bound cofactor, transcription factors can have either repressing or transactivating activities. To allow a switch between these different states, regulated cofactor exchange has been proposed; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are involved in this process. LIM homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription factors associate with RLIM (RING finger LIM domain-binding protein) and with CLIM (cofactor of LIM-HD proteins; also known as NLI, Ldb and Chip) cofactors. The co-repressor RLIM inhibits the function of LIM-HD transcription factors, whereas interaction with CLIM proteins is important for the exertion of the biological activity conferred by LIM-HD transcription-factors. Here we identify RLIM as a ubiquitin protein ligase that is able to target CLIM cofactors for degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate a ubiquitination-dependent association of RLIM with LIM-HD proteins in the presence of CLIM cofactors. Our data provide a mechanistic basis for cofactor exchange on DNA-bound transcription factors, and probably represent a general mechanism of transcriptional regulation.
The capacity of the adult brain and spinal cord to repair lesions by axonal regeneration or compensatory fibre growth is extremely limited. A monoclonal antibody (IN-1) raised against NI-220/250, a myelin protein that is a potent inhibitor of neurite growth, promoted axonal regeneration and compensatory plasticity following lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) in adult rats. Here we report the cloning of nogo A, the rat complementary DNA encoding NI-220/250. The nogo gene encodes at least three major protein products (Nogo-A, -B and -C). Recombinant Nogo-A is recognized by monoclonal antibody IN-1, and it inhibits neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia and spreading of 3T3 fibroblasts in an IN-1-sensitive manner. Antibodies against Nogo-A stain CNS myelin and oligodendrocytes and allow dorsal root ganglion neurites to grow on CNS myelin and into optic nerve explants. These data show that Nogo-A is a potent inhibitor of neurite growth and an IN-1 antigen produced by oligodendrocytes, and may allow the generation of new reagents to enhance CNS regeneration and plasticity.
Concentration of urine in mammals is regulated by the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin. Binding of vasopressin to its V2 receptor leads to the insertion of water channels in apical membranes of principal cells in collecting ducts. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), the kidney fails to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin. A male patient with an autosomal recessive form of NDI was found to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in the gene encoding aquaporin-2, a water channel. Functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes revealed that each mutation resulted in nonfunctional water channel proteins. Thus, aquaporin-2 is essential for vasopressin-dependent concentration of urine.
Anatomical and physiological studies have shown that there is an area specialized for the processing of colour (area V4) in the prestriate cortex of macaque monkey brain. Earlier this century, suggestive clinical evidence for a colour centre in the brain of man was dismissed because of the association of other visual defects with the defects in colour vision. However, since the demonstration of functional specialization in the macaque cortex, the question of a colour centre in man has been reinvestigated, based on patients with similar lesions in the visual cortex. In order to study the colour centre in normal human subjects, we used the technique of positron emission tomography (PET), which measures increases in blood flow resulting from increased activity in the cerebral cortex. A comparison of the results of PET scans of subjects viewing multi-coloured and black-and-white displays has identified a region of normal human cerebral cortex specialized for colour vision.
Subcellular fractions of mouse brain were prepared by differential and sucrose density-gradient centrifugation at intervals up to 130 hours after intracerebral injection of C(14)- labeled leucine. The specific activity of the nerve ending fraction continued to rise during this period. Between 2 and 130 hours after injection there was a fivefold rise in the specific activity of the soluble protein prepared by lysing the nerve ending particles with water while the specific activity of the soluble protein from the whole homogenate concomitantly fell almost by a factor of three. The data are interpreted as being consistent with the appearance of protein in nerve endings by axoplasmic flow.
Evolution of human organismal complexity from a relatively small number of genes--only approximately twice that of worm or fly--is explained mainly by mechanisms generating multiple proteins from a single gene, the most prevalent of which is alternative pre-messenger-RNA splicing. Appropriate spatial and temporal generation of splice variants demands that alternative splicing be subject to extensive regulation, similar to transcriptional control. Activation by extracellular cues of several cellular signalling pathways can indeed regulate alternative splicing. Here we address the link between signal transduction and splice regulation. We show that the nuclear RNA-binding protein Sam68 is a new extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) target. It binds exonic splice-regulatory elements of an alternatively spliced exon that is physiologically regulated by the Ras signalling pathway, namely exon v5 of CD44. Forced expression of Sam68 enhanced ERK-mediated inclusion of the v5-exon sequence in mRNA. This enhancement was impaired by mutation of ERK-phosphorylation sites in Sam68, whereas ERK phosphorylation of Sam68 stimulated splicing of the v5 exon in vitro. Finally, Ras-pathway-induced alternative splicing of the endogenous CD44-v5 exon was abolished by suppression of Sam68 expression. Our data define Sam68 as a prototype regulator of alternative splicing whose function depends on protein modification in response to extracellular cues.
Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene initiates colorectal neoplasia. One of the biochemical activities associated with the APC protein is down-regulation of transcriptional activation mediated by beta-catenin and T cell transcription factor 4 (Tcf-4). The protein products of mutant APC genes present in colorectal tumors were found to be defective in this activity. Furthermore, colorectal tumors with intact APC genes were found to contain activating mutations of beta-catenin that altered functionally significant phosphorylation sites. These results indicate that regulation of beta-catenin is critical to APC's tumor suppressive effect and that this regulation can be circumvented by mutations in either APC or beta-catenin.
Dopamine, synthesized in rat brain slices from labeled L-tyrosine or L-dopa, can be released by electrical stimulation of a type known to induce neuronal depolarization. Pretreatment of the animals with 6-hydroxydopamine, which destroys central catecholamine-containing nerve terminals, substantially reduced the release of dopamine synthesized from [(14)C]tyrosine or from a low concentration of [(3)H]dopa, whereas the release of dopamine formed from a high concentration of [(3)H]dopa remained essentially unchanged. The observations that at high concentrations L-dopa may enter noncatecholaminergic cells, undergo decarboxylation to dopamine, and subsequently be liberated in response to depolarization suggest that dopamine may act as a substitute central transmitter, possibly in serotonergic neurons. This mechanism may contribute to L-dopa's clinical effects in parkinsonian patients.
Cells were recorded in the midbrain central gray neuropil of the cat that responded with action potentials only during fighting behavior and not while the cat was resting or while control manipulations were performed. Some other cells in the same region responded maximally during fighting, and all cells responded to at least one manipulation. Brain stimulation at sites of cells related to fighting caused the animals to hiss.
The first instar larva of Drosophila consists of a chain of segments or parasegments in which the morphological pattern characteristic of each metamere is determined by the homoeotic genes, which are active in overlapping domains and are known to interact among themselves. The interactions occur at the level of transcription and allow some homoeotic genes to control the patterns and levels of expression of others. The best known among them are the down-regulation of Antennapedia (Antp) by Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and that of Ubx by abdominal-A (abd-A) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B). It has been proposed that these cross-regulatory interactions play a part in specifying cell pattern, and hence the identity of each metamere. Here we assess the functional significance of some of these interactions by expressing the Antp, Ubx or both homoeotic genes under the control of the heat-shock promoter. Predictably, we find that homoeotic gene products evade normal regulatory controls and can be maximally expressed in regions where they are normally down-regulated but, surprisingly, we find that interruption of the normal down-regulation of Antp and Ubx has no phenotypic consequences in the epidermis, where homoeotic phenotypes are normally manifest. Hence our results challenge the view that these, and possibly other cross-regulatory interactions have a role in determining segmental identity.
To interpret the activity of living human brains, their neuroanatomy must be known in detail. New techniques to do this are urgently needed, since most of the methods now used on monkeys cannot be used on humans.
Understanding how neural activity in sensory cortices relates to perception is a central theme of neuroscience. Action potentials of sensory cortical neurons can be strongly correlated to properties of sensory stimuli and reflect the subjective judgements of an individual about stimuli. Microstimulation experiments have established a direct link from sensory activity to behaviour, suggesting that small neuronal populations can influence sensory decisions. However, microstimulation does not allow identification and quantification of the stimulated cellular elements. The sensory impact of individual cortical neurons therefore remains unknown. Here we show that stimulation of single neurons in somatosensory cortex affects behavioural responses in a detection task. We trained rats to respond to microstimulation of barrel cortex at low current intensities. We then initiated short trains of action potentials in single neurons by juxtacellular stimulation. Animals responded significantly more often in single-cell stimulation trials than in catch trials without stimulation. Stimulation effects varied greatly between cells, and on average in 5% of trials a response was induced. Whereas stimulation of putative excitatory neurons led to weak biases towards responding, stimulation of putative inhibitory neurons led to more variable and stronger sensory effects. Reaction times for single-cell stimulation were long and variable. Our results demonstrate that single neuron activity can cause a change in the animal's detection behaviour, suggesting a much sparser cortical code for sensations than previously anticipated.
X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals allows dosage compensation for X-linked gene products between the sexes. The developmental regulation of this process has been extensively investigated in mice, where the X chromosome of paternal origin (Xp) is silenced during early embryogenesis owing to imprinted expression of the regulatory RNA, Xist (X-inactive specific transcript). Paternal XCI is reversed in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst and random XCI subsequently occurs in epiblast cells. Here we show that other eutherian mammals have very different strategies for initiating XCI. In rabbits and humans, the Xist homologue is not subject to imprinting and XCI begins later than in mice. Furthermore, Xist is upregulated on both X chromosomes in a high proportion of rabbit and human embryo cells, even in the inner cell mass. In rabbits, this triggers XCI on both X chromosomes in some cells. In humans, chromosome-wide XCI has not initiated even by the blastocyst stage, despite the upregulation of XIST. The choice of which X chromosome will finally become inactive thus occurs downstream of Xist upregulation in both rabbits and humans, unlike in mice. Our study demonstrates the remarkable diversity in XCI regulation and highlights differences between mammals in their requirement for dosage compensation during early embryogenesis.
Neuronal growth cones are guided to their targets by attractive and repulsive guidance cues. In mammals, netrin-1 is a bifunctional cue, attracting some axons and repelling others. Deleted in colorectal cancer (Dcc) is a receptor for netrin-1 that mediates its chemoattractive effect on commissural axons, but the signalling mechanisms that transduce this effect are poorly understood. Here we show that Dcc activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling, by means of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1 and -2, on netrin-1 binding in both transfected cells and commissural neurons. This activation is associated with recruitment of ERK-1/2 to a Dcc receptor complex. Inhibition of ERK-1/2 antagonizes netrin-dependent axon outgrowth and orientation. Thus, activation of MAPK signalling through Dcc contributes to netrin signalling in axon growth and guidance.
Although there are elegants maps of the human brain that reveal differences in cellular architecture between different cortical regions, there is not much information about how corresponding cortical regions differ between the left and right hemispheres. As Gazzaniga explains in his Perspective, new results reveal the surprising finding of asymmetry in area 22 (which is important for language processing) of the left and right hemisphere (Galuske et al.). Clusters of neurons in area 22 of the left hemisphere are spaced farther apart and have longer axons cabling them together than neuronal clusters in area 22 of the right hemisphere.
Smooth muscle cells in the walls of many organs are vital for most bodily functions, and their abnormalities contribute to a range of diseases. Although based on a sliding-filament mechanism similar to that of striated muscles, contraction of smooth muscle is regulated by pharmacomechanical as well as by electromechanical coupling mechanisms. Recent studies have revealed previously unrecognized contractile regulatory processes, such as G-protein-coupled inhibition of myosin light-chain phosphatase, regulation of myosin light-chain kinase by other kinases, and the functional effects of smooth muscle myosin isoforms. Abnormalities of these regulatory mechanisms and isoform variations may contribute to diseases of smooth muscle, and the G-protein-coupled inhibition of protein phosphatase is also likely to be important in regulating  non-muscle cell functions mediated by cytoplasmic myosin II.
N-type calcium channels are omega-conotoxin (omega-CgTx)-sensitive, voltage-dependent ion channels involved in the control of neurotransmitter release from neurons. Multiple subtypes of voltage-dependent calcium channel complexes exist, and it is the alpha 1 subunit of the complex that forms the pore through which calcium enters the cell. The primary structures of human neuronal calcium channel alpha 1B subunits were deduced by the characterization of overlapping complementary DNAs. Two forms (alpha 1B-1 and alpha 1B-2) were identified in human neuroblastoma (IMR32) cells and in the central nervous system, but not in skeletal muscle or aorta tissues. The alpha 1B-1 subunit directs the recombinant expression of N-type calcium channel activity when it is transiently co-expressed with human neuronal beta 2 and alpha 2b subunits in mammalian HEK293 cells. The recombinant channel was irreversibly blocked by omega-CgTx but was insensitive to dihydropyridines. The alpha 1B-1 alpha 2b beta 2-transfected cells displayed a single class of saturable, high-affinity (dissociation constant = 55 pM) omega-CgTx binding sites. Co-expression of the beta 2 subunit was necessary for N-type channel activity, whereas the alpha 2b subunit appeared to modulate the expression of the channel. The heterogeneity of alpha 1B subunits, along with the heterogeneity of alpha 2 and beta subunits, is consistent with multiple, biophysically distinct N-type calcium channels.
Chronic electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve in patients with profound sensori-neural deafness is becoming increasingly routine. Therefore, it is important to understand more about the long-term consequences of this procedure. Hitherto, structural studies in animals after electrocochlear stimulation have concentrated on the stimulated cochlea. Here we have examined the effects of unilateral extracochlear electrical stimulation on the spiral organ of both the ipsilateral and contralateral ears of the mature guinea pig, and have found alterations in the structure of the outer hair cells and their efferent nerve terminals in the contralateral as well as the ipsilateral cochlea. This is the first evidence for a structural influence of efferent activity on the cochlea. Although the importance of the efferent system, consisting of the crossed and uncrossed olivo-cochlear bundles, is well established in providing central control of the sensory pathways, its exact role in hearing is incompletely understood. However, it is known that the outer hair cells and their efferent innervation are important in their contribution to inner hair cell responses and in modulating the micromechanics of the whole cochlea. These efferent functions now appear to be related to an important part of cochlear morphology, and are also relevant to our understanding of cochlear neurobiology, normal development and the management of hearing disability in both adult and child.
Glycine and GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid A) receptors are inhibitory neurotransmitter-gated Cl- channels localized in postsynaptic membranes. In some cases, GABAA receptors are also found presynaptically, but they retain their inhibitory effect as their activation reduces excitatory transmitter release. Here we report evidence for presynaptic ionotropic glycine receptors, using pre- and postsynaptic recordings of a calyceal synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Unlike the classical action of glycine, presynaptic glycine receptors triggered a weakly depolarizing Cl- current in the nerve terminal. The depolarization enhanced transmitter release by activating Ca2+ channels and increasing resting intraterminal Ca2+ concentrations. Repetitive activation of glycinergic synapses on MNTB neurons also enhanced glutamatergic synaptic currents, indicating that presynaptic glycine receptors are activated by glycine spillover. These results reveal a novel site of action of the transmitter glycine, and indicate that under certain conditions presynaptic Cl- channels may increase transmitter release.
Rats were given disulfiram, an inhibitor of norepinephrine biosynthesis, to see if norepinephrine is a transmitter for motivation in electrical stimulation of the brain. Animals given the drug paused in bar pressing, appearing asleep or sedated; if replaced on the bar, they always resumed pressing at normal rates. The decrease in bar pressing may result from a direct or indirect effect of the drug on wakefulness rather than on reward.
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induction of DNA synthesis is believed to involve activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate [I(1,4,5)P3], increase in intracellular Ca2+, activation of protein kinase C (PKC), and receptor down regulation. Generation of these events is triggered by the tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) activity of the PDGF receptor. The TPK inhibitor genistein blocked PDGF induction of these events, including DNA synthesis, with the exception of receptor down regulation. PDGF-induced phosphotyrosine phosphorylations, including receptor autophosphorylation, were inhibited by genistein. Removal of genistein and PDGF resulted in DNA synthesis without the occurrence of PLC activation. These findings indicate that these early events, with the exception of receptor down regulation, are not necessary for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis.
Emotion is normally regulated in the human brain by a complex circuit consisting of the orbital frontal cortex, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and several other interconnected regions. There are both genetic and environmental contributions to the structure and function of this circuitry. We posit that impulsive aggression and violence arise as a consequence of faulty emotion regulation. Indeed, the prefrontal cortex receives a major serotonergic projection, which is dysfunctional in individuals who show impulsive violence. Individuals vulnerable to faulty regulation of negative emotion are at risk for violence and aggression. Research on the neural circuitry of emotion regulation suggests new avenues of intervention for such at-risk populations.
Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive involuntary movements and dementia. The symptoms of the disease, although devastating in severity, do not usually appear until the third to fourth decade of life. The gene defect is highly penetrant, and results in the loss of neurones in the basal ganglia, globus pallidus, and more diffusely in the cortex. A DNA marker, G8 (or D4S10), is tightly linked to Huntington's disease and this gene has been localized to chromosome 4 (ref. 3). The discovery of this linkage marker raises the possibility of developing a presymptomatic test for the disorder, and of eventually isolating the disease gene based on its map position. We have now regionally localized the DNA marker G8 to the terminal band of the short arm of the chromosome, a region representing approximately 0.5% of the total human genome. The assignment was made by examining DNA from patients with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, a birth defect resulting from partial heterozygous deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4.
A20 is a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB pathway and was initially identified as being rapidly induced after tumour-necrosis factor-alpha stimulation. It has a pivotal role in regulation of the immune response and prevents excessive activation of NF-kappaB in response to a variety of external stimuli; recent genetic studies have disclosed putative associations of polymorphic A20 (also called TNFAIP3) alleles with autoimmune disease risk. However, the involvement of A20 in the development of human cancers is unknown. Here we show, using a genome-wide analysis of genetic lesions in 238 B-cell lymphomas, that A20 is a common genetic target in B-lineage lymphomas. A20 is frequently inactivated by somatic mutations and/or deletions in mucosa-associated tissue lymphoma (18 out of 87; 21.8%) and Hodgkin's lymphoma of nodular sclerosis histology (5 out of 15; 33.3%), and, to a lesser extent, in other B-lineage lymphomas. When re-expressed in a lymphoma-derived cell line with no functional A20 alleles, wild-type A20, but not mutant A20, resulted in suppression of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, accompanied by downregulation of NF-kappaB activation. The A20-deficient cells stably generated tumours in immunodeficient mice, whereas the tumorigenicity was effectively suppressed by re-expression of A20. In A20-deficient cells, suppression of both cell growth and NF-kappaB activity due to re-expression of A20 depended, at least partly, on cell-surface-receptor signalling, including the tumour-necrosis factor receptor. Considering the physiological function of A20 in the negative modulation of NF-kappaB activation induced by multiple upstream stimuli, our findings indicate that uncontrolled signalling of NF-kappaB caused by loss of A20 function is involved in the pathogenesis of subsets of B-lineage lymphomas.
The production of red blood cells follows the sequential formation of proerythroblasts and basophilic, polychromatophilic and orthochromatic erythroblasts, and is promoted by the hormone erythropoietin (Epo) in response to tissue hypoxia. However, little is known about the negative regulation of this process. Death receptors are a family of surface molecules that trigger caspase activation and apoptosis in a variety of cell types. Here we show that immature erythroid cells express several death receptors whose ligands are produced by mature erythroblasts. Exposure of erythroid progenitors to mature erythroblasts or death-receptor ligands resulted in caspase-mediated degradation of the transcription factor GATA-1, which is associated with impaired erythroblast development. Expression of a caspase-resistant GATA-1 mutant, but not of the wild-type gene, completely restored erythroid expansion and differentiation following the triggering of death receptors, indicating that there is regulatory feedback between mature and immature erythroblasts through caspase-mediated cleavage of GATA-1. Similarly, erythropoiesis blockade following Epo deprivation was largely prevented by the expression of caspase-inhibitory proteins or caspase-resistant GATA-1 in erythroid progenitors. Caspase-mediated cleavage of GATA-1 may therefore represent an important negative control mechanism in erythropoiesis.
Signaling by the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) involves its release from inhibitor kappa B (IkappaB) in the cytosol, followed by translocation into the nucleus. NF-kappaB regulation of IkappaBalpha transcription represents a delayed negative feedback loop that drives oscillations in NF-kappaB translocation. Single-cell time-lapse imaging and computational modeling of NF-kappaB (RelA) localization showed asynchronous oscillations following cell stimulation that decreased in frequency with increased IkappaBalpha transcription. Transcription of target genes depended on oscillation persistence, involving cycles of RelA phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The functional consequences of NF-kappaB signaling may thus depend on number, period, and amplitude of oscillations.
In a variety of neurological syndromes, patients may show tacit awareness of stimuli that cannot be consciously recollected or identified. Such dissociations are the defining characteristic of 'blindsight'; comparable phenomena are seen in some patients with amnesia and some with prosopagnosia, a profound impairment of familiar face recognition. We report here an analogous dissociation between overt and covert perception in a case of visuo-spatial neglect. The patient, P.S., had sustained right cerebral damage and failed overtly to process information in the hemispace contralateral to lesion. In common with most patients who manifest left-sided neglect, P.S. has a left homonymous hemianopia. Nonetheless, her neglect persists despite free movement of the head and eyes and is thus not a direct consequence of sensory loss in the left visual field. P.S. was presented simultaneously with two line drawings of a house, in one of which the left side was on fire. She judged that the drawings were identical; yet when asked to select which house she would prefer to live in, she reliably chose the house that was not burning.
Transcription factor binding sites are being discovered at a rapid pace. It is now necessary to turn attention towards understanding how these sites work in combination to influence gene expression. Quantitative models that accurately predict gene expression from promoter sequence will be a crucial part of solving this problem. Here we present such a model, based on the analysis of synthetic promoter libraries in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Thermodynamic models based only on the equilibrium binding of transcription factors to DNA and to each other captured a large fraction of the variation in expression in every library. Thermodynamic analysis of these libraries uncovered several phenomena in our system, including cooperativity and the effects of weak binding sites. When applied to the S. cerevisiae genome, a model of repression by Mig1 (which was trained on synthetic promoters) predicts a number of Mig1-regulated genes that lack significant Mig1-binding sites in their promoters. The success of the thermodynamic approach suggests that the information encoded by combinations of cis-regulatory sites is interpreted primarily through simple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, with complicated biochemical reactions-such as nucleosome modifications-being downstream events. Quantitative analyses of synthetic promoter libraries will be an important tool in unravelling the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation.
We report here the use of positron emission tomography (PET) to reveal that the primary visual cortex is activated when subjects close their eyes and visualize objects. The size of the image is systematically related to the location of maximal activity, which is as expected because the earliest visual areas are spatially organized. These results were only evident, however, when imagery conditions were compared to a non-imagery baseline in which the same auditory cues were presented (and hence the stimuli were controlled); when a resting baseline was used (and hence brain activation was uncontrolled), imagery activation was obscured because of activation in visual cortex during the baseline condition. These findings resolve a debate in the literature about whether imagery activates early visual cortex and indicate that visual mental imagery involves 'depictive' representations, not solely language-like descriptions. Moreover, the fact that stored visual information can affect processing in even the earliest visual areas suggests that knowledge can fundamentally bias what one sees.
In an effort to find new pharmacological modalities to overcome resistance to ATP-binding-site inhibitors of Bcr-Abl, we recently reported the discovery of GNF-2, a selective allosteric Bcr-Abl inhibitor. Here, using solution NMR, X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis and hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry, we show that GNF-2 binds to the myristate-binding site of Abl, leading to changes in the structural dynamics of the ATP-binding site. GNF-5, an analogue of GNF-2 with improved pharmacokinetic properties, when used in combination with the ATP-competitive inhibitors imatinib or nilotinib, suppressed the emergence of resistance mutations in vitro, displayed additive inhibitory activity in biochemical and cellular assays against T315I mutant human Bcr-Abl and displayed in vivo efficacy against this recalcitrant mutant in a murine bone-marrow transplantation model. These results show that therapeutically relevant inhibition of Bcr-Abl activity can be achieved with inhibitors that bind to the myristate-binding site and that combining allosteric and ATP-competitive inhibitors can overcome resistance to either agent alone.
Figures in which human observers perceive "illusory contours" were found to evoke responses in cells of area 18 in the visual cortex of alert monkeys. The cells responded as if the contours were formed by real lines or edges. Modifications that weakened the perception of contours also reduced the neuronal responses. In contrast, cells in area 17 were apparently unable to "see" these contours.
RNA transcripts from chromatin of S phase but not G1 cells contain histone-specific sequences. Chromatin reconstituted with S phase non-histone chromosomal proteins transcribes histone messenger RNA sequences whereas chromatin reconstituted with G1 non-histone proteins does not. These results suggest that transcription of histone genes is regulated during the cell cycle and that non-histone proteins have a key role in this regulation.
In many regions of the cerebral cortex, Ca2+ influx through NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) sensitive glutamate receptors (NMDA receptors) can trigger two forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP). LTD is induced by low levels of postsynaptic NMDA-receptor activation, for instance in response to low-frequency stimulation, whereas LTP is induced by the stronger activation that occurs following high-frequency stimulation. Theoretical studies have shown that the properties of synaptic LTD and LTP can account for many aspects of experience-dependent plasticity in the developing visual cortex, provided that the LTD-LTP crossover point (the modification threshold, theta(m)) varies as a function of the history of cortical activity. Here we provide direct experimental evidence that the value of theta(m) depends on sensory experience. We find in visual cortex of light-deprived rats that LTP is enhanced and LTD diminished over a range of stimulation frequencies, and that these effects can be reversed by as little as two days of light exposure. Our findings support the idea that a variable synaptic modification threshold allows synaptic weights in neural networks to achieve a stable equilibrium.
Microinfusions of rat prolactin into the dorsal midbrain of estrogen-treated, ovariectomized rats increased lordosis behavior. Midbrain microinfusions of antiserum to prolactin into rats displaying maximum lordosis had the opposite effect. The distribution of a prolactin-like substance in the brain was studied immunocytochemically. The results suggest that a hypothalamic neuronal system projecting to the midbrain contains a prolactin-like substance that plays a role in facilitating this behavior and therefore may mediate some of the effects of estrogen on the brain. These data, together with others from studies of the prolactin gene and its regulation, indicate that it may be possible to analyze a sequence of molecular events in the brain that facilitate a behavioral response.
The migration of postmitotic neurons away from compact, germinal zones is a critical step in neuronal differentiation in the developing brain. To study the molecular signals necessary for cerebellar granule cell migration in situ, precursor cells from the neurological mutant mouse weaver, an animal with phenotypic defects in migration, were implanted into the external germinal layer (EGL) of wild-type cerebellar cortex. In this region, labeled weaver precursor cells of the EGL progressed through all stages of granule neuron differentiation, including the extension of parallel fibers, migration through the molecular and Purkinje cell layers, positioning in the internal granule cell layer, and extension of dendrites. Thus, the weaver gene acts nonautonomously in vivo, and local cell interactions may induce early steps in neuronal differentiation that are required for granule cell migration.
Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder that results from degeneration of striatal neurons, particularly those containing GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). There is no effective treatment for preventing or slowing this neuronal degeneration. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a trophic factor for striatal neurons and therefore a potential therapeutic agent for Huntington's disease. Here we evaluate CNTF as a neuroprotective agent in a nonhuman primate model of Huntington's disease. We gave cynomolgus monkeys intrastriatal implants of polymer-encapsulated baby hamster kidney fibroblasts that had been genetically modified to secrete human CNTF. One week later, monkeys received unilateral injections of quinolinic acid into the previously implanted striatum to reproduce the neuropathology seen in Huntington's disease. Human CNTF was found to exert a neuroprotective effect on several populations of striatal cells, including GABAergic, cholinergic and diaphorase-positive neurons which were all destined to die following administration of quinolinic acid. Human CNTF also prevented the retrograde atrophy of layer V neurons in motor cortex and exerted a significant protective effect on the GABAergic innervation of the two important target fields of the striatal output neurons (the globus pallidus and pars reticulata of the substantia nigra). Our results show that human CNTF has a trophic influence on degenerating striatal neurons as well as on critical non-striatal regions such as the cerebral cortex, supporting the idea that human CNTF may help to prevent the degeneration of vulnerable striatal populations and cortical-striatal basal ganglia circuits in Huntington's disease.
Thyroid hormone is important in the regulation of synthesis and secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the anterior pituitary, but its role in the control of hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is controversial. To determine whether thyroid hormone regulates the function of TRH in the hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular system, a study was made of the effect of hypothyroidism on thyrotropin-releasing hormone messenger RNA (proTRH mRNA) and TRH prohormone in the rat paraventricular nucleus. Extracts of rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus were examined by quantitative Northern blot analysis, and coronal sections of rat brain were examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunocytochemistry. A nearly twofold increase in proTRH mRNA was observed in hypothyroid animals; this increase could be obliterated by levothyroxine treatment, suggesting an inverse relation between circulating thyroid hormone and proTRH mRNA. In situ hybridization showed that this response occurred exclusively in medial parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus. A simultaneous increase in proTRH mRNA and immunoreactive TRH prohormone in this region suggests that hypothyroidism induces both transcription and translation of the TRH prohormone in the paraventricular nucleus.
A decision is a commitment to a proposition or plan of action based on evidence and the expected costs and benefits associated with the outcome. Progress in a variety of fields has led to a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms that evaluate evidence and reach a decision. Several formalisms propose that a representation of noisy evidence is evaluated against a criterion to produce a decision. Without additional evidence, however, these formalisms fail to explain why a decision-maker would change their mind. Here we extend a model, developed to account for both the timing and the accuracy of the initial decision, to explain subsequent changes of mind. Subjects made decisions about a noisy visual stimulus, which they indicated by moving a handle. Although they received no additional information after initiating their movement, their hand trajectories betrayed a change of mind in some trials. We propose that noisy evidence is accumulated over time until it reaches a criterion level, or bound, which determines the initial decision, and that the brain exploits information that is in the processing pipeline when the initial decision is made to subsequently either reverse or reaffirm the initial decision. The model explains both the frequency of changes of mind as well as their dependence on both task difficulty and whether the initial decision was accurate or erroneous. The theoretical and experimental findings advance the understanding of decision-making to the highly flexible and cognitive acts of vacillation and self-correction.
The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from fish electric organ and mammalian skeletal muscle is the best characterized neurotransmitter receptor (reviewed in refs 1-3). The AChR from the electroplax of the ray Torpedo californica consists of five subunits present in a molar stoichiometry of alpha 2 beta gamma delta (refs 4-6); the apparent molecular weights of the alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-subunits are 40,000 (40K), 50K, 60K and 65K, respectively. Knowledge of the primary structures of these constituent polypeptides would facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the function of the neurotransmitter receptor. Recently, we have cloned cDNA for the alpha-subunit precursor of the T. californica AChR and have deduced the primary structure of this polypeptide from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA. Here we report the cloning and nucleotide analysis of cDNAs for the AChR beta- and delta-subunit precursors. The primary structures of the two polypeptides deduced from the cDNA sequences reveal conspicuous amino acid sequence homology among these and the alpha-subunits. The three subunits contain several highly conserved regions which may be essential for the receptor function or inter-subunit interaction.
The function of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-preferring glutamate receptor can be regulated by extracellular pH, a process that may be important during ischemia in the brain or during seizures. Protons inhibit NMDA receptor function by 50 percent at pH 7.3 through interactions with the NR1 subunit, and both polyamines and NR1 exon 5 potentiate receptor function through relief of the tonic proton inhibition present at physiological pH. A single amino acid (lysine 211) was identified that mediates the effects of exon 5 in the rat brain. Electroneutral substitutions at this position restored pH sensitivity and, consequently, polyamine relief of tonic inhibition. This effect, together with the structural similarities between polyamines and the surface loop encoded by exon 5, suggest that exon 5 may act as a tethered pH-sensitive constitutive modulator of NMDA receptor function.
The flow of neural signals within the cerebral cortex must be subject to multiple controls as behaviour unfolds in time. In a visual discrimination task that includes a delay period, the transmission of sensory signals to circuitry that mediates memory, decision-making and motor-planning must be governed closely by 'filtering' or 'gating' mechanisms so that extraneous events occurring before, during or after presentation of the critical visual stimulus have little or no effect on the subject's behavioural responses. Here we study one such mechanism physiologically by applying electrical microstimulation to columns of directionally selective neurons in the middle temporal visual area at varying times during single trials of a direction-discrimination task. The behavioural effects of microstimulation varied strikingly according to the timing of delivery within the trial, indicating that signals produced by microstimulation may be subject to active 'gating'. Our results show several important features of this gating process: first, signal flow is modulated upwards on onset of the visual stimulus and downwards, typically with a slower time course, after stimulus offset; second, gating efficacy can be modified by behavioural training; and third, gating is implemented primarily downstream of the middle temporal visual area.
The mechanism by which psychostimulants act as calming agents in humans with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or hyperkinetic disorder is currently unknown. Mice lacking the gene encoding the plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT) have elevated dopaminergic tone and are hyperactive. This activity was exacerbated by exposure to a novel environment. Additionally, these mice were impaired in spatial cognitive function, and they showed a decrease in locomotion in response to psychostimulants. This paradoxical calming effect of psychostimulants depended on serotonergic neurotransmission. The parallels between the DAT knockout mice and individuals with ADHD suggest that common mechanisms may underlie some of their behaviors and responses to psychostimulants.
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the mechanism by which cholinergic enhancement improves working memory. We studied the effect of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine on subcomponents of this complex function. Cholinergic enhancement increased the selectivity of neural responses in extrastriate cortices during visual working memory, particularly during encoding. It also increased the participation of ventral extrastriate cortex during memory maintenance and decreased the participation of anterior prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that cholinergic enhancement improves memory performance by augmenting the selectivity of perceptual processing during encoding, thereby simplifying processing demands during memory maintenance and reducing the need for prefrontal participation.
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors that is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, adrenal gland and spleen. PPAR-gamma has been demonstrated to regulate adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis in response to several structurally distinct compounds, including thiazolidinediones and fibrates. Naturally occurring compounds such as fatty acids and the prostaglandin D2 metabolite 15-deoxy-delta prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) bind to PPAR-gamma and stimulate transcription of target genes. Prostaglandin D2 metabolites have not yet been identified in adipose tissue, but are major products of arachidonic-acid metabolism in macrophages, raising the possibility that they might serve as endogenous PPAR-gamma ligands in this cell type. Here we show that PPAR-gamma is markedly upregulated in activated macrophages and inhibits the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase, gelatinase B and scavenger receptor A genes in response to 15d-PGJ2 and synthetic PPAR-gamma ligands. PPAR-gamma inhibits gene expression in part by antagonizing the activities of the transcription factors AP-1, STAT and NF-kappaB. These observations suggest that PPAR-gamma and locally produced prostaglandin D2 metabolites are involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses, and raise the possibility that synthetic PPAR-gamma ligands may be of therapeutic value in human diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis in which activated macrophages exert pathogenic effects.
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cerebral deposits of amyloid beta-protein (AP) as senile plaque core and vascular amyloid, and a complementary DNA encoding a precursor of this protein (APP) has been cloned from human brain. From a cDNA library of a human glioblastoma cell line, we have isolated a cDNA identical to that previously reported, together with a new cDNA which contains a 225-nucleotide insert. The sequence of the 56 amino acids at the N-terminal of the protein deduced from this insert is highly homologous to the basic trypsin inhibitor family, and the lysate from COS-1 cells transfected with the longer APP cDNA showed an increased inhibition of trypsin activity. Partial sequencing of the genomic DNA encoding APP showed that the 225 nucleotides are located in two exons. At least three messenger RNA species, apparently transcribed from a single APP gene by alternative splicing, were found in human brain. We suggest that protease inhibition by the longer APP(s) could be related to aberrant APP catabolism.
Intraoperative electrical stimulation, which temporarily inactivates restricted regions during brain surgery, can map cognitive functions in humans with spatiotemporal resolution unmatched by other methods. Using this technique, we found that stimulation of the right inferior parietal lobule or the caudal superior temporal gyrus, but not of its rostral portion, determined rightward deviations on line bisection. However, the strongest shifts occurred with subcortical stimulation. Fiber tracking identified the stimulated site as a section of the superior occipitofrontal fasciculus, a poorly known parietal-frontal pathway. These findings suggest that parietal-frontal communication is necessary for the symmetrical processing of the visual scene.
Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission could be a mechanism underlying memory. Induction of LTP requires Ca2+ influx into postsynaptic neurons through ion channels gated by NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors in hippocampus (area CA1 and dentate gyrus) and neocortex. Here we report that a component of LTP not requiring the activation of NMDA receptors can be induced in area CA1. The component is dependent on tetanus frequency, requires increases in postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and is suppressed by an antagonist of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.
Pathfinding by growing axons in the developing nervous system may be guided by gradients of extracellular guidance factors. Analogous to the process of chemotaxis in microorganisms, we found that axonal growth cones of cultured Xenopus spinal neurons exhibit adaptation during chemotactic migration, undergoing consecutive phases of desensitization and resensitization in the presence of increasing basal concentrations of the guidance factor netrin-1 or brain-derived neurotrophic factor. The desensitization is specific to the guidance factor and is accompanied by a reduction of Ca2+ signalling, whereas resensitization requires activation of mitogen-associated protein kinase and local protein synthesis. Such adaptive behaviour allows the growth cone to re-adjust its sensitivity over a wide range of concentrations of the guidance factor, an essential feature for long-range chemotaxis.
A question of long-standing interest to philosophers, psychologists and neuroscientists is how the brain selects which signals enter consciousness. Binocular rivalry and attention both involve selection of visual stimuli, but affect perception quite differently. During binocular rivalry, awareness alternates between two different stimuli presented to the two eyes. In contrast, attending to one of two different stimuli impairs discrimination of the ignored stimulus, but without causing it to disappear from consciousness. Here we show that despite this difference, attention and rivalry rely on shared object-based selection mechanisms. We cued attention to one of two superimposed transparent surfaces and then deleted the image of one surface from each eye, resulting in rivalry. Observers usually reported seeing only the cued surface. They were also less accurate in judging unpredictable changes in the features of the uncued surface. Our design ensured that selection of the cued surface could not have resulted from spatial, ocular or feature-based mechanisms. Rather, attention was drawn to one surface, and this caused the other surface to be perceptually suppressed during rivalry. These results raise the question of how object representations compete during these two forms of perceptual selection, even as the features of those objects change unpredictably over time.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially lethal condition in which sustained muscle contracture, with attendant hypercatabolic reactions and elevation in body temperature, are triggered by commonly used inhalational anaesthetics and skeletal muscle relaxants. In humans, the trait is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, but in halothane-sensitive pigs with a similar phenotype, inheritance of the disease is autosomal recessive or co-dominant. A simple and accurate non-invasive test for the gene is not available and predisposition to the disease is currently determined through a halothane- and/or caffeine-induced contracture test on a skeletal muscle biopsy. Because Ca2+ is the chief regulator of muscle contraction and metabolism, the primary defect in MH is believed to lie in Ca2+ regulation. Indeed, several studies indicate a defect in the Ca2+ release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, making it a prime candidate for the altered gene product in predisposed individuals. We have recently cloned complementary DNA and genomic DNA encoding the human ryanodine receptor (the Ca2(+)-release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum) and mapped the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR) to region q13.1 of human chromosome 19 (ref. 14), in close proximity to genetic markers that have been shown to map near the MH susceptibility locus in humans and the halothane-sensitive gene in pigs. As a more definitive test of whether the RYR gene is a candidate gene for the human MH phenotype, we have carried out a linkage study with MH families to determine whether the MH phenotype segregates with chromosome 19q markers, including markers in the RYR gene. Co-segregation of MH with RYR markers, resulting in a lod score of 4.20 at a linkage distance of zero centimorgans, indicates that MH is likely to be caused by mutations in the RYR gene.
Intention is central to the concept of voluntary action. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared conditions in which participants made self-paced actions and attended either to their intention to move or to the actual movement. When they attended to their intention rather than their movement, there was an enhancement of activity in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). We also found activations in the right dorsal prefrontal cortex and left intraparietal cortex. Prefrontal activity, but not parietal activity, was more strongly coupled with activity in the pre-SMA. We conclude that activity in the pre-SMA reflects the representation of intention.
The coordination of somatic cell division with cell size must be accomplished by the accumulation of mitotic inducers or the dilution, in the course of cell growth, of mitotic inhibitors. In fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), cell size at mitosis is determined by expression of the cdc25+ and nim1+ inducer genes and of the inhibitor gene wee1+, which between them regulate the M-phase protein kinase p34cdc2. We now report that both the phosphoprotein product of cdc25+ (p80cdc25, with apparent relative molecular mass 80,000) and the corresponding messenger RNA increase in concentration as cells proceed through interphase, peaking at mitosis. We propose that the cell-cycle timing of mitosis in somatic cells is regulated by the cyclic accumulation of the cdc25 mitotic inducer, which on reaching a critical level results in activation of p34cdc2 protein kinase. Accumulation of this inducer could play a part in coordinating cell division with growth.
The extent of gene regulation in cell differentiation is poorly understood. We previously used saturation mutagenesis to identify 18 genes that are needed for the development and function of a single type of sensory neuron--the touch receptor neuron for gentle touch in Caenorhabditis elegans. One of these genes, mec-3, encodes a transcription factor that controls touch receptor differentiation. By culturing and isolating wild-type and mec-3 mutant cells from embryos and applying their amplified RNA to DNA microarrays, here we have identified genes that are known to be expressed in touch receptors, a previously uncloned gene (mec-17) that is needed for maintaining touch receptor differentiation, and more than 50 previously unknown mec-3-dependent genes. These genes are randomly distributed in the genome and under-represented both for genes that are co-expressed in operons and for multiple members of gene families. Using regions 5' of the start codon of the first 20 genes, we have also identified an over-represented heptanucleotide, AATGCAT, that is needed for the expression of touch receptor genes.
JNPL3 transgenic mice expressing a mutant tau protein, which develop neurofibrillary tangles and progressive motor disturbance, were crossed with Tg2576 transgenic mice expressing mutant beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), thus modulating the APP-Abeta (beta-amyloid peptide) environment. The resulting double mutant (tau/APP) progeny and the Tg2576 parental strain developed Abeta deposits at the same age; however, relative to JNPL3 mice, the double mutants exhibited neurofibrillary tangle pathology that was substantially enhanced in the limbic system and olfactory cortex. These results indicate that either APP or Abeta influences the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The interaction between Abeta and tau pathologies in these mice supports the hypothesis that a similar interaction occurs in Alzheimer's disease.
Many voluntary movements involve coordination between the limbs. However, there have been very few attempts to study the neuronal mechanisms that mediate this coordination. Here we have studied the activity of cortical neurons while monkeys performed tasks that required coordination between the two arms. We found that most neurons in the primary motor cortex (MI) show activity specific to bimanual movements (bimanual-related activity), which is strikingly different from the activity of the same neurons during unimanual movements. Moreover, units in the supplementary motor area (SMA; the area of cortex most often associated with bimanual coordination) showed no more bimanual-related activity than units in MI. Our results challenge the classic view that MI controls the contralateral (opposite) side of the body and that SMA is responsible for the coordination of the arms. Rather, our data suggest that both cortical areas share the control of bilateral coordination.
Although most examples of modulation of synaptic transmission have been obtained from excitatory rather than from inhibitory connections, serotonin (5HT) is now shown to cause a presynaptic facilitation of release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine. Brief local injections of this amine, or application of a 5HT uptake blocker, produce a long-lasting enhancement of both spontaneous and evoked inhibitory currents in the teleost Mauthner cell. Quantal analysis showed that the probability of release is increased. Focal recording indicated that 5HT acts directly on the inhibitory terminals, possibly reducing potassium conductances. Double staining with specific antibodies demonstrated a morphological substrate for this effect. Nerve endings that contain 5HT contact inhibitory terminals directly apposed to postsynaptic glycine receptors.
Zebrafish cyclops (cyc) mutations cause deficiencies in the dorsal mesendoderm and ventral neural tube, leading to neural defects and cyclopia. Here we report that cyc encodes a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-related intercellular signalling molecule that is similar to mouse nodal. cyc is expressed in dorsal mesendoderm at gastrulation and in the prechordal plate until early somitogenesis. Expression reappears transiently in the left lateral-plate mesoderm, and in an unprecedented asymmetric pattern in the left forebrain. Injection of cyc RNA non-autonomously restores sonic hedgehog-expressing cells of the ventral brain and floorplate that are absent in cyc mutants, whereas inducing activities are abolished by cyc, a mutation of a conserved cysteine in the mature ligand. Our results indicate that cyc provides an essential non-cell-autonomous signal at gastrulation, leading to induction of the floorplate and ventral brain.
The protein N-WASP [a homolog to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)] regulates actin polymerization by stimulating the actin-nucleating activity of the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex. N-WASP is tightly regulated by multiple signals: Only costimulation by Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) yields potent polymerization. We found that regulation requires N-WASP's constitutively active output domain (VCA) and two regulatory domains: a Cdc42-binding domain and a previously undescribed PIP(2)-binding domain. In the absence of stimuli, the regulatory modules together hold the VCA-Arp2/3 complex in an inactive "closed" conformation. In this state, both the Cdc42- and PIP2-binding sites are masked. Binding of either input destabilizes the closed state and enhances binding of the other input. This cooperative activation mechanism shows how combinations of simple binding domains can be used to integrate and amplify coincident signals.
Rhythmic changes in histone acetylation at circadian clock genes suggest that temporal modulation of gene expression is regulated by chromatin modifications. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate a critical relationship between circadian and metabolic physiology. The nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (Ncor1) functions as an activating subunit for the chromatin modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3). Lack of Ncor1 is incompatible with life, and hence it is unknown whether Ncor1, and particularly its regulation of Hdac3, is critical for adult mammalian physiology. Here we show that specific, genetic disruption of the Ncor1-Hdac3 interaction in mice causes aberrant regulation of clock genes and results in abnormal circadian behaviour. These mice are also leaner and more insulin-sensitive owing to increased energy expenditure. Unexpectedly, loss of a functional Ncor1-Hdac3 complex in vivo does not lead to sustained increases in known catabolic genes, but instead significantly alters the oscillatory patterns of several metabolic genes, demonstrating that circadian regulation of metabolism is critical for normal energy balance. These findings indicate that activation of Hdac3 by Ncor1 is a nodal point in the epigenetic regulation of circadian and metabolic physiology.
Simulations were performed of layers I and II of olfactory paleocortex, as connected to its primary input structure, olfactory bulb. Induction of synaptic long-term potentiation by means of repetitive sampling of inputs caused the simulation to organize encodings of learned cues into a hierarchical memory that uncovered statistical relationships in the cue environment, corresponding to the performance of hierarchical clustering by the biological network. Simplification led to characterization of those parts of the network responsible for the mechanism, resulting in a novel, efficient algorithm for hierarchical clustering. The hypothesis is put forward that these corticobulbar networks and circuitry of similar design in other brain regions contain computational elements sufficient to construct perceptual hierarchies for use in recognizing environmental cues.
Autologous peripheral nerve grafts were used to permit and direct the regrowth of retinal ganglion cell axons from the eye to the ipsilateral superior colliculus of adult hamsters in which the optic nerves had been transected within the orbit. Extracellular recordings in the superior colliculus 15 to 18 weeks after graft insertion revealed excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses to visual stimulation. The finding of light-induced responses in neurons in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus close to the graft indicates that axons regenerating from axotomized retinal ganglion cells can establish electrophysiologically functional synapses with neurons in the superior colliculus of these adult mammals.
The eye functions effectively over an enormous range of ambient illumination, because retinal sensitivity can be adapted to prevailing light levels. Higher order neurones in the visual pathway are presumably more concerned with relative changes in illumination, that is, contrast, because a great deal of information concerning absolute light level is processed at the retinal level. It would therefore be of considerable functional value if cells in the visual cortex could adapt their response levels to a steady-state ambient contrast, in a manner analogous to the sensitivity control mechanism of the retina. We have examined here the idea that adaptation of neurones in the visual cortex to ambient contrast is similar to adaptation in the retina to ambient illumination. The experiments were performed by measuring contrast response functions (response amplitude as a function of contrast) of striate neurones, while systematically adapting them to different contrast levels. Our results show that, for the majority of cortical neurones, response-contrast curves are laterally shifted along a log-contrast axis so that the effective domains of neurones are adjusted to match prevailing contrast levels. This contrast gain control mechanism, which was not observed for lateral geniculate (LGN) fibres, must be of prime importance to visual function.
Direction-selective neurons in the rabbit lateral geniculate nucleus signal movement-direction more precisely than their retinal counterparts. This increased selectivity arises from the interaction of retinal inputs to the geniculate cell. A direction-selective geniculate neuron is fed by at least two retinal direction-selective cells, whose preferred directions are 180 degrees apart. One retinal input is excitatory to the geniculate cell and the other is inhibitory.
The drug sensitivities of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates from a group of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) who were receiving zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoythymidine, AZT) therapy were tested by means of a newly developed plaque assay in CD4+ HeLa cells. Fifty percent inhibitory dose (ID50) values of 18 isolates from untreated individuals ranged between 0.01 microM and 0.05 microM. In contrast, most isolates from patients who had received zidovudine for 6 months or more exhibited decreased sensitivity characterized by changes in ID50 or ID95 values (or both), with isolates from several patients (5/15) showing 100-fold increases in ID50. The latter isolates were also insensitive to 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine; however, the isolates were still sensitive to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine, or phosphonoformate. It cannot be determined from this small sample of patients whether development of a less sensitive virus phenotype results in clinical resistance. Appearance of such variants was not associated with a consistent increase in viral p24 concentrations in patient plasma and did not herald any sudden deterioration in clinical status. More extensive studies are required to determine the clinical significance. Thus, it would be premature to alter any treatment protocols for HIV-infected individuals at present.
Three distinct classes of drugs: dopaminergic agonists (such as D-amphetamine), serotonergic agonists (such as LSD), and glutamatergic antagonists (such as PCP) all induce psychotomimetic states in experimental animals that closely resemble schizophrenia symptoms in humans. Here we implicate a common signaling pathway in mediating these effects. In this pathway, dopamine- and an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated phospho-protein of 32 kilodaltons (DARPP-32) is phosphorylated or dephosphorylated at three sites, in a pattern predicted to cause a synergistic inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 and concomitant regulation of its downstream effector proteins glycogen synthesis kinase-3 (GSK-3), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and c-Fos. In mice with a genetic deletion of DARPP-32 or with point mutations in phosphorylation sites of DARPP-32, the effects of D-amphetamine, LSD, and PCP on two behavioral parameters-sensorimotor gating and repetitive movements-were strongly attenuated.
Optical imaging of animal somatosensory, olfactory and visual cortices has revealed maps of functional activity. In non-human primates, high-resolution maps of the visual cortex have been obtained using only an intrinsic reflection signal. Although the time course of the signal is slower than membrane potential changes, the maximum optical changes correspond to the maximal neuronal activity. The intrinsic optical signal may represent the flow of ionic currents, oxygen delivery, changes in blood volume, potassium accumulation or glial swelling. Here we use similar techniques to obtain maps from human cortex during stimulation-evoked epileptiform afterdischarges and cognitively evoked functional activity. Optical changes increased in magnitude as the intensity and duration of the afterdischarges increased. In areas surrounding the afterdischarge activity, optical changes were in the opposite direction and possibly represent an inhibitory surround. Large optical changes were found in the sensory cortex during tongue movement and in Broca's and Wernicke's language areas during naming exercises. The adaptation of high-resolution optical imaging for use on human cortex provides a new technique for investigation of the organization of the sensory and motor cortices, language, and other cognitive processes.
Mammalian sympathetic neurons in vivo may express either a noradrenergic or cholinergic phenotype. In view of the opposing effect of noradrenaline and acetylcholine on most autonomic target organs, the target-appropriate expression of neurotransmitter is critical. We have examined the maturation of the sympathetic innervation of rat sweat glands to define the developmental mechanisms regulating neurotransmitter choice in vivo. Eccrine sweat glands and their sympathetic innervation develop together postnatally in the rat. Early postnatal innervation expresses only noradrenergic properties, but as the glands and their innervation mature, noradrenergic properties decrease dramatically and cholinergic features appear in the same population of neurons. To investigate the role of the sweat gland in this change we have used a transplantation paradigm which allows sweat glands to be innervated by sympathetic neurons that would normally innervate noradrenergic target organs and remain noradrenergic throughout life. We observe that the sympathetic neurons that innervate the novel cholinergic target alter their neurotransmitter properties and develop a cholinergic phenotype. These results indicate that target organs are able to induce appropriate neurotransmitter traits in the neurons that innervate them.
During normal development of the vertebrate nervous system, large numbers of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system undergo naturally occurring cell death. For example, about half of all spinal motor neurons die over a period of a few days in developing avian, rat and mouse embryos. Previous studies have shown that extracts from muscle and brain, secreted factors from glia, as well as several growth factors and neurotrophic agents, including muscle-derived factors, can promote the survival of developing motor neurons in vitro and in vivo. But because neurotrophins and other known trophic agents administered alone or in combination are insufficient to rescue all developing motor neurons from cell death, other neurotrophic molecules are probably essential for the survival and differentiation of motor neurons. Here we report that glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a potent neurotrophic factor that enhances survival of mammalian midbrain dopaminergic neurons, rescues developing avian motor neurons from natural programmed cell death in vivo and promotes the survival of enriched populations of cultured motor neurons. Furthermore, treatment with this agent in vivo also prevents the induced death and atrophy of both avian and mouse spinal motor neurons following peripheral axotomy.
The ability to shift between different behavioral strategies is necessary for appropriate decision-making. Here, we show that chronic stress biases decision-making strategies, affecting the ability of stressed animals to perform actions on the basis of their consequences. Using two different operant tasks, we revealed that, in making choices, rats subjected to chronic stress became insensitive to changes in outcome value and resistant to changes in action-outcome contingency. Furthermore, chronic stress caused opposing structural changes in the associative and sensorimotor corticostriatal circuits underlying these different behavioral strategies, with atrophy of medial prefrontal cortex and the associative striatum and hypertrophy of the sensorimotor striatum. These data suggest that the relative advantage of circuits coursing through sensorimotor striatum observed after chronic stress leads to a bias in behavioral strategies toward habit.
Neuropeptides, critical brain peptides that modulate animal behavior by affecting the activity of almost every neuronal circuit, are inherently difficult to predict directly from a nascent genome sequence because of extensive posttranslational processing. The combination of bioinformatics and proteomics allows unprecedented neuropeptide discovery from an unannotated genome. Within the Apis mellifera genome, we have inferred more than 200 neuropeptides and have confirmed the sequences of 100 peptides. This study lays the groundwork for future molecular studies of Apis neuropeptides with the identification of 36 genes, 33 of which were previously unreported.
Target cell lysis is regulated by natural killer (NK) cell receptors that recognize class I MHC molecules. Here we report the crystal structure of the human immunoglobulin-like NK cell receptor KIR2DL2 in complex with its class I ligand HLA-Cw3 and peptide. KIR binds in a nearly orthogonal orientation across the alpha1 and alpha2 helices of Cw3 and directly contacts positions 7 and 8 of the peptide. No significant conformational changes in KIR occur on complex formation. The receptor footprint on HLA overlaps with but is distinct from that of the T-cell receptor. Charge complementarity dominates the KIR/HLA interface and mutations that disrupt interface salt bridges substantially diminish binding. Most contacts in the complex are between KIR and conserved HLA-C residues, but a hydrogen bond between Lys 44 of KIR2DL2 and Asn 80 of Cw3 confers the allotype specificity. KIR contact requires position 8 of the peptide to be a residue smaller than valine. A second KIR/HLA interface produced an ordered receptor-ligand aggregation in the crystal which may resemble receptor clustering during immune synapse formation.
In cancer, the biochemical pathways that are dominated by the two tumour-suppressor proteins, p53 and Rb, are the most frequently disrupted. Cyclin D-dependent kinases phosphorylate Rb to control its activity and they are, in turn, specifically inhibited by the Ink4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) which cause arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Mutations in Rb, cyclin D1, its catalytic subunit Cdk4, and the CDKI p16Ink4a, which alter the protein or its level of expression, are all strongly implicated in cancer. This suggests that the Rb 'pathway' is of particular importance. Here we report the structure of the p19Ink4d protein, determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure indicates that most mutations to the p16Ink4a gene, which result in loss of function, are due to incorrectly folded and/or insoluble proteins. We propose a model for the interaction of Ink4 proteins with D-type cyclin-Cdk4/6 complexes that might provide a basis for the design of therapeutics against cancer. The sequences of the Ink4 family of CDKIs are highly conserved
Evolution of gene regulation is an important contributor to the variety of life. Here, we analyse the evolution of a combinatorial transcriptional circuit composed of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that are conserved among all eukaryotes. This circuit regulates mating in the ascomycete yeast lineage. We first identify a group of mating genes that was transcriptionally regulated by an activator in a fungal ancestor, but is now transcriptionally regulated by a repressor in modern bakers' yeast. Despite this change in regulatory mechanism, the logical output of the overall circuit remains the same. By examining the regulation of mating in modern yeasts that are related to different extents, we deduce specific, sequential changes in both cis- and trans-regulatory elements that constitute the transition from positive to negative regulation. These changes indicate specific mechanisms by which fitness barriers were traversed during the transition.
Lissencephaly (agyria-pachygyria) is a human brain malformation manifested by a smooth cerebral surface and abnormal neuronal migration. Identification of the gene(s) involved in this disorder would facilitate molecular dissection of normal events in brain development. Type 1 lissencephaly occurs either as an isolated abnormality or in association with dysmorphic facial appearance in patients with Miller-Dieker syndrome. About 15% of patients with isolated lissencephaly and more than 90% of patients with Miller-Dieker syndrome have microdeletions in a critical 350-kilobase region in chromosome 17p13.3 (ref. 6). These deletions are hemizygous, so haplo-insufficiency for a gene in this interval is implicated. Here we report the cloning of a gene (LIS-1, lissencephaly-1) in 17p13.3 that is deleted in Miller-Dieker patients. Non-overlapping deletions involving either the 5' or 3' end of the gene were found in two patients, identifying LIS-1 as the disease gene. The deduced amino-acid sequence shows significant homology to beta-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, suggesting that it could possibly be involved in a signal transduction pathway crucial for cerebral development.
Positive reinforcement helps to control the acquisition of learned behaviours. Here we report a cellular mechanism in the brain that may underlie the behavioural effects of positive reinforcement. We used intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) as a model of reinforcement learning, in which each rat learns to press a lever that applies reinforcing electrical stimulation to its own substantia nigra. The outputs from neurons of the substantia nigra terminate on neurons in the striatum in close proximity to inputs from the cerebral cortex on the same striatal neurons. We measured the effect of substantia nigra stimulation on these inputs from the cortex to striatal neurons and also on how quickly the rats learned to press the lever. We found that stimulation of the substantia nigra (with the optimal parameters for lever-pressing behaviour) induced potentiation of synapses between the cortex and the striatum, which required activation of dopamine receptors. The degree of potentiation within ten minutes of the ICSS trains was correlated with the time taken by the rats to learn ICSS behaviour. We propose that stimulation of the substantia nigra when the lever is pressed induces a similar potentiation of cortical inputs to the striatum, positively reinforcing the learning of the behaviour by the rats.
Most mammalian somatic cells are thought to have a limited proliferative capacity because they permanently stop dividing after a finite number of divisions in culture, a state termed replicative cell senescence. Here we show that most oligodendrocyte precursor cells purified from postnatal rat optic nerve can proliferate indefinitely in serum-free culture if prevented from differentiating; various cell cycle-inhibitory proteins increase, but the cells do not stop dividing. The cells maintain high telomerase activity and p53- and Rb-dependent cell cycle checkpoint responses, and serum or genotoxic drugs induce them to acquire a senescence-like phenotype. Our findings suggest that some normal rodent precursor cells have an unlimited proliferative capacity if cultured in conditions that avoid both differentiation and the activation of checkpoint responses that arrest the cell cycle.
Although many properties of the nervous system are shared among animals and systems, it is not known whether different neuronal circuits use common strategies to guide behaviour. Here we characterize information processing by Caenorhabditis elegans olfactory neurons (AWC) and interneurons (AIB and AIY) that control food- and odour-evoked behaviours. Using calcium imaging and mutations that affect specific neuronal connections, we show that AWC neurons are activated by odour removal and activate the AIB interneurons through AMPA-type glutamate receptors. The level of calcium in AIB interneurons is elevated for several minutes after odour removal, a neuronal correlate to the prolonged behavioural response to odour withdrawal. The AWC neuron inhibits AIY interneurons through glutamate-gated chloride channels; odour presentation relieves this inhibition and results in activation of AIY interneurons. The opposite regulation of AIY and AIB interneurons generates a coordinated behavioural response. Information processing by this circuit resembles information flow from vertebrate photoreceptors to 'OFF' bipolar and 'ON' bipolar neurons, indicating a conserved or convergent strategy for sensory information processing.
Discussions of the evolution of intelligence have focused on monkeys and apes because of their close evolutionary relationship to humans. Other large-brained social animals, such as corvids, also understand their physical and social worlds. Here we review recent studies of tool manufacture, mental time travel, and social cognition in corvids, and suggest that complex cognition depends on a "tool kit" consisting of causal reasoning, flexibility, imagination, and prospection. Because corvids and apes share these cognitive tools, we argue that complex cognitive abilities evolved multiple times in distantly related species with vastly different brain structures in order to solve similar socioecological problems.
Three dominant mutations of mec-4, a gene needed for mechanosensation, cause the touch-receptor neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans to degenerate. With deg-1, another C. elegans gene that can mutate to induce neuronal degeneration and that is similar in sequence, mec-4 defines a new gene family. Cross-hybridizing sequences are detectable in other species, raising the possibility that degenerative conditions in other organisms may be caused by mutations in similar genes. All three dominant mec-4 mutations affect the same amino acid. Effects of amino-acid substitutions at this position suggest that steric hindrance may induce the degenerative state.
The neurons responsible for the onset of sleep are thought to be located in the preoptic area and more specifically, in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). Here we identify sleep-promoting neurons in vitro and show that they represent an homogeneous population of cells that must be inhibited by systems of arousal during the waking state. We find that two-thirds of the VLPO neurons are multipolar triangular cells that show a low-threshold spike. This proportion matches that of cells active during sleep in the same region. We then show, using single-cell reverse transcriptase followed by polymerase chain reaction, that these neurons probably contain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We also show that these neurons are inhibited by noradrenaline and acetylcholine, both of which are transmitters of wakefulness. As most of these cells are also inhibited by serotonin but unaffected by histamine, their overall inhibition by transmitters of wakefulness is in agreement with their relative inactivity during waking with respect to sleep. We propose that the reciprocal inhibitory interaction of such VLPO neurons with the noradrenergic, serotoninergic and cholinergic waking systems to which they project is a key factor for promoting sleep.
Individual neurons can be recognized and identified anatomically, physiologically, and biochemically in the insect central nervous system. Biochemical analyses of extracts prepared from one such identified neuron show it to be associated with a bioactive pentapeptide called proctolin. This peptide may be a neurotransmitter, and a preparation is established in which its physiological action can be studied at the cellular level.
Deficiency in monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), an enzyme that degrades serotonin and norepinephrine, has recently been shown to be associated with aggressive behavior in men of a Dutch family. A line of transgenic mice was isolated in which transgene integration caused a deletion in the gene encoding MAOA, providing an animal model of MAOA deficiency. In pup brains, serotonin concentrations were increased up to ninefold, and serotonin-like immunoreactivity was present in catecholaminergic neurons. In pup and adult brains, norepinephrine concentrations were increased up to twofold, and cytoarchitectural changes were observed in the somatosensory cortex. Pup behavioral alterations, including trembling, difficulty in righting, and fearfulness were reversed by the serotonin synthesis inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine. Adults manifested a distinct behavioral syndrome, including enhanced aggression in males.
There are at least three RNA silencing pathways for silencing specific genes in plants. In these pathways, silencing signals can be amplified and transmitted between cells, and may even be self-regulated by feedback mechanisms. Diverse biological roles of these pathways have been established, including defence against viruses, regulation of gene expression and the condensation of chromatin into heterochromatin. We are now in a good position to investigate the full extent of this functional diversity in genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of genome control.
The peptide arginine-vasopressin (mammals) and its evolutionary precursor arginine-vasotocin (non-mammals) modulate reproductive physiology and numerous related social behaviours, as do oxytocin (mammals) and its homologues mesotocin and isotocin (fish). The distributions in the brain and/or the behavioural functions of these peptides often differ between the sexes, and between species with divergent social structures. Here we present neurophysiological evidence that males with vocal characteristics typical of females share a pattern of neuropeptide function with females rather than conspecific males. The plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) has two male morphs with different reproductive tactics and vocalizations (a key species-typical behaviour which varies in its physical attributes and contextual usage, depending on the morph's social strategy). Forebrain-evoked, rhythmic vocal-motor activity that precisely mimics natural vocalizations was modulated by arginine-vasotocin, isotocin and their antagonists delivered to the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus, a primary site for behavioural integration in all vertebrates. Peptides had different effects in males that acoustically court females (arginine-vasotocin-sensitive) than in females and sneak-spawning males (isotocin-sensitive), showing that the neuromodulatory mechanisms that establish reproduction-related behaviour can be dissociated from gonadal sex.
The plant hormone auxin regulates diverse aspects of plant growth and development. Recent studies indicate that auxin acts by promoting the degradation of the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors through the action of the ubiquitin protein ligase SCF(TIR1). The nature of the signalling cascade that leads to this effect is not known. However, recent studies indicate that the auxin receptor and other signalling components involved in this response are soluble factors. Using an in vitro pull-down assay, we demonstrate that the interaction between transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) and Aux/IAA proteins does not require stable modification of either protein. Instead auxin promotes the Aux/IAA-SCF(TIR1) interaction by binding directly to SCF(TIR1). We further show that the loss of TIR1 and three related F-box proteins eliminates saturable auxin binding in plant extracts. Finally, TIR1 synthesized in insect cells binds Aux/IAA proteins in an auxin-dependent manner. Together, these results indicate that TIR1 is an auxin receptor that mediates Aux/IAA degradation and auxin-regulated transcription.
The retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor gene (RB) has been implicated in negative growth regulation, induction of differentiation, and inhibition of cellular transformation. Homozygous inactivation of the Rb gene in the mouse leads to mid-gestational lethality with defects in erythropoiesis and neurogenesis. Here we describe the effects of the Rb-deficient state on the development of the ocular lens. The regional compartmentalization of growth, differentiation and apoptosis in the developing lens provides an ideal system to examine more closely the relationships of these processes in vivo. We demonstrate that loss of Rb function is associated with unchecked proliferation, impaired expression of differentiation markers, and inappropriate apoptosis in lens fibre cells. In addition, we show that ectopic apoptosis in Rb-deficient lenses is dependent on p53, because embryos doubly null for Rb and p53 show a nearly complete suppression of this effect. This developmental system provides a framework for understanding the consequences of the frequent mutation of both RB and p53 in human cancer.
The ability of organisms to alter their gene expression patterns in response to environmental changes is essential for viability. A central regulator of the response to oxidative stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the Yap1 transcription factor. Upon activation by increased levels of reactive oxygen species, Yap1 rapidly redistributes to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of up to 70 genes. Here we identify a redox-regulated domain of Yap1 and determine its high-resolution solution structure. In the active oxidized form, a nuclear export signal (NES) in the carboxy-terminal cysteine-rich domain is masked by disulphide-bond-mediated interactions with a conserved amino-terminal alpha-helix. Point mutations that weaken the hydrophobic interactions between the N-terminal alpha-helix and the C-terminal NES-containing domain abolished redox-regulated changes in subcellular localization of Yap1. Upon reduction of the disulphide bonds, Yap1 undergoes a change to an unstructured conformation that exposes the NES and allows redistribution to the cytoplasm. These results reveal the structural basis of redox-dependent Yap1 localization and provide a previously unknown mechanism of transcription factor regulation by reversible intramolecular disulphide bond formation.
Common copy number variations (CNVs) represent a significant source of genetic diversity, yet their influence on phenotypic variability, including disease susceptibility, remains poorly understood. To address this problem in human cancer, we performed a genome-wide association study of CNVs in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma, a disease in which single nucleotide polymorphism variations are known to influence susceptibility. We first genotyped 846 Caucasian neuroblastoma patients and 803 healthy Caucasian controls at approximately 550,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and performed a CNV-based test for association. We then replicated significant observations in two independent sample sets comprised of a total of 595 cases and 3,357 controls. Here we describe the identification of a common CNV at chromosome 1q21.1 associated with neuroblastoma in the discovery set, which was confirmed in both replication sets. This CNV was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, fluorescent in situ hybridization and analysis of matched tumour specimens, and was shown to be heritable in an independent set of 713 cancer-free parent-offspring trios. We identified a previously unknown transcript within the CNV that showed high sequence similarity to several neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) genes and represents a new member of this gene family (NBPF23). This transcript was preferentially expressed in fetal brain and fetal sympathetic nervous tissues, and the expression level was strictly correlated with CNV state in neuroblastoma cells. These data demonstrate that inherited copy number variation at 1q21.1 is associated with neuroblastoma and implicate a previously unknown neuroblastoma breakpoint family gene in early tumorigenesis of this childhood cancer.
The neural processes underlying empathy are a subject of intense interest within the social neurosciences. However, very little is known about how brain empathic responses are modulated by the affective link between individuals. We show here that empathic responses are modulated by learned preferences, a result consistent with economic models of social preferences. We engaged male and female volunteers in an economic game, in which two confederates played fairly or unfairly, and then measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while these same volunteers observed the confederates receiving pain. Both sexes exhibited empathy-related activation in pain-related brain areas (fronto-insular and anterior cingulate cortices) towards fair players. However, these empathy-related responses were significantly reduced in males when observing an unfair person receiving pain. This effect was accompanied by increased activation in reward-related areas, correlated with an expressed desire for revenge. We conclude that in men (at least) empathic responses are shaped by valuation of other people's social behaviour, such that they empathize with fair opponents while favouring the physical punishment of unfair opponents, a finding that echoes recent evidence for altruistic punishment.
Brain function emerges from the morphologies, spatial organization and patterns of connectivity established between diverse sets of neurons. Historically, the notion that neuronal structure predicts function stemmed from classic histological staining and neuronal tracing methods. Recent advances in molecular genetics and imaging technologies have begun to reveal previously unattainable details about patterns of functional circuit connectivity and the subcellular organization of synapses in the living brain. This sophisticated molecular and genetic 'toolbox', coupled with new methods in optical and electron microscopy, provides an expanding array of techniques for probing neural anatomy and function.
Extracellular gradients of signalling molecules can specify different thresholds of gene activity in development. A gradient of Decapentaplegic (Dpp) activity subdivides the dorsal ectoderm of the Drosophila embryo into amnioserosa and dorsal epidermis. The proteins Short gastrulation (Sog) and Tolloid (Tld) are required to shape this gradient. Sog has been proposed to form an inhibitory complex with either Dpp or the related ligand Screw, and is subsequently processed by the protease Tld. Paradoxically, Sog appears to be required for amnioserosa formation, which is specified by peak Dpp signalling activity. Here we show that the misexpression of sog using the even-skipped stripe-2 enhancer redistributes Dpp signalling in a mutant background in which dpp is expressed throughout the embryo. Dpp activity is diminished near the Sog stripe and peak Dpp signalling is detected far from this stripe. However, a tethered form of Sog suppresses local Dpp activity without augmenting Dpp activity at a distance, indicating that diffusion of Sog may be required for enhanced Dpp activity and consequent amnioserosa formation. The long-distance stimulation of Dpp activity by Sog requires Tld, whereas Sog-mediated inhibition of Dpp does not. The heterologous Dpp inhibitor Noggin inhibits Dpp signalling but fails to augment Dpp activity. These results suggest an unusual strategy for generating a gradient threshold of growth-factor activity, whereby Sog and its protease specify peak Dpp signalling far from a localized source of Sog.
A subset of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to preferentially reduce the secretion of the highly amyloidogenic, 42-residue amyloid-beta peptide Abeta42. We found that Rho and its effector, Rho-associated kinase, preferentially regulated the amount of Abeta42 produced in vitro and that only those NSAIDs effective as Rho inhibitors lowered Abeta42. Administration of Y-27632, a selective Rock inhibitor, also preferentially lowered brain levels of Abeta42 in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, the Rho-Rock pathway may regulate amyloid precursor protein processing, and a subset of NSAIDs can reduce Abeta42 through inhibition of Rho activity.
All animals and plants dynamically attach and remove O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) at serine and threonine residues on myriad nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. O-GlcNAc cycling, which is tightly regulated by the concerted actions of two highly conserved enzymes, serves as a nutrient and stress sensor. On some proteins, O-GlcNAc competes directly with phosphate for serine/threonine residues. Glycosylation with O-GlcNAc modulates signalling, and influences protein expression, degradation and trafficking. Emerging data indicate that O-GlcNAc glycosylation has a role in the aetiology of diabetes and neurodegeneration.
Interferons are a family of proteins first identified by their ability to induce cellular resistance to infection by many viruses. In addition to the antiviral properties it shares with the alpha- and beta-interferons, gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), a lymphokine secreted by activated T cells, activates macrophages, stimulates B cells, increases fibroblast and endothelial cell resistance to many nonviral intracellular parasites and modulates cell-surface proteins central to immune cell regulation. To identify molecules involved in the IFN-gamma response and characterize their modulation, we have isolated genes that are induced following recombinant IFN-gamma treatment of U937 cells, a histiocytic lymphoma cell line with monocytic characteristics. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a gene regulated by rIFN-gamma in U937 cells as well as in human mononuclear cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Messenger RNA from this gene is induced within 30 min of rIFN-gamma treatment and demonstrates maximal (greater than 30-fold) accumulation within 5 h. Increased transcription is partly responsible for this accumulation. This gene encodes a protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 12,378 which has significant amino-acid homology to platelet factor-4 and beta-thromboglobulin, two chemotatic proteins released by platelets on degranulation. This IFN-gamma-inducible protein may be a member of a family of proteins involved in the inflammatory process.
The DJ-1 gene encodes a ubiquitous, highly conserved protein. Here, we show that DJ-1 mutations are associated with PARK7, a monogenic form of human parkinsonism. The function of the DJ-1 protein remains unknown, but evidence suggests its involvement in the oxidative stress response. Our findings indicate that loss of DJ-1 function leads to neurodegeneration. Elucidating the physiological role of DJ-1 protein may promote understanding of the mechanisms of brain neuronal maintenance and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
Many cell-surface receptors for hormones appear to exert their effects on target cells by interacting with specific guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) which couple receptors to their second-messenger signal generation systems. A common intracellular second messenger, which is used by many hormones, is cyclic AMP. This is produced by adenylate cyclase, whose activity is controlled by two G-proteins, Gs which mediates stimulatory effects and Gi inhibitory effects on adenylate cyclase activity. In liver, the hormone glucagon increases intracellular cAMP concentrations by activating adenylate cyclase by a Gs-mediated process. This effect of glucagon is antagonised by the hormone insulin, although the molecular mechanism by which insulin elicits its actions is obscure. However, insulin receptors exhibit a tyrosyl kinase activity and appear to interact with G-proteins, perhaps by causing phosphorylation of them. In type I diabetes, circulating insulin levels are abnormally low, giving rise to gross perturbations of metabolism as well as to a variety of complications such as ionic disturbances, neuropathies of the nervous system, respiratory and cardiovascular aberrations and predisposition to infection. We show here that experimentally-induced type I diabetes leads to the loss of expression of Gi in rat liver. As it has been suggested that Gi may couple receptors to K+-channels as well as mediating the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, aberrations in the control of expression of this key regulatory protein in type I diabetes may be expected to lead to pleiotropic effects.
Synaptotagmin is a synaptic vesicle protein that is postulated to be the Ca(2+) sensor for fast, evoked neurotransmitter release. Deleting the gene for synaptotagmin (syt(null)) strongly suppresses synaptic transmission in every species examined, showing that synaptotagmin is central in the synaptic vesicle cycle. The cytoplasmic region of synaptotagmin contains two C(2) domains, C(2)A and C(2)B. Five, highly conserved, acidic residues in both the C(2)A and C(2)B domains of synaptotagmin coordinate the binding of Ca(2+) ions, and biochemical studies have characterized several in vitro Ca(2+)-dependent interactions between synaptotagmin and other nerve terminal molecules. But there has been no direct evidence that any of the Ca(2+)-binding sites within synaptotagmin are required in vivo. Here we show that mutating two of the Ca(2+)-binding aspartate residues in the C(2)B domain (D(416,418)N in Drosophila) decreased evoked transmitter release by >95%, and decreased the apparent Ca(2+) affinity of evoked transmitter release. These studies show that the Ca(2+)-binding motif of the C(2)B domain of synaptotagmin is essential for synaptic transmission.
Adrenergic modulation of calcium channels profoundly influences cardiac function, and has served as a prime example of neurohormonal regulation of voltage-gated ion channels. Channel modulation and increased Ca influx are mediated by elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP and protein phosphorylation. The molecular mechanism of the augmented membrane Ca conductance has attracted considerable interest. An increase in the density of functional channels has often been proposed, but there has previously been no direct evidence. Single-channel recordings show that isoprenaline or 8-bromocyclic AMP increase the proportion of time individual channels spend open by prolonging openings and shortening the closed periods between openings. To look for an additional contribution of changes in the number of functional channels, we applied ensemble fluctuation analysis to whole-cell recordings of cardiac Ca channel activity. Here we present evidence that in frog ventricular heart cells beta-adrenergic stimulation increases NF, the average number of functional Ca channels per cell. We also find that isoprenaline slows the time course of both activation and inactivation, and that the enhancement of peak current decreases gradually with greater membrane depolarization.
Zinc is present in presynaptic nerve terminals throughout the mammalian central nervous system and likely serves as an endogenous signaling substance. However, excessive exposure to extracellular zinc can damage central neurons. After transient forebrain ischemia in rats, chelatable zinc accumulated specifically in degenerating neurons in the hippocampal hilus and CA1, as well as in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum, and amygdala. This accumulation preceded neurodegeneration, which could be prevented by the intraventricular injection of a zinc chelating agent. The toxic influx of zinc may be a key mechanism underlying selective neuronal death after transient global ischemic insults.
The blood-brain barrier restricts the passage of molecules from the blood to the brain. The permeability of the barrier to iodine-125-labeled bovine serum albumin was examined in rats that had undergone adrenalectomy, adrenal demedullation, and corticosterone replacement. Adrenalectomy, but not adrenal demedullation, increased the permeability of brain tissue to the isotopically labeled macromolecule; corticosterone replacement reversed this effect. These results indicate that the blood-brain barrier may be hormonally regulated; that is, the pituitary-adrenal axis may physiologically modulate the permeability of the brain microvasculature to macromolecules.
Numerous human diseases are associated with the chronic expression of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins. The expansion of polyglutamine residues in unrelated proteins is associated with the early onset of neurodegenerative disease. To understand how the presence of misfolded proteins leads to cellular dysfunction, we employed Caenorhabditis elegans polyglutamine aggregation models. Here, we find that polyglutamine expansions disrupted the global balance of protein folding quality control, resulting in the loss of function of diverse metastable proteins with destabilizing temperature-sensitive mutations. In turn, these proteins, although innocuous under normal physiological conditions, enhanced the aggregation of polyglutamine proteins. Thus, weak folding mutations throughout the genome can function as modifiers of polyglutamine phenotypes and toxicity.
The ability to abstract principles or rules from direct experience allows behaviour to extend beyond specific circumstances to general situations. For example, we learn the 'rules' for restaurant dining from specific experiences and can then apply them in new restaurants. The use of such rules is thought to depend on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) because its damage often results in difficulty in following rules. Here we explore its neural basis by recording from single neurons in the PFC of monkeys trained to use two abstract rules. They were required to indicate whether two successively presented pictures were the same or different depending on which rule was currently in effect. The monkeys performed this task with new pictures, thus showing that they had learned two general principles that could be applied to stimuli that they had not yet experienced. The most prevalent neuronal activity observed in the PFC reflected the coding of these abstract rules.
To act as computational devices, neurons must perform mathematical operations as they transform synaptic and modulatory input into output firing rate. Experiments and theory indicate that neuronal firing typically represents the sum of synaptic inputs, an additive operation, but multiplication of inputs is essential for many computations. Multiplication by a constant produces a change in the slope, or gain, of the input-output relationship, amplifying or scaling down the sensitivity of the neuron to changes in its input. Such gain modulation occurs in vivo, during contrast invariance of orientation tuning, attentional scaling, translation-invariant object recognition, auditory processing and coordinate transformations. Moreover, theoretical studies highlight the necessity of gain modulation in several of these tasks. Although potential cellular mechanisms for gain modulation have been identified, they often rely on membrane noise and require restrictive conditions to work. Because nonlinear components are used to scale signals in electronics, we examined whether synaptic nonlinearities are involved in neuronal gain modulation. We used synaptic stimulation and the dynamic-clamp technique to investigate gain modulation in granule cells in acute slices of rat cerebellum. Here we show that when excitation is mediated by synapses with short-term depression (STD), neuronal gain is controlled by an inhibitory conductance in a noise-independent manner, allowing driving and modulatory inputs to be multiplied together. The nonlinearity introduced by STD transforms inhibition-mediated additive shifts in the input-output relationship into multiplicative gain changes. When granule cells were driven with bursts of high-frequency mossy fibre input, as observed in vivo, larger inhibition-mediated gain changes were observed, as expected with greater STD. Simulations of synaptic integration in more complex neocortical neurons suggest that STD-based gain modulation can also operate in neurons with large dendritic trees. Our results establish that neurons receiving depressing excitatory inputs can act as powerful multiplicative devices even when integration of postsynaptic conductances is linear.
Attention helps us process potentially important objects by selectively increasing the activity of sensory neurons that represent the relevant locations and features of our environment. This selection process requires top-down feedback about what is important in our environment. We investigated how parietal cortical output influences neural activity in early sensory areas. Neural recordings were made simultaneously from the posterior parietal cortex and an earlier area in the visual pathway, the medial temporal area, of macaques performing a visual matching task. When the monkey selectively attended to a location, the timing of activities in the two regions became synchronized, with the parietal cortex leading the medial temporal area. Parietal neurons may thus selectively increase activity in earlier sensory areas to enable focused spatial attention.
To determine the direction of a sound source in space, animals must process a variety of auditory spatial cues, including interaural level and time differences, as well as changes in the sound spectrum caused by the direction-dependent filtering of sound by the outer ear. Behavioural deficits observed when primary auditory cortex (A1) is damaged have led to the widespread view that A1 may have an essential role in this complex computational task. Here we show, however, that the spatial selectivity exhibited by the large majority of A1 neurons is well predicted by a simple linear model, which assumes that neurons additively integrate sound levels in each frequency band and ear. The success of this linear model is surprising, given that computing sound source direction is a necessarily nonlinear operation. However, because linear operations preserve information, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that A1 may also form a gateway to higher, more specialized cortical areas.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation in selected neurons of protein inclusions containing alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin. Rare inherited forms of PD are caused by autosomal dominant mutations in alpha-synuclein or by autosomal recessive mutations in parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We hypothesized that these two gene products interact functionally, namely, that parkin ubiquitinates alpha-synuclein normally and that this process is altered in autosomal recessive PD. We have now identified a protein complex in normal human brain that includes parkin as the E3 ubiquitin ligase, UbcH7 as its associated E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and a new 22-kilodalton glycosylated form of alpha-synuclein (alphaSp22) as its substrate. In contrast to normal parkin, mutant parkin associated with autosomal recessive PD failed to bind alphaSp22. In an in vitro ubiquitination assay, alphaSp22 was modified by normal but not mutant parkin into polyubiquitinated, high molecular weight species. Accordingly, alphaSp22 accumulated in a non-ubiquitinated form in parkin-deficient PD brains. We conclude that alphaSp22 is a substrate for parkin's ubiquitin ligase activity in normal human brain and that loss of parkin function causes pathological alphaSp22 accumulation. These findings demonstrate a critical biochemical reaction between the two PD-linked gene products and suggest that this reaction underlies the accumulation of ubiquitinated alpha-synuclein in conventional PD.
Every successful pregnancy requires proper embryo implantation. Low implantation rate is a major problem during infertility treatments using assisted reproductive technologies. Here we report a newly discovered molecular influence on implantation through the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor LPA3 (refs 2-4). Targeted deletion of LPA3 in mice resulted in significantly reduced litter size, which could be attributed to delayed implantation and altered embryo spacing. These two events led to delayed embryonic development, hypertrophic placentas shared by multiple embryos and embryonic death. An enzyme demonstrated to influence implantation, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) (ref. 5), was downregulated in LPA3-deficient uteri during pre-implantation. Downregulation of COX2 led to reduced levels of prostaglandins E2 and I2 (PGE2 and PGI2), which are critical for implantation. Exogenous administration of PGE2 or carbaprostacyclin (a stable analogue of PGI2) into LPA3-deficient female mice rescued delayed implantation but did not rescue defects in embryo spacing. These data identify LPA3 receptor-mediated signalling as having an influence on implantation, and further indicate linkage between LPA signalling and prostaglandin biosynthesis.
The MADS-domain transcription factor APETALA1 (AP1) is a key regulator of Arabidopsis flower development. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying AP1 function, we identified its target genes during floral initiation using a combination of gene expression profiling and genome-wide binding studies. Many of its targets encode transcriptional regulators, including known floral repressors. The latter genes are down-regulated by AP1, suggesting that it initiates floral development by abrogating the inhibitory effects of these genes. Although AP1 acts predominantly as a transcriptional repressor during the earliest stages of flower development, at more advanced stages it also activates regulatory genes required for floral organ formation, indicating a dynamic mode of action. Our results further imply that AP1 orchestrates floral initiation by integrating growth, patterning, and hormonal pathways.
In inhibiting neurite outgrowth, several myelin components, including the extracellular domain of Nogo-A (Nogo-66), oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), exert their effects through the same Nogo receptor (NgR). The glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored nature of NgR indicates the requirement for additional transmembrane protein(s) to transduce the inhibitory signals into the interior of responding neurons. Here, we demonstrate that p75, a transmembrane protein known to be a receptor for the neurotrophin family of growth factors, specifically interacts with NgR. p75 is required for NgR-mediated signalling, as neurons from p75 knockout mice are no longer responsive to myelin and to each of the known NgR ligands. Blocking the p75-NgR interaction also reduces the activities of these inhibitors. Moreover, a truncated p75 protein lacking the intracellular domain, when overexpressed in primary neurons, attenuates the same set of inhibitory activities, suggesting that p75 is a signal transducer of the NgR-p75 receptor complex. Thus, interfering with p75 and its downstream signalling pathways may allow lesioned axons to overcome most of the inhibitory activities associated with central nervous system myelin.
The mechanisms controlling axon guidance are of fundamental importance in understanding brain development. Growing corticospinal and somatosensory axons cross the midline in the medulla to reach their targets and thus form the basis of contralateral motor control and sensory input. The motor and sensory projections appeared uncrossed in patients with horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS). In patients affected with HGPPS, we identified mutations in the ROBO3 gene, which shares homology with roundabout genes important in axon guidance in developing Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse. Like its murine homolog Rig1/Robo3, but unlike other Robo proteins, ROBO3 is required for hindbrain axon midline crossing.
D. G. Rainnie et al., in their report "Adenosine inhibition of mesopontine cholinergic neurons: Implications for EEG arousal" (4 Feb., p. 689), suggested that adenosine may mediate sleep-debt related potentiation of EEG slow-wave activity in non-REM sleep. This is similar to a hypothesis proposed by J. H. Benington et al. [Sleep Res. 22, 4 (1993)]. Rainnie et al. suggested that adenosine exerts this effect by means of inhibition of mesopontine cholinergic neurons rather than by direct inhibition of neurons in the cerebral cortex.
Functional impairment of antigen-specific T cells is a defining characteristic of many chronic infections, but the underlying mechanisms of T-cell dysfunction are not well understood. To address this question, we analysed genes expressed in functionally impaired virus-specific CD8 T cells present in mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and compared these with the gene profile of functional memory CD8 T cells. Here we report that PD-1 (programmed death 1; also known as Pdcd1) was selectively upregulated by the exhausted T cells, and that in vivo administration of antibodies that blocked the interaction of this inhibitory receptor with its ligand, PD-L1 (also known as B7-H1), enhanced T-cell responses. Notably, we found that even in persistently infected mice that were lacking CD4 T-cell help, blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway had a beneficial effect on the 'helpless' CD8 T cells, restoring their ability to undergo proliferation, secrete cytokines, kill infected cells and decrease viral load. Blockade of the CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) inhibitory pathway had no effect on either T-cell function or viral control. These studies identify a specific mechanism of T-cell exhaustion and define a potentially effective immunological strategy for the treatment of chronic viral infections.
The neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM, appears on early embryonic cells and is important in the formation of cell collectives and their boundaries at sites of morphogenesis. Later in development it is found on various differentiated tissues and is a major CAM mediating adhesion among neurons and between neurons and muscle. To provide a molecular basis for understanding N-CAM function, the complete amino acid sequences of the three major polypeptides of N-CAM and most of the noncoding sequences of their messenger RNA's were determined from the analysis of complementary DNA clones and were verified by amino acid sequences of selected CNBr fragments and proteolytic fragments. The extracellular region of each N-CAM polypeptide includes five contiguous segments that are homologous in sequence to each other and to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, suggesting that interactions among immunoglobulin-like domains form the basis for N-CAM homophilic binding. Although different in their membrane-associated and cytoplasmic domains, the amino acid sequences of the three polypeptides appear to be identical throughout this extracellular region (682 amino acids) where the binding site is located. Variations in N-CAM activity thus do not occur by changes in the amino acid sequence that alter the specificity of binding. Instead, regulation is achieved by cell surface modulation events that alter N-CAM affinity, prevalence, mobility, and distribution on the surface. A major mechanism for modulation is alternative RNA splicing resulting in N-CAM's with different cytoplasmic domains that differentially interact with the cell membrane. Such regulatory mechanisms may link N-CAM binding function with other primary cellular processes during the embryonic development of pattern.
A hallmark of mammalian brain evolution is the disproportionate increase in neocortical size as compared with subcortical structures. Because primary visual cortex (V1) is the most thoroughly understood cortical region, the visual system provides an excellent model in which to investigate the evolutionary expansion of neocortex. I have compared the numbers of neurons in the visual thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus; LGN) and area V1 across primate species. Here I find that the number of V1 neurons increases as the 3/2 power of the number of LGN neurons. As a consequence of this scaling law, the human, for example, uses four times as many V1 neurons per LGN neuron (356) to process visual information as does a tarsier (87). I argue that the 3/2 power relationship is a natural consequence of the organization of V1, together with the requirement that spatial resolution in V1 should parallel the maximum resolution provided by the LGN. The additional observation that thalamus/neocortex follows the same evolutionary scaling law as LGN/V1 may suggest that neocortex generally conforms to the same organizational principle as V1.
The cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (Cdk4/6) that control the G1 phase of the cell cycle and their inhibitor, the p16INK4a tumour suppressor, have a central role in cell proliferation and in tumorigenesis. The structures of Cdk6 bound to p16INK4a and to the related p19INK4d reveal that the INK4 inhibitors bind next to the ATP-binding site of the catalytic cleft, opposite where the activating cyclin subunit binds. They prevent cyclin binding indirectly by causing structural changes that propagate to the cyclin-binding site. The INK4 inhibitors also distort the kinase catalytic cleft and interfere with ATP binding, which explains how they can inhibit the preassembled Cdk4/6-cyclin D complexes as well. Tumour-derived mutations in INK4a and Cdk4 map to interface contacts, solidifying the role of CDK binding and inhibition in the tumour suppressor activity of p16INK4a.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade is a prominent cellular pathway used by many growth factors, hormones and neurotransmitters to regulate physiological responses. Although activation of the MAPK pathway by receptors with tyrosine kinase activity is well defined, the mechanism used by heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors to activate this pathway is less clear. Here we show that in cells deficient in the Src-related tyrosine kinase Lyn, stimulation of MAPK kinase and MARPK by Gq-coupled m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) is blocked, whereas Gi-coupled m2 mAChR-mediated stimulation is unaffected. In cells deficient in the tyrosine kinase Syk, both m1 and m2 mAChRs failed to stimulate MAPK kinase and MAPK. This result indicates that Syk is essential for the Gi-coupled pathway and that Lyn and Syk are necessary for the Gq-coupled pathway.
To ascertain whether Huntington's chorea and schizophrenia are associated with specific regional alterations in neurotensin, somatostatin, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, the concentrations of these putative neurotransmitters were measured by radioimmunoassay in postmortem brain samples from patients with Huntington's chorea or schizophrenia. Compared to 50 patients without psychiatric or neurological disease, the patients with Huntington's chorea showed significantly elevated concentrations of all three neuropeptides in the nucleus caudatus. In the nucleus accumbens somatostatin levels were increased threefold, while in the amygdala thyrotropin-releasing hormone levels were elevated. In contrast, the schizophrenics exhibited reduced levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone in two frontal cortical regions, reduced somatostatin levels in one frontal cortical area, and increased neurotensin levels in one frontal cortical area. None of the differences between the diseased brains and the controls could be accounted for by differences in age, sex, or time between death and autopsy.
The Peutz-Jegher syndrome tumor-suppressor gene encodes a protein-threonine kinase, LKB1, which phosphorylates and activates AMPK [adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase]. The deletion of LKB1 in the liver of adult mice resulted in a nearly complete loss of AMPK activity. Loss of LKB1 function resulted in hyperglycemia with increased gluconeogenic and lipogenic gene expression. In LKB1-deficient livers, TORC2, a transcriptional coactivator of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), was dephosphorylated and entered the nucleus, driving the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), which in turn drives gluconeogenesis. Adenoviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) for TORC2 reduced PGC-1alpha expression and normalized blood glucose levels in mice with deleted liver LKB1, indicating that TORC2 is a critical target of LKB1/AMPK signals in the regulation of gluconeogenesis. Finally, we show that metformin, one of the most widely prescribed type 2 diabetes therapeutics, requires LKB1 in the liver to lower blood glucose levels.
A single injection of 10 microliters of antiserum to total brain ganglioside onto (and into) the sensorimotor cortex of the rat resulted in recurrent spiking in the cortical electroencephalogram, lasting from 7 to 17 days. Absorption of antibody with pure monosialoganglioside (GM1) completely abosished the effect. Spiking was reactivated after 4 weeks by intramuscular injection of pentylenetetrazole.
Among the identifiable cells in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia californica are five that generate bursting rhythms endogenous to the cells. In the four bursting cells of the left upper quadrant the rhythm is modulated by a unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potential; in the bursting cell of the right lower quadrant the rhythm is modulated by a unitary excitatory postsynaptic potential. Both the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are mediated by separate branches of a single interneuron. The pharmacological properties of the double action interneuron as well as those of the follower cells suggest that a single transmitter (acetylcholine) is involved in both the excitatory and the in-hibitory action of the interneuron.
Inhibition of the TOR signalling pathway by genetic or pharmacological intervention extends lifespan in invertebrates, including yeast, nematodes and fruitflies; however, whether inhibition of mTOR signalling can extend lifespan in a mammalian species was unknown. Here we report that rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, extends median and maximal lifespan of both male and female mice when fed beginning at 600 days of age. On the basis of age at 90% mortality, rapamycin led to an increase of 14% for females and 9% for males. The effect was seen at three independent test sites in genetically heterogeneous mice, chosen to avoid genotype-specific effects on disease susceptibility. Disease patterns of rapamycin-treated mice did not differ from those of control mice. In a separate study, rapamycin fed to mice beginning at 270 days of age also increased survival in both males and females, based on an interim analysis conducted near the median survival point. Rapamycin may extend lifespan by postponing death from cancer, by retarding mechanisms of ageing, or both. To our knowledge, these are the first results to demonstrate a role for mTOR signalling in the regulation of mammalian lifespan, as well as pharmacological extension of lifespan in both genders. These findings have implications for further development of interventions targeting mTOR for the treatment and prevention of age-related diseases.
An enduring controversy in neuroscience concerns how the brain "binds" together separately coded stimulus features to form unitary representations of objects. Recent evidence has indicated a close link between this binding process and 40-hertz (gamma-band) oscillations generated by localized neural circuits. In a separate line of research, the ability of young infants to perceive objects as unitary and bounded has become a central focus for debates about the mechanisms of perceptual development. Here we demonstrate that binding-related 40-hertz oscillations are evident in the infant brain around 8 months of age, which is the same age at which behavioral and event-related potential evidence indicates the onset of perceptual binding of spatially separated static visual features.
Apoptosis is an essential process in the development and homeostasis of all metazoans. The inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) proteins suppress cell death by inhibiting the activity of caspases; this inhibition is performed by the zinc-binding BIR domains of the IAP proteins. The mitochondrial protein Smac/DIABLO promotes apoptosis by eliminating the inhibitory effect of IAPs through physical interactions. Amino-terminal sequences in Smac/DIABLO are required for this function, as mutation of the very first amino acid leads to loss of interaction with IAPs and concomitant loss of Smac/DIABLO function. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of Smac/DIABLO complexed with the third BIR domain (BIR3) of XIAP. Our results show that the N-terminal four residues (Ala-Val-Pro-Ile) in Smac/DIABLO recognize a surface groove on BIR3, with the first residue Ala binding a hydrophobic pocket and making five hydrogen bonds to neighbouring residues on BIR3. These observations provide a structural explanation for the roles of the Smac N terminus as well as the conserved N-terminal sequences in the Drosophila proteins Hid/Grim/Reaper. In conjunction with other observations, our results reveal how Smac may relieve IAP inhibition of caspase-9 activity. In addition to explaining a number of biological observations, our structural analysis identifies potential targets for drug screening.
Cyclin degradation is central to regulation of the cell cycle. Mitotic exit was proposed to require degradation of the S phase cyclin Clb5 by the anaphase-promoting complex activated by Cdc20 (APC(Cdc20)). Furthermore, Clb5 degradation was thought to be necessary for effective dephosphorylation and activation of the APC regulatory subunit Cdh1 (also known as Hct1) and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 by the phosphatase Cdc14, allowing mitotic kinase inactivation and mitotic exit. Here we show, however, that spindle disassembly and cell division occur without significant APC(Cdc20)-mediated Clb5 degradation, as well as in the absence of both Cdh1 and Sic1. We find instead that destruction-box-dependent degradation of the mitotic cyclin Clb2 is essential for mitotic exit. APC(Cdc20) may be required for an essential early phase of Clb2 degradation, and this phase may be sufficient for most aspects of mitotic exit. Cdh1 and Sic1 may be required for further inactivation of Clb2-Cdk1, regulating cell size and the length of G1.
A motor illusion was created to separate human subjects' perception of arm movement from their actual movement during figure drawing. Trajectories constructed from cortical activity recorded in monkeys performing the same task showed that the actual movement was represented in the primary motor cortex, whereas the visualized, presumably perceived, trajectories were found in the ventral premotor cortex. Perception and action representations can be differentially recognized in the brain and may be contained in separate structures.
One presentation of a word to a subject is enough to change the way in which the word is processed subsequently, even when there is no conscious (explicit) memory of the original presentation. This phenomenon is known as implicit memory. The neural correlates of implicit memory have been studied previously, but they have never been compared with the correlates of explicit memory while holding task conditions constant or while using a procedure that ensured that the neural correlates were not 'contaminated' by explicit memory. Here we use scalp-recorded event-related brain potentials to identify neural activity associated with implicit and explicit memory during the performance of a recognition memory task. Relative to new words, recently studied words produced activity in three neuroanatomically and functionally dissociable neural populations. One of these populations was activated whether or not the word was consciously recognized, and its activity therefore represents a neural correlate of implicit memory. Thus, when task and memory contamination effects are eliminated, the neural correlates of explicit and implicit memory differ qualitatively.
In several species the myometrium is quiescent shortly before parturition. At this time high titres of relaxin are present in the plasma and there is evidence that the hormone has a direct inhibitory action on the uterine muscle. Relaxin could also contribute to uterine quiescence by inhibiting oxytocin release. To determine whether relaxin has a central action on the release of oxytocin, we have studied the effect of intravenous injections of porcine relaxin on milk ejection in the anaesthetized lactating rat. We report that reflex milk ejection was suppressed by relaxin in a dose-dependent manner, the onset of inhibition being rapid and lasting from 10 to 60 min. After the period of inhibition the normal temporal pattern of reflex milk ejection was resumed. Mammary sensitivity to exogenous or endogenous oxytocin was reduced by relaxin but not sufficiently to explain the effects observed. Furthermore, relaxin (1 microgram per rat) injected into the cerebral ventricles profoundly disturbed the pattern of reflex milk ejection without affecting the response of the mammary gland to oxytocin. These results suggest a novel role for relaxin within the central nervous system. The site in the brain at which the effects of relaxin are exerted remains unknown.
The plant growth-hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) is involved in regulating such diverse processes as cell elongation, cell division and differentiation. The sequence of events leading to the various phenomena is still poorly understood. Both changes in extra- and intracellular pH (refs 1-4) and selective transcription are known to be induced by auxin. Evidence for auxin receptors at the plasmalemma membrane has been reported, but the signal transduction pathway is not known, for this nor for other plant hormones. In animal cells, hydrolysis of inositolphospholipids is a major mechanism for transmembrane signalling in response to external stimuli such as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, antigens or light (reviewed in refs 8-11). Here we report that auxin can generate transient changes in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and inositol bisphosphate (InsP2) within minutes in Catharanthus roseus cells arrested in G1. These changes are accompanied by a redistribution within the polyphosphoinositide fraction. As the physiological response to auxin addition is to relieve the arrest in G1, we suggest that these effects are an element in the signal transduction of this plant hormone.
Human electrocortical potentials evoked by self-administered auditory and visual stimuli manifest much smaller amplitude and faster poststimulus timing than do average brain responses evoked by identical machine-delivered stimuli. Auditory evoked potentials show this "self-stimulation effect" to a greater degree than do visual responses. For visual evoked potentials, the effect appears greater at the vertex association area than over the occipital cortex. Individual differences in the magnitude of the "self-stimutlation effect" relate to level of intelligence.
PSD-95 is a component of postsynaptic densities in central synapses. It contains three PDZ domains that localize N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2 (NMDA2 receptor) and K+ channels to synapses. In mouse forebrain, PSD-95 bound to the cytoplasmic COOH-termini of neuroligins, which are neuronal cell adhesion molecules that interact with beta-neurexins and form intercellular junctions. Neuroligins bind to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95, whereas NMDA2 receptors and K+ channels interact with the first and second PDZ domains. Thus different PDZ domains of PSD-95 are specialized for distinct functions. PSD-95 may recruit ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors to intercellular junctions formed between neurons by neuroligins and beta-neurexins.
The Lewy body, a histological hallmark of Parkinson's disease, is a filamentous inclusion residing most prominently in pigmented neurons of the brainstem. Immunocytochemical reactions of Lewy bodies were examined with antisera to several filamentous proteins of the nervous system and positive reactions were found with those against neurofilaments. An abnormal organization of the neuronal cytoskeleton may be a pathological feature of Parkinson's disease.
Neuronal rhythmic activities within thalamocortical circuits range from partially synchronous oscillations during normal sleep to hypersynchrony associated with absence epilepsy. It has been proposed that recurrent inhibition within the thalamic reticular nucleus serves to reduce synchrony and thus prevents seizures. Inhibition and synchrony in slices from mice devoid of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABAA) receptor beta3 subunit were examined, because in rodent thalamus, beta3 is largely restricted to reticular nucleus. In beta3 knockout mice, GABAA-mediated inhibition was nearly abolished in reticular nucleus, but was unaffected in relay cells. In addition, oscillatory synchrony was dramatically intensified. Thus, recurrent inhibitory connections within reticular nucleus act as "desynchronizers."
The auditory brainstem response varies in a circadian rhythm that is negatively correlated with the circadian rhythm in oral temperature. The auditory brainstem responses and oral temperature were recorded every 3 hours from three healthy male subjects during a 2-day period. The data indicate that a reduction of 1 degree C in oral temperature is associated with an increase of 200 microseconds in the latency of wave V of the auditory brainstem response, and of 160 microseconds in the interval between waves I and V.
The activation of protein kinase C by diacylglycerol and by tumour promoters has implicated this enzyme in transmembrane signalling and in the regulation of the cell cycle. In vitro studies revealed that catalytic activity requires the presence of calcium and phospholipids with a preference for phosphatidylserine. Diacylglycerol and tumour promoters such as phorbol esters bind to the enzyme, leading to its activation while sharply increasing its affinity for Ca2+ and phospholipid. Addition of diacylglycerol analogues or phorbol esters to intact cells results in the phosphorylation of specific polypeptides. Several cellular processes, including hormone and neurotransmitter release and receptor down-regulation, are modulated by the activation of protein kinase C, while phorbol ester-induced stimulation of the enzyme in whole cells has been associated with its translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Moreover, the use of Ca2+ ionophores has revealed an apparent synergism between Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C activation. This synergism has recently also been found to apply to receptor down-regulation (ref. 23 and accompanying paper). Here we describe a reconstitution system in which intracellular translocation of protein kinase C and the synergism between Ca2+ and enzyme activators can be studied. The results suggest a rationale for concomitant Ca2+ mobilization and diacylglycerol formation in response to some hormones, neurotransmitters and growth factors.
Quantitative fluorescence imaging was used to study the regulation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) number and density at neuromuscular junctions in living adult mice. At fully functional synapses, AChRs have a half-life of about 14 days. However, 2 hours after neurotransmission was blocked, the half-life of the AChRs was now less than a day; the rate was 25 times faster than before. Most of the lost receptors were not quickly replaced. Direct muscle stimulation or restoration of synaptic transmission inhibited this process. AChRs that were removed from nonfunctional synapses resided for hours in the perijunctional membrane before being locally internalized. Dispersed AChRs could also reaggregate at the junction once neurotransmission was restored. The rapid and reversible alterations in AChR density at the neuromuscular junction in vivo parallel changes thought to occur in the central nervous system at synapses undergoing potentiation and depression.
Recent studies have provided evidence for a role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation of the function of various potassium and calcium channels (for reviews, see refs 1, 2). As these ion channels have not yet been isolated and characterized, it has not been possible to determine whether phosphorylation of the ion channels themselves alters their properties or whether some indirect mechanism is involved. In contrast, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a neurotransmitter-dependent ion channel, has been extensively characterized biochemically and has been shown to be directly phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of this receptor is catalysed by at least three different protein kinases (cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C and a tyrosine-specific protein kinase) on seven different phosphorylation sites. However, the functional significance of phosphorylation of the receptor has been unclear. We have now examined the functional effects of phosphorylation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. We investigated the ion transport properties of the purified and reconstituted acetylcholine receptor before and after phosphorylation. We report here that phosphorylation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the gamma- and delta-subunits by cAMP-dependent protein kinase increases the rate of the rapid desensitization of the receptor, a process by which the receptor is inactivated in the presence of acetylcholine (ACh). These results provide the first direct evidence that phosphorylation of an ion channel protein modulates its function and suggest that phosphorylation of postsynaptic receptors in general may play an important role in synaptic plasticity.
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is a blood malignancy afflicting mainly children and adolescents. T-ALL patients present at diagnosis with increased white cell counts and hepatosplenomegaly, and are at an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse. For that reason, T-ALL patients usually receive cranial irradiation in addition to intensified intrathecal chemotherapy. The marked increase in survival is thought to be worth the considerable side-effects associated with this therapy. Such complications include secondary tumours, neurocognitive deficits, endocrine disorders and growth impairment. Little is known about the mechanism of leukaemic cell infiltration of the CNS, despite its clinical importance. Here we show, using T-ALL animal modelling and gene-expression profiling, that the chemokine receptor CCR7 (ref. 5) is the essential adhesion signal required for the targeting of leukaemic T-cells into the CNS. Ccr7 gene expression is controlled by the activity of the T-ALL oncogene Notch1 and is expressed in human tumours carrying Notch1-activating mutations. Silencing of either CCR7 or its chemokine ligand CCL19 (ref. 6) in an animal model of T-ALL specifically inhibits CNS infiltration. Furthermore, murine CNS-targeting by human T-ALL cells depends on their ability to express CCR7. These studies identify a single chemokine-receptor interaction as a CNS 'entry' signal, and open the way for future pharmacological targeting. Targeted inhibition of CNS involvement in T-ALL could potentially decrease the intensity of CNS-targeted therapy, thus reducing its associated short- and long-term complications.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other neurotrophins are essential for normal brain function. Many types of neurons in the central nervous system are excited by BDNF or neurotrophin-4/5, an action that has recently been implicated in synaptic plasticity. The mechanisms involved in this transmitter-like action of neurotrophins remains unclear. Here, by screening candidate genes with an antisense messenger RNA expression approach and by co-expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB and various sodium channels, we demonstrate that the tetrodotoxin-insensitive sodium channel Na(V)1.9 underlies the neurotrophin-evoked excitation. These results establish the molecular basis of neurotrophin-evoked depolarization and reveal a mechanism of ligand-mediated sodium channel activation.
The lateral hypothalamic area is considered the classic 'feeding centre', regulating food intake, arousal and motivated behaviour through the actions of orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). These neuropeptides are inhibited in response to feeding-related signals and are released during fasting. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate and integrate these signals remain poorly understood. Here we show that the forkhead box transcription factor Foxa2, a downstream target of insulin signalling, regulates the expression of orexin and MCH. During fasting, Foxa2 binds to MCH and orexin promoters and stimulates their expression. In fed and in hyperinsulinemic obese mice, insulin signalling leads to nuclear exclusion of Foxa2 and reduced expression of MCH and orexin. Constitutive activation of Foxa2 in the brain (Nes-Cre/+;Foxa2T156A(flox/flox) genotype) results in increased neuronal MCH and orexin expression and increased food consumption, metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Spontaneous physical activity of these animals in the fed state is significantly increased and is similar to that in fasted mice. Conditional activation of Foxa2 through the T156A mutation expression in the brain of obese mice also resulted in improved glucose homeostasis, decreased fat and increased lean body mass. Our results demonstrate that Foxa2 can act as a metabolic sensor in neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area to integrate metabolic signals, adaptive behaviour and physiological responses.
Many of the signaling properties of neurons and other electrically excitable cells are determined by a diverse family of potassium channels. A number of genes that encode potassium channel polypeptides have been cloned from various organisms on the basis of their sequence similarity to the Drosophila Shaker (Sh) locus. As an alternative strategy, a molecular analysis of other Drosophila genes that were defined by mutations that perturb potassium channel function was undertaken. Sequence analysis of complementary DNA from the ether a go-go (eag) locus revealed that it encodes a structural component of potassium channels that is related to but is distinct from all identified potassium channel polypeptides.
Chicken cerebellum expresses a polypeptide antigenically and biochemically related to the alpha subunit of spectrin, an erythrocyte membrane-cytoskeletal protein. Most of this polypeptide is associated with a brain specific spectrin subunit, gamma-spectrin, and is localized in virtually all neuronal cell bodies and processes. Cerebellum also expresses polypeptides antigenically related to the beta subunits of erythrocyte spectrin and these are also found in association with cerebellar alpha-spectrin but are confined to the plasmalemma of the neuronal cell bodies. This suggests that there is a mechanism for segregating different spectrin complexes into distinct membrane domains within a single cell.
Studies of the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease exemplify the increasingly blurred distinction between basic and applied biomedical research. The four genes so far implicated in familial Alzheimer's disease have each been shown to elevate brain levels of the self-aggregating amyloid-beta protein, leading gradually to profound neuronal and glial alteration, synaptic loss and dementia. Progress in understanding this cascade has helped to identify specific therapeutic targets and provides a model for elucidating other neurodegenerative disorders.
Postmortem brain specimens from 18 schizophrenic patients and 12 normal controls were assayed for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), the enzyme responsible for the final step in norepinephrine biosynthesis. There was a significant reduction in the DBH activity of the schizophrenic group in all brain regions examined. Enzyme deficits in hippocampus and diencephalon were somewhat larger than that in pons-medulla. Since various extraneous factors, such as non-specific deterioration, drug treatment, duration of hospitalization, cause of death, sex, and age could be ruled out, the deficits in DBH mnay be associated with the schizophrenic disease process. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that noradrenergic "reward" pathways are damaged in schizophrenia.
The alpha subunit of p21(RAS) farnesyltransferase (FNTA), which is also shared by geranylgeranyltransferase, was isolated as a specific cytoplasmic interactor of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and activin type I receptors with the use of the yeast two-hybrid system. FNTA interacts specifically with ligand-free TGF-beta type l receptor but is phosphorylated and released upon ligand binding. Furthermore, the release is dependent on the kinase activity of the TGF-beta type II receptor. Thus, the growth inhibitory and differentiative pathways activated by TGF-beta and activin involve novel mechanisms of serine-threonine receptor phosphorylation-dependent release of cytoplasmic interactors and regulation of the activation of small G proteins, such as p21(RAS).
Conditioned fear responses to a tone previously paired with a shock diminish if the tone is repeatedly presented without the shock, a process known as extinction. Since Pavlov it has been hypothesized that extinction does not erase conditioning, but forms a new memory. Destruction of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, which consists of infralimbic and prelimbic cortices, blocks recall of fear extinction, indicating that medial prefrontal cortex might store long-term extinction memory. Here we show that infralimbic neurons recorded during fear conditioning and extinction fire to the tone only when rats are recalling extinction on the following day. Rats that froze the least showed the greatest increase in infralimbic tone responses. We also show that conditioned tones paired with brief electrical stimulation of infralimbic cortex elicit low freezing in rats that had not been extinguished. Thus, stimulation resembling extinction-induced infralimbic tone responses is able to simulate extinction memory. We suggest that consolidation of extinction learning potentiates infralimbic activity, which inhibits fear during subsequent encounters with fear stimuli.
Two angiotensin II (Ang II)-specific receptors, AGTR1 and AGTR2, are expressed in the mammalian brain. Ang II actions on blood pressure regulation, water electrolyte balance, and hormone secretion are primarily mediated by AGTR1. The function of AGTR2 remains unclear. Here, we show that expression of the AGTR2 gene was absent in a female patient with mental retardation (MR) who had a balanced X;7 chromosomal translocation. Additionally, 8 of 590 unrelated male patients with MR were found to have sequence changes in the AGTR2 gene, including one frameshift and three missense mutations. These findings indicate a role for AGTR2 in brain development and cognitive function.
The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA1) is expressed in latently EBV-infected B lymphocytes that persist for life in healthy virus carriers, and is the only viral protein regularly detected in all malignancies associated with EBV. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted, EBNA1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses have not been demonstrated. Using recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding chimaeric proteins containing an immunodominant human leukocyte antigen A11-restricted CTL epitope, amino acids 416-424 of the EBNA4 protein, inserted within the intact EBNA1, or within an EBNA1 deletion mutant devoid of the internal Gly-Ala repetitive sequence, we demonstrate that the Gly-Ala repeats generate a cis-acting inhibitory signal that interferes with antigen processing and MHC class I-restricted presentation. Insertion of the Gly-Ala repeats downstream of the 416-424 epitope inhibited CTL recognition of a chimaeric EBNA4 protein. The results highlight a previously unknown mechanism of viral escape from CTL surveillance, and support the view that the resistance of cells expressing EBNA1 to rejection mediated by CTL is a critical requirement for EBV persistence and pathogenesis.
Activation of the complement cascade induces inflammatory responses and marks cells for immune clearance. In the central complement-amplification step, a complex consisting of surface-bound C3b and factor B is cleaved by factor D to generate active convertases on targeted surfaces. We present crystal structures of the pro-convertase C3bB at 4 angstrom resolution and its complex with factor D at 3.5 angstrom resolution. Our data show how factor B binding to C3b forms an open "activation" state of C3bB. Factor D specifically binds the open conformation of factor B through a site distant from the catalytic center and is activated by the substrate, which displaces factor D's self-inhibitory loop. This concerted proteolytic mechanism, which is cofactor-dependent and substrate-induced, restricts complement amplification to C3b-tagged target cells.
Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that affects 1% of the population. Despite intensive study, its molecular etiology remains enigmatic. Like many common diseases, schizophrenia is multifactorial in origin, with both genetic and environmental contributions likely playing an important role in the manifestation of symptoms. Recent advances based on pharmacological studies, brain imaging analyses, and genetic research are now converging on tantalizing leads that point to a central role for several neurotransmitters, including dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin, that may interface with neurodevelopmental defects reflecting disease-related genetic aberrations. Here, we provide a brief overview of the parallel approaches being used to identify the molecular causes of schizophrenia and discuss possible directions for future research.
The formamidine pesticide chlordimeform and its N-demethylated metabolites cause the light organ of the firefly Photinus pyralis L. to glow brightly. Monodemethyl chlordimeform is active at doses as low as 5 nanograms per insect when applied topically. This action is postsynaptic and probably involves membrane-bound receptors since cyproheptadine blocks the glows induced by both monodemethyl chlordimeform and octopamine, the putative neurotransmitter in the light organ. The pesticidal and pestistatic properties of the formamidines may result from actions on octopaminergic systems.
Synapsins are neuronal phosphoproteins that coat synaptic vesicles, bind to the cytoskeleton, and are believed to function in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Molecular cloning reveals that the synapsins comprise a family of four homologous proteins whose messenger RNA's are generated by differential splicing of transcripts from two genes. Each synapsin is a mosaic composed of homologous amino-terminal domains common to all synapsins and different combinations of distinct carboxyl-terminal domains. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrate that all four synapsins are widely distributed in nerve terminals, but that their relative amounts vary among different kinds of synapses. The structural diversity and differential distribution of the four synapsins suggest common and different roles of each in the integration of distinct signal transduction pathways that modulate neurotransmitter release in various types of neurons.
The Pax genes comprise a family of transcription factors active in specific tissues during embryonic development and are associated with at least three developmental mutations in mouse and man. In the developing kidney, Pax-2 is expressed in the induced mesenchyme, in the ureter epithelium, and in early epithelial structures derived from the mesenchyme. Pax-2 expression is repressed upon terminal differentiation of the renal tubule epithelium, but persists in the undifferentiated epithelium of human Wilms' tumours. We have produced a dominant gain-of-function mutation in transgenic mice by deregulating the expression of the mouse Pax-2 gene. The data obtained with four independently derived transgenic embryos and with one transgenic line demonstrate that deregulated Pax-2 expression results in histologically abnormal and dysfunctional renal epithelium with properties similar to congenital nephrotic syndrome. Thus, repression of Pax-2 is required for normal kidney development and persistent expression of Pax-2 may restrict the differentiation potential of renal epithelial cells.
Although it is known that Parkinson's disease results from a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, the resulting alterations in activity in the basal ganglia responsible for parkinsonian motor deficits are still poorly characterized. Recently, increased activity in the subthalamic nucleus has been implicated in the motor abnormalities. To test this hypothesis, the effects of lesions of the subthalamic nucleus were evaluated in monkeys rendered parkinsonian by treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The lesions reduced all of the major motor disturbances in the contralateral limbs, including akinesia, rigidity, and tremor. This result supports the postulated role of excessive activity in the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease.
Changes in neural responses based on spatial attention have been demonstrated in many areas of visual cortex, indicating that the neural correlate of attention is an enhanced response to stimuli at an attended location and reduced responses to stimuli elsewhere. Here we demonstrate non-spatial, feature-based attentional modulation of visual motion processing, and show that attention increases the gain of direction-selective neurons in visual cortical area MT without narrowing the direction-tuning curves. These findings place important constraints on the neural mechanisms of attention and we propose to unify the effects of spatial location, direction of motion and other features of the attended stimuli in a 'feature similarity gain model' of attention.
The motor abnormalities of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by alterations in basal ganglia network activity, including disinhibition of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and excessive activity of the major output nuclei. Using adeno-associated viral vector-mediated somatic cell gene transfer, we expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme that catalyzes synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA, in excitatory glutamatergic neurons of the STN in rats. The transduced neurons, when driven by electrical stimulation, produced mixed inhibitory responses associated with GABA release. This phenotypic shift resulted in strong neuroprotection of nigral dopamine neurons and rescue of the parkinsonian behavioral phenotype. This strategy suggests that there is plasticity between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain that could be exploited for therapeutic benefit.
Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), which was first detected by its binding to the kappa B site in the immunoglobulin kappa-gene enhancer, is important for the regulated expression of the kappa-gene and is partly responsible for the induction in appropriate cells of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2 alpha receptor, beta-interferon and serum amyloid A protein. NF-kappa B is present as a nuclear DNA-binding protein in B lymphocytes and mature macrophages, but is found in the cytoplasm of many cells in a form unable to bind to DNA. The cytoplasmic form is bound to an inhibitor protein, I kappa B, from which it can be released in vitro by deoxycholate and other agents. Activation of cells by various agents, notably the phorbol esters that stimulate protein kinase C (PKC), leads to dissociation in vivo of the NF-kappa B/I kappa B complex and migration of NF-kappa B to the nucleus. Therefore, it acts as a second messenger system, transducing activation signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. To elucidate the mechanism of signal transfer, we have used an in vitro system in which addition of purified protein kinases to a partially purified NF-kappa B/I kappa B complex leads to the activation of the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B. Using gel retardation assays we found that PKC, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and a haem-regulated eIF-2 kinase (HRI) could activate NF-kappa B in vitro, whereas casein kinase II was ineffective. To determine the target for the protein kinases we purified and characterized both NF-kappa B and I kappa B and found that I kappa B is phosphorylated and inactivated in the presence of PKC and HRI but not PKA.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that direct messenger RNA degradation or disrupt mRNA translation in a sequence-dependent manner. For more than a decade, attempts to study the interaction of miRNAs with their targets were confined to the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs, fuelling an underlying assumption that these regions are the principal recipients of miRNA activity. Here we focus on the mouse Nanog, Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Sox2 genes and demonstrate the existence of many naturally occurring miRNA targets in their amino acid coding sequence (CDS). Some of the mouse targets analysed do not contain the miRNA seed, whereas others span exon-exon junctions or are not conserved in the human and rhesus genomes. miR-134, miR-296 and miR-470, upregulated on retinoic-acid-induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, target the CDS of each transcription factor in various combinations, leading to transcriptional and morphological changes characteristic of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, and resulting in a new phenotype. Silent mutations at the predicted targets abolish miRNA activity, prevent the downregulation of the corresponding genes and delay the induced phenotype. Our findings demonstrate the abundance of CDS-located miRNA targets, some of which can be species-specific, and support an augmented model whereby animal miRNAs exercise their control on mRNAs through targets that can reside beyond the 3' untranslated region.
The signalling pathways controlling both the evolution and development of language in the human brain remain unknown. So far, the transcription factor FOXP2 (forkhead box P2) is the only gene implicated in Mendelian forms of human speech and language dysfunction. It has been proposed that the amino acid composition in the human variant of FOXP2 has undergone accelerated evolution, and this two-amino-acid change occurred around the time of language emergence in humans. However, this remains controversial, and whether the acquisition of these amino acids in human FOXP2 has any functional consequence in human neurons remains untested. Here we demonstrate that these two human-specific amino acids alter FOXP2 function by conferring differential transcriptional regulation in vitro. We extend these observations in vivo to human and chimpanzee brain, and use network analysis to identify novel relationships among the differentially expressed genes. These data provide experimental support for the functional relevance of changes in FOXP2 that occur on the human lineage, highlighting specific pathways with direct consequences for human brain development and disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Because FOXP2 has an important role in speech and language in humans, the identified targets may have a critical function in the development and evolution of language circuitry in humans.
Although it is known that the methylation of DNA in 5' promoters suppresses gene expression, the role of DNA methylation in gene bodies is unclear. In mammals, tissue- and cell type-specific methylation is present in a small percentage of 5' CpG island (CGI) promoters, whereas a far greater proportion occurs across gene bodies, coinciding with highly conserved sequences. Tissue-specific intragenic methylation might reduce, or, paradoxically, enhance transcription elongation efficiency. Capped analysis of gene expression (CAGE) experiments also indicate that transcription commonly initiates within and between genes. To investigate the role of intragenic methylation, we generated a map of DNA methylation from the human brain encompassing 24.7 million of the 28 million CpG sites. From the dense, high-resolution coverage of CpG islands, the majority of methylated CpG islands were shown to be in intragenic and intergenic regions, whereas less than 3% of CpG islands in 5' promoters were methylated. The CpG islands in all three locations overlapped with RNA markers of transcription initiation, and unmethylated CpG islands also overlapped significantly with trimethylation of H3K4, a histone modification enriched at promoters. The general and CpG-island-specific patterns of methylation are conserved in mouse tissues. An in-depth investigation of the human SHANK3 locus and its mouse homologue demonstrated that this tissue-specific DNA methylation regulates intragenic promoter activity in vitro and in vivo. These methylation-regulated, alternative transcripts are expressed in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner, and are expressed differentially within a single cell type from distinct brain regions. These results support a major role for intragenic methylation in regulating cell context-specific alternative promoters in gene bodies.
Intracellular membrane fusion is mediated by the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins. All vesicle transport steps also have an essential requirement for a member of the Sec1 protein family, including the neuronal Munc18-1 (also known as nSec1) in regulated exocytosis. Here, in adrenal chromaffin cells, we expressed a Munc18 mutant with reduced affinity for syntaxin, which specifically modified the kinetics of single-granule exocytotic release events, consistent with an acceleration of fusion pore expansion. Thus, Munc18 functions in a late stage in the fusion process, where its dissociation from syntaxin determines the kinetics of postfusion events.
The basal ganglia, of which the striatum is the major component, process inputs from virtually all cerebral cortical areas to affect motor, emotional, and cognitive behaviors. Insights into how these seemingly disparate functions may be integrated have emerged from studies that have demonstrated that the mammalian striatum is composed of two compartments arranged as a mosaic, the patches and the matrix, which differ in their neurochemical and neuroanatomical properties. In this study, projections from prefrontal, cingulate, and motor cortical areas to the striatal compartments were examined with the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) anterograde axonal tracer in rats. Each cortical area projects to both the patches and the matrix of the striatum; however, deep layer V and layer VI corticostriatal neurons project principally to the patches, whereas superficial layer V and layer III and II corticostriatal neurons project principally to the matrix. The relative contribution of patch and matrix corticostriatal projections varies among the cortical areas examined such that allocortical areas provide a greater number of inputs to the patches than to the matrix, whereas the reverse obtains for neocortical areas. These results demonstrate that the compartmental organization of corticostriatal inputs is related to their laminar origin and secondarily to the cytoarchitectonic area of origin.
Nerve growth factor plays an important part in neuron-target interactions in the late embryonic and adult brain. We now report that this growth factor controls the proliferation of neuronal precursors in a defined culture system of cells derived from the early embryonic brain. Neuronal precursor cells were identified by expression of the intermediate filament protein nestin. These cells proliferate in response to nerve growth factor but only after they have been exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor. On withdrawal of nerve growth factor, the proliferative cells differentiate into neurons. Thus, in combination with other growth factors, nerve growth factor regulates the proliferation and terminal differentiation of neuroepithelial stem cells.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple cell metabolism to electrical activity. Phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) profoundly antagonized ATP inhibition of KATP channels when applied to inside-out membrane patches. It is proposed that membrane-incorporated PIPs can bind to positive charges in the cytoplasmic region of the channel's Kir6.2 subunit, stabilizing the open state of the channel and antagonizing the inhibitory effect of ATP. The tremendous effect of PIPs on ATP sensitivity suggests that in vivo alterations of membrane PIP levels will have substantial effects on KATP channel activity and hence on the gain of metabolism-excitation coupling.
Neuromedin U (NMU) is a neuropeptide with potent activity on smooth muscle which was isolated first from porcine spinal cord and later from other species. It is widely distributed in the gut and central nervous system. Peripheral activities of NMU include stimulation of smooth muscle, increase of blood pressure, alteration of ion transport in the gut, control of local blood flow and regulation of adrenocortical function. An NMU receptor has not been molecularly identified. Here we show that the previously described orphan G-protein-coupled receptor FM-3 (ref. 15) and a newly discovered one (FM-4) are cognate receptors for NMU. FM-3, designated NMU1R, is abundantly expressed in peripheral tissues whereas FM-4, designated NMU2R, is expressed in specific regions of the brain. NMU is expressed in the ventromedial hypothalamus in the rat brain, and its level is significantly reduced following fasting. Intracerebroventricular administration of NMU markedly suppresses food intake in rats. These findings provide a molecular basis for the biochemical activities of NMU and may indicate that NMU is involved in the central control of feeding.
The ability of nerve cells to receive up to several thousands of synaptic inputs from other neurons provides the anatomical basis for information processing in the vertebrate brain. The formation of functional synapses involves selective clustering of neurotransmitter receptors at presumptive postsynaptic regions of the neuronal plasma membrane. Receptor-associated proteins are believed to be crucial for this process. In spinal neurons, synaptic targeting of the inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) depends on the expression of the anchoring protein gephyrin. Here we show that the competitive GlyR antagonist strychnine and L-type Ca2+-channel blockers inhibit the accumulation of GlyR and gephyrin at postsynaptic membrane areas in cultured rat spinal neurons. Our data are consistent with a model in which GlyR activation that results in Ca2+ influx is required for the clustering of gephyrin and GlyR at developing postsynaptic sites. Similar activity-driven mechanisms may be of general importance in synaptogenesis.
Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) can stimulate or inhibit growth of cells in vitro, as well as induce the transformed phenotype. Although widely distributed in animal tissue, the effects of TGF-beta in vivo are largely unknown, and a physiological role for the peptide hormone has not been demonstrated. The effect of TGF-beta on developing epithelial tissue in situ was studied by using slow-release plastic pellets containing TGF-beta to treat developing mouse mammary gland. Powerful inhibition of mammary growth and morphogenesis was observed. This growth-inhibited mammary tissue was histologically normal, and the inhibitory effect was fully reversible. Under the conditions of these experiments, TGF-beta displayed many of the characteristics expected of a physiologically active growth-regulatory molecule.
The striatum (caudate-putamen) of the basal ganglia in the mammalian forebrain is a mosaic of two interdigitating, neurochemically distinct compartments. One type, the 'patch' compartment, is identified by patches of dense opiate receptor binding, and is enriched in enkephalin- and substance P-like immunoreactivity. The other compartment, the 'matrix', has a high acetylcholinesterase activity, and is shown here to have a dense plexus of fibres displaying somatostatin-like immunoreactivity. The present study demonstrates the two compartments have distinct connections, using a method that concurrently reveals striatal input, output and neurochemical systems in the rat. Patches receive inputs from the prelimbic cortex (a medial frontal cortical area with direct 'limbic' inputs from the amygdala and hippocampus); they also project to the substantia nigra pars compacta (the source of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system). Conversely, the matrix receives inputs from sensory and motor cortical areas; here it is shown to project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (the source of the non-dopaminergic nigrothalamic and nigrotectal system). Also, an intrinsic striatal somatostatin-immunoreactive system is described that may provide a link between the two compartments. The striatal patch and matrix compartments thus appear to be functionally distinct and interactive parallel input-output processing channels.
Experiences are remembered or forgotten, but the neural determinants for the mnemonic fate of experience are unknown. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify specific brain activations that differentiated between visual experiences that were later remembered well, remembered less well, or forgotten. During scanning of medial temporal lobe and frontal lobe regions, subjects viewed complex, color photographs. Subjects later received a test of memory for the photographs. The magnitudes of focal activations in right prefrontal cortex and in bilateral parahippocampal cortex predicted which photographs were later remembered well, remembered less well, or forgotten.
In echolocating bats, the primary cue for determining distance to a target is the interval between an emitted orientation sound and its echo. Whereas frequency is represented by place in the bat cochlea, no anatomical location represents of primary range. Target range is coded by the time interval between grouped discharges of primary auditory neurons in response to both the emitted sound and its echo. In the frequency-modulated-signal processing area of the auditory cortex of the mustache bat (Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus), neurons respond poorly or not at all to synthesized orientation sounds or echoes alone but respond vigorously to echoes following the emitted sound with a specific delay from targets at a specific range. These range-tuned neurons are systemically arranged along the rostrocaudal axis of the frequency-modulated-signal processing area according to the delays to which they best respond, and thus represent target range in terms of cortical organization. The frequency-modulated-signal processing area therefore shows odotopic representation.
Tyrosine kinase receptors stimulate the Ras signalling pathway by enhancing the activity of the SOS nucleotide-exchange factor. This occurs, at least in part, by the recruitment of an SOS-GRB2 complex to Ras in the plasma membrane. Here we describe a different signalling pathway to Ras that involves activation of the Ras-GRF exchange factor in response to Ca2+ influx. In particular, we show that the ability of Ras-GRF to activate Ras in vivo is markedly enhanced by raised Ca2+ concentrations. Activation is mediated by calmodulin binding to an IQ motif in Ras-GRF, because substitutions in conserved amino acids in this motif prevent both calmodulin binding to Ras-GRF and Ras-GRF activation in vivo. So far, full-length Ras-GRF has been detected only in brain neurons. Our findings implicate Ras-GRF in the regulation of neuronal functions that are influenced by Ca2+ signals.
Dopamine-beta- hydroxylase is an enzyme that is localized to catecholamine-containing vesicles in sympathetic nerves and the adrenal medulla, and is also found in the serum. Treatment of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine, a drug which destroys sympathetic nerve terminals, leads to a decrease in serum dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity. The decrease is not due to an effect on the adrenal medulla or to an increase in circulating inhibitor or inhibitors of enzyme. These data represent evidence that at least a portion of the circulating dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity arises from sympathetic nerve terminals.
In the neocortex, each neuron receives thousands of synaptic inputs distributed across an extensive dendritic tree. Although postsynaptic processing of each input is known to depend on its dendritic location, it is unclear whether activity-dependent synaptic modification is also location-dependent. Here we report that both the magnitude and the temporal specificity of spike-timing-dependent synaptic modification vary along the apical dendrite of rat cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. At the distal dendrite, the magnitude of long-term potentiation is smaller, and the window of pre-/postsynaptic spike interval for long-term depression (LTD) is broader. The spike-timing window for LTD correlates with the window of action potential-induced suppression of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors; this correlation applies to both their dendritic location-dependence and pharmacological properties. Presynaptic stimulation with partial blockade of NMDA receptors induced LTD and occluded further induction of spike-timing-dependent LTD, suggesting that NMDA receptor suppression underlies LTD induction. Computer simulation studies showed that the dendritic inhomogeneity of spike-timing-dependent synaptic modification leads to differential input selection at distal and proximal dendrites according to the temporal characteristics of presynaptic spike trains. Such location-dependent tuning of inputs, together with the dendritic heterogeneity of postsynaptic processing, could enhance the computational capacity of cortical pyramidal neurons.
The production of specialized differentiated neurons derived from stem cells has been proposed as a revolutionary technology for regenerative medicine. However, few examples of specific neuronal cell differentiation have been described so far. Although stem-cell tissue replacement might be seemingly straightforward in other cases, the high degree of complexity of the nervous system raises the challenge of tissue replacement substantially. Understanding mechanisms of neuronal diversification will not only be relevant for therapeutic purposes but might also shed light on the differences in cognitive abilities, personality traits and psychiatric conditions observed in humans.
Insulin rapidly stimulates glucose use in the major target tissues, muscle and fat, by modulating a tissue-specific glucose transporter isoform. Access of glucose to the target tissue is restricted by endothelial cells which line the walls of nonfenestrated capillaries of fat and muscle. Thus, we examined whether the capillary endothelial cells are actively involved in the modulation of glucose availability by these tissues. We report here the abundant expression of the muscle/fat glucose transporter isoform in endothelial cells, using an immunocytochemical analysis with a monoclonal antibody specific for this isoform. This expression is restricted to endothelial cells from the major insulin target tissues, and it is not detected in brain and liver where insulin does not activate glucose transport. The expression of the muscle/fat transporter isoform in endothelial cells is significantly greater than in the neighbouring muscle and fat cells. Following administration of insulin to animals in vivo, there occurs a rapid increase in the number of muscle/fat transporters present in the lumenal plasma membrane of the capillary endothelial cells. These results document that insulin promotes the translocation of the muscle/fat glucose transporter in endothelial cells. It is therefore likely that endothelial cells play an important role in the regulation of glucose use by the major insulin target tissues in normal and diseased states.
Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.
GAP-43 is one of a small subset of cellular proteins selectively transported by a neuron to its terminals. Its enrichment in growth cones and its increased levels in developing or regenerating neurons suggest that it has an important role in neurite growth. A complementary DNA (cDNA) that encodes rat GAP-43 has been isolated to study its structural characteristics and regulation. The predicted molecular size is 24 kilodaltons, although its migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gels is anomalously retarded. Expression of GAP-43 is limited to the nervous system, where its levels are highest during periods of neurite outgrowth. Nerve growth factor or adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate induction of neurites from PC12 cells is accompanied by increased GAP-43 expression. GAP-43 RNA is easily detectable, although at diminished levels, in the adult rat nervous system. This regulation of GAP-43 is concordant with a role in growth-related processes of the neuron, processes that may continue in the mature animal.
Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are key enzymes in signal-transduction pathways for a wide range of cellular processes. PTKs and PTPs are highly expressed in the central nervous system, which is consistent with the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in neuronal function. Protein phosphorylation is known to be involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter receptors, but the effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on neurotransmitter receptor function in the central nervous system are unknown. Here we present evidence that in mammalian central neurons tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the function of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, a subtype of excitatory amino-acid receptor. NMDA-receptor-mediated whole-cell currents and intracellular Ca2+ responses are depressed by inhibition of PTKs. Conversely, NMDA currents are potentiated by intracellular application of the well characterized PTK pp60c-src. NMDA currents are also potentiated by intracellular administration of an inhibitor of PTPs. Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is a new mechanism for regulating NMDA receptors and may be important in neuronal development, plasticity and toxicity.
Sensory experiences exert a powerful influence on the function and future performance of neuronal circuits in the mammalian neocortex. Restructuring of synaptic connections is believed to be one mechanism by which cortical circuits store information about the sensory world. Excitatory synaptic structures, such as dendritic spines, are dynamic entities that remain sensitive to alteration of sensory input throughout life. It remains unclear, however, whether structural changes at the level of dendritic spines can outlast the original experience and thereby provide a morphological basis for long-term information storage. Here we follow spine dynamics on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in functionally defined regions of adult mouse visual cortex during plasticity of eye-specific responses induced by repeated closure of one eye (monocular deprivation). The first monocular deprivation episode doubled the rate of spine formation, thereby increasing spine density. This effect was specific to layer-5 cells located in binocular cortex, where most neurons increase their responsiveness to the non-deprived eye. Restoring binocular vision returned spine dynamics to baseline levels, but absolute spine density remained elevated and many monocular deprivation-induced spines persisted during this period of functional recovery. However, spine addition did not increase again when the same eye was closed for a second time. This absence of structural plasticity stands out against the robust changes of eye-specific responses that occur even faster after repeated deprivation. Thus, spines added during the first monocular deprivation experience may provide a structural basis for subsequent functional shifts. These results provide a strong link between functional plasticity and specific synaptic rearrangements, revealing a mechanism of how prior experiences could be stored in cortical circuits.
Most natural actions are chosen voluntarily from many possible choices. An action is often chosen based on the reward that it is expected to produce. What kind of cellular activity in which area of the cerebral cortex is involved in selecting an action according to the expected reward value? Results of an analysis in monkeys of cellular activity during the performance of reward-based motor selection and the effects of chemical inactivation are presented. We suggest that cells in the rostral cingulate motor area, one of the higher order motor areas in the cortex, play a part in processing the reward information for motor selection.
A direct method has been employed to estimate the rate of production by human brain of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol, the major metabolite of brain norepinephrine, a brain neurotransmitter. Venous specimens were obtained from the internal jugular vein from ten awake human subjects at a puncture site above the common facial vein, the first major source of extracranial inflow. Arterial specimens were simultaneously obtained from the radial artery. Plasma samples were assayed and a highly significant difference was found in the concentration of the metabolite in plasma coming out of the brain (venous blood) as compared to plasma entering the brain (arterial blood). This venous-arterial difference was calculated to be 0.7 +/- 0.1 nanogram per milliliter of blood. Assuming an adult brain weight of 1400 grams and normal cerebral blood flow, it is estimated that the rate of production of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol by the awake human brain is approximately 597 nanograms per minute or 35.8 micrograms per hour. Urine specimens were also collected from six of these subjects during a period of 1 to 3.5 hours, which bracketed the time the blood samples were obtained. For these six subjects the output of 3-methyoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol by whole brain was estimated to be 40.9 micrograms per hour, whereas the rate of its excretion into urine was 64.5 micrograms per hour.
Insulin is a polypeptide hormone of major physiological importance in the regulation of fuel homeostasis in animals (reviewed in refs 1,2). It is synthesized by the beta-cells of pancreatic islets, and circulating insulin levels are regulated by several small molecules, notably glucose, amino acids, fatty acids and certain pharmacological agents. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B, linked by disulphide bonds) that are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of proinsulin, generating equimolar amounts of the mature insulin and a connecting peptide (C-peptide). Humans, like most vertebrates, contain one proinsulin gene, although several species, including mice and rats, have two highly homologous insulin genes. We have studied the regulation of serum insulin levels and of insulin gene expression by generating a series of transgenic mice containing the human insulin gene. We report here that the human insulin gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the islets of these transgenic mice, and that serum human insulin levels are properly regulated by glucose, amino acids and tolbutamide, an oral hypoglycaemic agent.
A specific immunofluorescent histochemical method for cyclic adenosine monophosphate was used to study rat cerebellum. After topical treatment with norepinephrine or stimulation of norepinephrine-containing afferents from locus coeruleus, there was a striking increase in the number of Purkinje cells with strong cyclic adenosine monophosphate reactivity. Other putative inhibitory transmitters had no significant effect on staining of Purkinje cells. The results provide the first histochemical support for the hypothesis that cyclic adenosine monophosphate can be generated postsynaptically in central neurons in response to noradrenergic stimuli.
Human peripheral blood leukocyte cultures containing varying numbers of washed fresh sperm were cultured for 4 days. [3H] Thymidine incorporation was used as a measure of lymphocyte transformation. Human sperm cells induce a 4- to 250-fold increase in [3H] thymidine incorporation in allogeneic leuocyte cultures, but no increase was demonstrated in autologous leukocyte cultures. The response was dose-dependent with maximum stimulation obtained at 2 x 10(6) sperm per milliliter of culture. Seminal plasma was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion and as little as 0.2 microliter per 200 microliters of culture was inhibitory. The data indicate that tissues other than leukocytes can express the portion of the major histocompatibility complex responsibile for allospecific lymphocyte transformation, and thus have application in transplantation and reproductive biology.
Depletion of dopamine in a circumscribed area of association cortex in rhesus monkeys produces an impairment in spatial delayed alternation performance nearly as severe as that caused by surgical ablation of the same area. This behavioral deficit can be pharmacologically reversed with dopamine agonists such as L-dopa and apomorphine. These data provide direct evidence that dopamine plays an important role in a specific cortical function.
The tonic flexor muscles of the crayfish abdomen respond with a large depolarizing potential to acetylcholine iontophoresed onto a neuromuscular Junction, but not to glutamate. Excitatory junctional potentials are abolished by d-tubocurarine and enhanced by a cholinesterase inhibitor. The membrane is depolarized and the junctional potentials are desensitized by excess acetylcholine. Thus acetylcholine is thought to be the neuromuscular transmitter.
Volumetric estimates of the total number of granule cells in rats 30, 120, 200, and 365 days old increase linearly by approximately 35 to 43 percent between 1 month and 1 year. Total volume of the granular layer also grows linearly during that time. These results demonstrate a numerical increase in a neuronal population during adulthood in the mammalian brain.
Down's syndrome (DS) or trisomy 21 is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. Development of the DS brain is associated with decreased neuronal number and abnormal neuronal differentiation, and adults with DS develop Alzheimer's disease. The cause of the neurodegenerative process in DS is unknown. Here we report that cortical neurons from fetal DS and age-matched normal brain differentiate normally in culture, but DS neurons subsequently degenerate and undergo apoptosis whereas normal neurons remain viable. Degeneration of DS neurons is prevented by treatment with free-radical scavengers or catalase. Furthermore, DS neurons exhibit a three- to fourfold increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species and elevated levels of lipid peroxidation that precede neuronal death. These results suggest that DS neurons have a defect in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species that causes neuronal apoptosis. This defect may contribute to mental retardation early in life and predispose to Alzheimer's disease in adults.
Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanding polyglutamine repeat in the IT15 or huntingtin gene. Although this gene is widely expressed and is required for normal development, the pathology of HD is restricted to the brain, for reasons that remain poorly understood. The huntingtin gene product is expressed at similar levels in patients and controls, and the genetics of the disorder suggest that the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat induces a toxic gain of function, perhaps through interactions with other cellular proteins. Here we report the identification of a protein (huntingtin-associated protein (HAP)-1) that binds to huntingtin. This binding is enhanced by an expanded polyglutamine repeat, the length of which is also known to correlate with the age of disease onset. The HAP-1 protein is enriched in the brain, suggesting a possible basis for the selective brain pathology of HD.
Viruses have been shown to cause bone marrow aplasia in animals and have been implicated in bone marrow failure in man; however, until recently, a specific link between human viral infection and bone marrow failure has not been proven. In 1975 Cossart and colleagues found a serum parvovirus-like virus (SPLV, sometimes referred to as B19) in human serum. Antibody to this virus is present in the sera of 30-45% of healthy adults (Y. E. Cossart, P. P. Mortimer, unpublished observations). However, evidence for a direct link came from work by Pattison et al. who found five children with transient aplastic crisis of sickle cell disease and evidence of active infection with SPLV. This association was later confirmed in a large series of children with sickle cell disease and aplastic crisis in Jamaica. We have studied the effects of virus-containing material on haematopoiesis, using in vitro colony-forming assays to look for direct evidence for a role of SPLV in bone marrow aplasia. We show here that SPLV-containing sera inhibit erythropoiesis in culture. Moreover, in a child with hereditary spherocytosis who developed transient aplastic crisis, a strong inhibitory effect of the patient's serum on erythropoiesis correlated with the presence of virus.
Neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system are often associated with impaired learning and memory, eventually leading to dementia. An important aspect in pre-clinical research is the exploration of strategies to re-establish learning ability and access to long-term memories. By using a mouse model that allows temporally and spatially restricted induction of neuronal loss, we show here that environmental enrichment reinstated learning behaviour and re-established access to long-term memories after significant brain atrophy and neuronal loss had already occurred. Environmental enrichment correlated with chromatin modifications (increased histone-tail acetylation). Moreover, increased histone acetylation by inhibitors of histone deacetylases induced sprouting of dendrites, an increased number of synapses, and reinstated learning behaviour and access to long-term memories. These data suggest that inhibition of histone deacetylases might be a suitable therapeutic avenue for neurodegenerative diseases associated with learning and memory impairment, and raises the possibility of recovery of long-term memories in patients with dementia.
Long-term treatment of rats with clinically effective tricyclic antidepressant drugs induced a selective increase in the inhibitory response of forebrain neurons to serotonin applied by microiontophoresis. Long-term administration of some related drugs which lack antidepressant efficacy failed to induce such a change. The enhanced response to serotonin induced by the clinically active tricyclic drugs took 1 to 2 weeks to develop, a time course which correlates with the delayed onset of therapeutic effects in humans.
Stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors in cardiac ventricular myocytes activates a strong chloride ion conductance as a result of phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). This Cl- conductance, which is time- and voltage-independent, counters the tendency of the simultaneously enhanced Ca2+ channel current to prolong the ventricular action potential. Using inside-out giant patches excised from guinea-pig myocytes, we show here that phosphorylation by the PKA catalytic subunit plus Mg-ATP elicits discrete Cl- channel currents. In almost symmetrical Cl- solutions (approximately 150 mM), unitary current amplitude scales with membrane potential, and reverses sign near 0 mV, to yield a single channel conductance of approximately 12 pS. Opening of the phosphorylated channels requires hydrolysable nucleoside triphosphate, indicating that phosphorylation by PKA is necessary, but not sufficient, for channel activation. The properties of these PKA-regulated cardiac Cl- channels are very similar, if not identical, to those of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the epithelial cell Cl- channel whose regulation is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis. The full cardiological impact of these Cl- channels and of their possible malfunction in patients with cystic fibrosis remains to be determined.
Whether social comparison affects individual well-being is of central importance for understanding behavior in any social environment. Traditional economic theories focus on the role of absolute rewards, whereas behavioral evidence suggests that social comparisons influence well-being and decisions. We investigated the impact of social comparisons on reward-related brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While being scanned in two adjacent MRI scanners, pairs of subjects had to simultaneously perform a simple estimation task that entailed monetary rewards for correct answers. We show that a variation in the comparison subject's payment affects blood oxygenation level-dependent responses in the ventral striatum. Our results provide neurophysiological evidence for the importance of social comparison on reward processing in the human brain.
Measuring the fluorescence of dyes specific for calcium and other cations allows the elucidation of cellular mechanisms such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction and cardiovascular regulation.
Expression of c-myb proto-oncogene messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein has been detected principally in tumors and in normal tissue of hematopoietic origin. In each hematopoietic lineage examined, expression of the c-myb gene is markedly downregulated during hematopoietic maturation. However, the mechanism by which differential expression of the c-myb gene is regulated is not known. In murine B-lymphoid tumor cell lines, the amount of steady-state c-myb mRNA is 10 to more than 100 times greater in pre-B cell lymphomas than in B cell lymphomas and plasmacytomas. The downregulation of c-myb mRNA correlates with events at the pre-B cell-B cell junction. Differential expression of c-myb mRNA levels detected between a pre-B cell lymphoma and a mature B cell lymphoma is now shown to be mediated by a block to transcription elongation in the first intron of the c-myb locus. In addition, this developmentally regulated difference in transcriptional activity is correlated with alterations in higher order chromatin structure as reflected by changes in the patterns of hypersensitivity to deoxyribonuclease I at the 5' end of the c-myb transcription unit. Regulation of transcription elongation may provide a more sensitive mechanism for rapidly increasing and decreasing mRNA levels in response to external stimuli than regulation of the initiation of transcription.
The lateral hypothalamus is a brain region historically implicated in reward and motivation, but the identity of the neurotransmitters involved are unknown. The orexins (or hypocretins) are neuropeptides recently identified as neurotransmitters in lateral hypothalamus neurons. Although knockout and transgenic overexpression studies have implicated orexin neurons in arousal and sleep, these cells also project to reward-associated brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. This indicates a possible role for these neurons in reward function and motivation, consistent with previous studies implicating these neurons in feeding. Here we show that activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons is strongly linked to preferences for cues associated with drug and food reward. In addition, we show that chemical activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons reinstates an extinguished drug-seeking behaviour. This reinstatement effect was completely blocked by prior administration of an orexin A antagonist. Moreover, administration of the orexin A peptide directly into the ventral tegmental area also reinstated drug-seeking. These data reveal a new role for lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons in reward-seeking, drug relapse and addiction.
Converging evidence and new research methodologies from across the neurosciences permit the neuroscientific study of the role of sleep in off-line memory reprocessing, as well as the nature and function of dreaming. Evidence supports a role for sleep in the consolidation of an array of learning and memory tasks. In addition, new methodologies allow the experimental manipulation of dream content at sleep onset, permitting an objective and scientific study of this dream formation and a renewed search for the possible functions of dreaming and the biological processes subserving it.
Using sensory information for the prediction of future events is essential for survival. Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by environmental cues that predict rewards, but the cellular mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain elusive. We used in vivo voltammetry and in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology to show that both dopamine release to reward predictive cues and enhanced synaptic strength onto dopamine neurons develop over the course of cue-reward learning. Increased synaptic strength was not observed after stable behavioral responding. Thus, enhanced synaptic strength onto dopamine neurons may act to facilitate the transformation of neutral environmental stimuli to salient reward-predictive cues.
Songbirds are capable of vocal learning and communication and are ideally suited to the study of neural mechanisms of complex sensory and motor processing. Vocal communication in a noisy bird colony and vocal learning of a specific song template both require the ability to monitor auditory feedback to distinguish self-generated vocalizations from external sounds and to identify mismatches between the developing song and a memorized template acquired from a tutor. However, neurons that respond to auditory feedback from vocal output have not been found in song-control areas despite intensive searching. Here we investigate feedback processing outside the traditional song system, in single auditory forebrain neurons of juvenile zebra finches that were in a late developmental stage of song learning. Overall, we found similarity of spike responses during singing and during playback of the bird's own song, with song responses commonly leading by a few milliseconds. However, brief time-locked acoustic perturbations of auditory feedback revealed complex sensitivity that could not be predicted from passive playback responses. Some neurons that responded to playback perturbations did not respond to song perturbations, which is reminiscent of sensory-motor mirror neurons. By contrast, some neurons were highly feedback sensitive in that they responded vigorously to song perturbations, but not to unperturbed songs or perturbed playback. These findings suggest that a computational function of forebrain auditory areas may be to detect errors between actual feedback and mirrored feedback deriving from an internal model of the bird's own song or that of its tutor. Such feedback-sensitive spikes could constitute the key signals that trigger adaptive motor responses to song disruptions or reinforce exploratory motor gestures for vocal learning.
After intravenous injection, cytochrome c does not enter the cerebrospinal fluid. In most areas of the brain, the marker is prevented from leaving cerebral vessels by the capillary endothelium. In the choroid plexus, the marker passes freely out of capillaries into the extracellular space. However, it does not traverse tight junctions between epithelial cells and is rapidly incorporated into mnembrane-bound vesicles within the cell cytoplasm. Thereafter, cytochrome c is apparently removed by lysosomal degradation. These data suggest that there are at least two morphologically distinct blood-brain barriers to cytochrome c and that pinocytosis may be a mechanism for intracellular degradation rather than transcellular transport.
Most of the world's cod (Gadus morhua) fisheries are now tightly regulated or closed altogether. Being able to link individual fish to their population of origin would assist enormously in policing regulations and in identifying poachers. Here we show that microsatellite genetic markers can be used to assign individual cod from three different populations in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean to their population of origin.
The hypoglossal motor neurons that innervate the vocal organ (syrinx) of the male zebra finch show a selective, long-latency (50-millisecond) response to sound. This response is eliminated by lesions to forebrain song-control nuclei. Different song syllables elicit a response from different syringeal motor neurons. Conspecific vocalizations may therefore be perceived as members of a set of vocal gestures and thus distinct from other environmental sounds. This hypothesis is an avian parallel to the motor theory of speech perception in humans.
Cholecystokinin (CCK) is the parent molecule of a family of polypeptide hormones, some of which are secreted from the small intestine after food ingestion and stimulate both exocrine secretion and gall bladder contraction. CCK-like molecules have also been identified in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The significance of CCK in the brain is unknown, but it could mediate satiety. The satiety produced by introduction of food into the intestine can be mimicked by systemic injections of CCK and its analogues-these hormones are also effective when injected into the hypothalamus and the cerebral ventricle. Straus and Yalow showed that brain CCK levels were reduced in the cerebral cortex of both genetically obese (ob/ob) and normal mice after a 2-5-day fast. However, Schneider detected no such reduction in similar conditions and other studies have suggested a peripheral rather than central action on satiety. Using CCK of high specific activity, specific CCK receptors have been measured both in pancreatic acini and in various brain regions. We show here that fasting in mice significantly increases CCK binding due to an increased number of CCK receptors in the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus, but not in other brain regions. In contrast, insulin binding to its receptors was not altered by fasting. As the hypothalamus is known to regulate appetite, this finding supports the concept that CCK regulates satiety through interaction with this brain region.
Neurotrophic factors participate in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Application of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a protein that promotes survival of motor neurons, resulted in an immediate potentiation of spontaneous and impulse-evoked transmitter release at developing neuromuscular synapses in Xenopus cell cultures. When CNTF was applied at the synapse, the onset of the potentiation was slower than that produced by application at the cell body of the presynaptic neuron. The potentiation effect was abolished when the neurite shaft was severed from the cell body. Thus, transmitter secretion from the nerve terminals is under immediate somatic control and can be regulated by CNTF.
The motion after-effect occurs after prolonged viewing of motion; a subsequent stationary scene is perceived as moving in the opposite direction. This illusion is thought to arise because motion is represented by the differential activities of populations of cortical neurons tuned to opposite directions; fatigue in one population leads to an imbalance that favours the opposite direction once the stimulus ceases. Following adaptation to multiple directions of motion, the after-effect is unidirectional, indicating that motion signals are integrated across all directions. Yet humans can perceive several directions of motion simultaneously. The question therefore arises as to how the visual system can perform both sharp segregation and global integration of motion signals. Here we show in computer simulations that this can occur if excitatory interactions between different directions are sharply tuned while inhibitory interactions are broadly tuned. Our model predicts that adaptation to simultaneous motion in opposite directions will lead to an orthogonal motion after-effect. This prediction was confirmed in psychophysical experiments. Thus, broadly tuned inhibitory interactions are likely to be important in the integration and segregation of motion signals. These interactions may occur in the cortical area MT, which contains motion-sensitive neurons with properties similar to those required by our model.
The central pattern generator for swimming in the pteropod mollusk Clione limacina consists of at least four pedal interneurons, two each controlling parapodial upstroke and downstroke. The two sets of antagonistic interneurons are linked by reciprocal monosynaptic inhibitory synapses, and all exhibit apparently strong postinhibitory rebound. This simple neuronal network produces reverberating alternate cyclic activity in the absence of tonic drive or apparent feedback modulation.
Vertebrate neural crest cells, derived from the neural folds, generate a variety of tissues, such as cartilage, ganglia, and cranial (intramembranous) bone. The chick homolog of the helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator Id2 is expressed in cranial but not trunk neural folds and subsequently in some migrating cranial neural crest cells. Ectopic expression of Id2 with recombinant retroviruses converted ectodermal cells to a neural crest fate, demonstrating that proper regulation of Id2 is important for sustaining epidermal traits. In addition, overexpression of Id2 resulted in overgrowth and premature neurogenesis of the dorsal neural tube. These results suggest that Id2 may allocate ectodermal precursors into neural rather than epidermal lineages.
Some 30,000 genes are expressed exclusively in the rat brain, many of which contain a genetic element called an identifier sequence located in at least one of their introns. The identifier sequences are transcribed by RNA polymerase III exclusively in neurons to produce two RNA species, BC1 and BC2, of 160 and 100 to 110 nucleotides. This transcriptional event may define regions of chromatin that contain neuronal-specific genes and may poise these genes for transcription by polymerase II by rendering the gene promoters accessible to soluble trans-acting molecules.
Complementary DNAs for three different muscarinic acetylcholine receptors were isolated from a rat cerebral cortex library, and the cloned receptors were expressed in mammalian cells. Analysis of human and rat genomic clones indicates that there are at least four functional muscarinic receptor genes and that these genes lack introns in the coding sequence. This gene family provides a new basis for evaluating the diversity of muscarinic mechanisms in the nervous system.
Glucocorticoids are released in response to stressful experiences and serve many beneficial homeostatic functions. However, dysregulation of glucocorticoids is associated with cognitive impairments and depressive illness. In the hippocampus, a brain region densely populated with receptors for stress hormones, stress and glucocorticoids strongly inhibit adult neurogenesis. Decreased neurogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression, but direct evidence for this role is lacking. Here we show that adult-born hippocampal neurons are required for normal expression of the endocrine and behavioural components of the stress response. Using either transgenic or radiation methods to inhibit adult neurogenesis specifically, we find that glucocorticoid levels are slower to recover after moderate stress and are less suppressed by dexamethasone in neurogenesis-deficient mice than intact mice, consistent with a role for the hippocampus in regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Relative to controls, neurogenesis-deficient mice also showed increased food avoidance in a novel environment after acute stress, increased behavioural despair in the forced swim test, and decreased sucrose preference, a measure of anhedonia. These findings identify a small subset of neurons within the dentate gyrus that are critical for hippocampal negative control of the HPA axis and support a direct role for adult neurogenesis in depressive illness.
The NF-kappa B subunits p50 and p65 and the product of the rel proto-oncogene are members of a growing class of transcription factors with a unique DNA-binding and dimerization domain. Nuclear transfer of each of these factors is controlled by cytoplasmic inhibitors, and regulated by specific stimuli. The inhibitors I kappa B-alpha and -beta and pp40 recognize either p65 or the c-rel protein. We show here that the proto-oncogene bcl-3, believed to be involved in certain human B-cell leukaemias, encodes a protein that functions as an I kappa B-like molecule for native NF-kappa B but is specific for the p50 subunit. The ankyrin repeat domain of the bcl-3 product is shown to mediate complex formation with NF-kappa B dimers by contracting the conserved dimerization domain of NF-kappa B.
It has been found that cells in the region of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus are sensitive to osmotic stimuli in a physiological range, and have studied the mechanism by which the osmotic sensitivity arises. An in vitro hypothalamic brain slice preparation has been used to make intracellular recordings from the SON. Cells lying in the SON respond to small increases (9--40 mosmol l-1) in the osmolarity of their external environment with a marked increase in firing rate. They respond to NaCl and mannitol although not to glucose. The osmotic sensitivity of SON neurones has a complex origin at both a pre- and a postsynaptic level, being composed first of depolarization of the primary SON neurone by an increase of extracellular osmolarity and second by an increased rate of occurrence of excitatory synaptic events which markedly augment firing rate. These results are consistent with Jewell and Verney's suggestion that osmoreception in the mammalian brain occurs in the region of the anterior hypothalamus, and extends this localization by indicating that the SON neurones are themselves both directly osmosensitive and part of an osmoreceptive complex.
Recently, in addition to conventional neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), putative neuroactive peptide transmitters have been localized to specific retinal amacrine cells. In particular, opiate receptors 2,3, assayable enkephalin immunoreactivity and enkephalin-immunoreactive neurones 1,5 have been described in avian and mammalian retinae. However, little physiological evidence has been obtained for the involvement of neuropeptides in retinal function. Here we report that exogenous opiates affect both the release of GABA from GABAergic amacrine cells and the firing patterns of ganglion cells in the goldfish retina. Our results show that the output of the retina is modulated by an opiate system whose neural organization and pharmacological properties resemble those described elsewhere in the vertebrate central nervous system.
An alcoholic extract of Solanum dulcamara L., a plant widely used in folk medicine for treating cancers and warts, shows tumor-inhibitory activity against Sarcoma 180 in mice. Systematic fractionation of the extract has led to isolation and characterization of beta-solamarine as an active principle.
In primary visual cortex of higher mammals neurons are grouped according to their orientation preference, forming "pinwheels" around "orientation centers." Although the general structure of orientation maps is largely resolved, the microscopic arrangement of neuronal response properties in the orientation centers has remained elusive. The tetrode technique, enabling multiple single-unit recordings, in combination with intrinsic signal imaging was used to reveal the fine-grain structure of orientation maps in these locations. The results show that orientation centers represent locations where orientation columns converge containing normal, sharply tuned neurons of different orientation preference lying in close proximity.
The activity of many proteins in eukaryotic cells is regulated by reversible covalent phosphorylation. This regulatory modification is often linked to other allosteric controls within the same protein, and such overlapping regulatory mechanisms are best characterized for glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1). Phosphorylases from different organisms or cell types exhibit markedly contrasting regulatory features; this makes the enzyme attractive for studying the evolution of interacting molecular regulatory mechanisms. Extensive biochemical and crystallographic studies of rabbit muscle phosphorylase have led to a characterization of five regulatory regions (phosphorylation, glycogen storage, AMP, glucose and purine sites). Here we report the complete primary structure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycogen phosphorylase, deduced from the sequence of the cloned gene. Regions that are highly conserved between muscle and yeast enzymes include the active site, the glycogen storage site and possibly the glucose and purine inhibition sites. Partial conservation of the residues involved in AMP-binding suggests a binding site for the yeast enzyme inhibitor, glucose 6-phosphate. Other parts of the AMP site and the intersubunit contacts involved in AMP allostery are disrupted in the yeast enzyme by extreme sequence divergence. The poor alignment of amino termini and lack of homology at phosphorylation sites indicate that regulation by reversible phosphorylation evolved independently in yeast and vertebrate phosphorylases.
Extrachromosomal elements that are stably maintained at a constant copy number through cell doublings are a good model system for the study of the regulation of DNA replication in higher eukaryotes. Previous studies have defined both cis and trans functions required for the regulated plasmid replication of the bovine papilloma virus in stably transformed cells. Here, a sequence known to be a cis-dominant element of the replication origin of the plasmid is shown to contain a promoter for transcription. Both in vitro and in vivo assays have been used to define this promoter and show that a sequence located just 3' to the transcriptional start site is required for activity. This DNA sequence element, which has been defined through deletions, coincides with a binding site for a cellular factor and is also required for a functional origin of replication. Possible models for how a transcription factor may play a role in the regulation of DNA replication are discussed.
The mammalian brain exhibits diverse types of neural plasticity, including activity-dependent neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. How transient activation of mature neurons leads to long-lasting modulation of adult neurogenesis is unknown. Here we identify Gadd45b as a neural activity-induced immediate early gene in mature hippocampal neurons. Mice with Gadd45b deletion exhibit specific deficits in neural activity-induced proliferation of neural progenitors and dendritic growth of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus. Mechanistically, Gadd45b is required for activity-induced DNA demethylation of specific promoters and expression of corresponding genes critical for adult neurogenesis, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor. Thus, Gadd45b links neuronal circuit activity to epigenetic DNA modification and expression of secreted factors in mature neurons for extrinsic modulation of neurogenesis in the adult brain.
The traditional approach to studying brain function is to measure physiological responses to controlled sensory, motor and cognitive paradigms. However, most of the brain's energy consumption is devoted to ongoing metabolic activity not clearly associated with any particular stimulus or behaviour. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans aimed at understanding this ongoing activity have shown that spontaneous fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal occur continuously in the resting state. In humans, these fluctuations are temporally coherent within widely distributed cortical systems that recapitulate the functional architecture of responses evoked by experimentally administered tasks. Here, we show that the same phenomenon is present in anaesthetized monkeys even at anaesthetic levels known to induce profound loss of consciousness. We specifically demonstrate coherent spontaneous fluctuations within three well known systems (oculomotor, somatomotor and visual) and the 'default' system, a set of brain regions thought by some to support uniquely human capabilities. Our results indicate that coherent system fluctuations probably reflect an evolutionarily conserved aspect of brain functional organization that transcends levels of consciousness.
Resting B cells express few, if any, receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2), whereas activated B cells can express receptors for and respond to IL-2. IL-2 receptors can exist on the cell surface in three different forms; the complete high-affinity receptor, a heterodimer consisting of a chain of relative molecular mass (Mr) 70-75,000 (70-75K) and a chain of Mr 55K; the 70-75K chain alone, with intermediate affinity for IL-2; or the 55K chain alone, with low affinity for IL-2. We have previously reported that IL-5-stimulated B cells are induced to express the 55K chain. We report here evidence for the differential regulation of the expression of the two chains, namely that IL-4 and IL-5 can independently induce expression of the 70-75K and 55K chains respectively on murine B cells. As expected, cells stimulated to express the 55K chain alone are unresponsive to IL-2, whereas cells stimulated to express either the 70-75K chain or the 70-75/55K heterodimer respond to IL-2, at a high and low ligand concentration respectively, with a marked increase in proliferation. This orchestration of receptor expression and factor responsiveness may represent a novel activation pathway for B cells, where the two chains of a compound receptor are shown to be independently regulated.
Adenosine is present in the mammalian brain in large amounts and has potent effects on neuronal activity, but its role in neural signaling is poorly understood. The glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) caused a presynaptic depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of guinea pig hippocampal slices. This depression was blocked by an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, which suggests that activation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor raises the concentration of extracellular adenosine, which acts on presynaptic inhibitory A1 receptors. Strong tetanic stimulation caused a heterosynaptic inhibition that was blocked by both NMDA and A1 receptor antagonists. Enkephalin, which selectively inhibits interneurons, antagonized the heterosynaptic inhibition. These findings suggest that synaptically released glutamate activates NMDA receptors, which in turn releases adenosine, at least in part from interneurons, that acts at a distance to inhibit presynaptically the release of glutamate from excitatory synapses. Thus, interneurons may mediate a widespread purinergic presynaptic inhibition.
Tyrosine-specific protein phosphorylation has been implicated in the regulation of cell transformation and proliferation. However, recent studies have shown that the expression of protein tyrosine kinases in adult brain is very high, suggesting that tyrosine-specific protein phosphorylation may also have a role in the regulation of neuronal function. Although a number of substrate proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, the functional alteration of proteins by tyrosine phosphorylation has previously been convincingly demonstrated only for protein tyrosine kinases. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel, is phosphorylated by a protein tyrosine kinase in post-synaptic membranes in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate here that this tyrosine phosphorylation increases the rate of the rapid phase of desensitization of the nicotinic receptor, as measured by single channel recording of purified nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, when reconstituted in lipid vesicles. These data provide direct evidence for the regulation of ion channel properties by tyrosine phosphorylation. The results, which demonstrate a functional role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the nervous system, suggest a widespread role for tyrosine phosphorylation in neuronal signal transduction.
Tolbutamide and other sulfonylureas inhibited spontaneous and nicotine-induced release of catecholamines from the perfused cat adrenal gland and nicotine-induced release of [3-H]norepinephrine from isolated guinea pig hearts. Of the sulfonylureas tested, the order to potency of this inhibitory effect paralled the hypoglycemic action. These results raise the possibility that the inhibition of the sympathoadrenal system may contribute in part to the hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas.
Studies of human auditory and somatosensory modalities have shown that there is an oscillatory response in the gamma-band (at about 40 Hz) frequency which is elicited by either steady state or transient stimulation. The auditory 40-Hz response is generated at least partially in the auditory cortex as a result of thalamocortical interaction and may serve perceptual integration and conscious perception. A connection to selective attention has been implied in human and animal studies, although the evidence is inconclusive. Moreover, fundamental differences between the human and animal 40-Hz responses prohibit generalization. Furthermore, most experiments have used steady-state stimulation during which the brain does not regain its resting state between stimuli as it does when transient stimulation is used. Here we study the effect of selective attention on the auditory gamma-band (40-Hz) transient response using subjects listening to tone pips presented in one ear while ignoring a concurrent sequence of tone pips in the other ear. The 40-Hz response was larger when subjects paid attention to stimuli rather than ignored them. This attention effect was most pronounced over the frontal and central scalp areas. Our results demonstrate a physiological correlate of selective attention in the 40-Hz transient response in humans.
The anatomy of 61 of the smallest interneurons in the brain of the locust shows the same tendency toward uniqueness, contancy of neuropil abortizations, and frequency of occurrence of supernumerary cells as does that of 17 large interneurons; the size and number of neurons thus have no obligatory relation to the concept of the unique identifiable neuron.
The motion aftereffect is a much studied and well documented phenomenon. After viewing a moving visual pattern for a period of time, the same pattern appears to drift in the opposite direction when it is stopped. Psychophysical experiments involving interocular transfer, dichoptic stimulation, and motion aftereffects contingent upon other visual parameters such as colour, orientation and texture, imply that the motion aftereffect is generated at the level of the visual cortex. It has been hypothesized that cortical neurons specialized for the detection of motion along a particular direction become 'fatigued' during the adaptation period so that the resting equilibrium subsequently shifts in the opposite direction to that of the adapting stimulus, giving rise to the sensation of the aftereffect. I have found that if observers are engaged in a separate discrimination task superimposed on a moving textured background, the subsequent motion aftereffect to the background is considerably reduced. It seems that motion aftereffects are susceptible to attentional mechanisms.
The representation of pain in the cerebral cortex is less well understood than that of any other sensory system. However, with the use of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in humans, it has now been demonstrated that painful heat causes significant activation of the contralateral anterior cingulate, secondary somatosensory, and primary somatosensory cortices. This contrasts with the predominant activation of primary somatosensory cortex caused by vibrotactile stimuli in similar experiments. Furthermore, the unilateral cingulate activation indicates that this forebrain area, thought to regulate emotions, contains an unexpectedly specific representation of pain.
Thalamic inputs strongly drive neurons in the primary visual cortex, even though these neurons constitute only approximately 5% of the synapses on layer 4 spiny stellate simple cells. We modeled the feedforward excitatory and inhibitory inputs to these cells based on in vivo recordings in cats, and we found that the reliability of spike transmission increased steeply between 20 and 40 synchronous thalamic inputs in a time window of 5 milliseconds, when the reliability per spike was most energetically efficient. The optimal range of synchronous inputs was influenced by the balance of background excitation and inhibition in the cortex, which could gate the flow of information into the cortex. Ensuring reliable transmission by spike synchrony in small populations of neurons may be a general principle of cortical function.
Alternative splicing of eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors represents a common mechanism for generating multiple transcripts from a single gene. Although there has been increasing information concerning the sequence requirements and the biochemical mechanisms involved in the constitutive splicing of primary RNA transcripts, very little is known about the sequences or mechanisms which determine alternative RNA-processing events in complex transcription units. The calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) primary RNA transcript undergoes tissue-specific alternative processing, resulting in the differential production of calcitonin mRNA in thyroid C cells and CGRP mRNA in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these alternative RNA processing events, we have examined the nucleotide sequences involved in the production of calcitonin and CGRP mRNAs. Analyses of HeLa and F9 cell lines transfected with a variety of mutant calcitonin/CGRP transcription units have demonstrated that alternative splice-site selection is primarily regulated by cis-active element(s) near the calcitonin-specific 3'-splice junction. We suggest that the tissue-specific pattern of alternative RNA processing is conferred by sequence information at the calcitonin-specific acceptor which serves to inhibit the production of calcitonin transcripts in CGRP-producing cells.
Glucose uptake into pancreatic beta cells by means of the glucose transporter GLUT-2, which has a high Michaelis constant, is essential for the normal insulin secretory response to hyperglycemia. In both autoimmune and nonautoimmune diabetes, this glucose transport is reduced as a consequence of down-regulation of the normal beta-cell transporter. In autoimmune diabetes, circulating immunoglobulins can further impair this glucose transport by inhibiting functionally intact transporters. Insights into mechanisms of the unresponsiveness of beta cells to hyperglycemia may improve the management and prevention of diabetes.
Intracellular deposition of aggregated and ubiquitylated proteins is a prominent cytopathological feature of most neurodegenerative disorders. Whether protein aggregates themselves are pathogenic or are the consequence of an underlying molecular lesion is unclear. Here, we report that protein aggregation directly impaired the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Transient expression of two unrelated aggregation-prone proteins, a huntingtin fragment containing a pathogenic polyglutamine repeat and a folding mutant of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, caused nearly complete inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Because of the central role of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in regulating fundamental cellular events such as cell division and apoptosis, our data suggest a potential mechanism linking protein aggregation to cellular disregulation and cell death.
A flood of new information from projects such as the sequencing of the genome of the mustard plant Arabidopsis has pinpointed genes involved in key processes such as speeding up flowering, changing a plant's basic architecture, or improving pest resistance. One example appears on page 344 of this issue; researchers report the cloning of an Arabidopsis gene called FRIGIDA and show that natural mutations leading to loss of FRIGIDA function are associated with early flowering, a helpful adaptation in some cold climates. Such work could allow researchers to enhance the traits they want by introducing one or a few genes from another plant, or by modifying the regulation of genes in their original settings.
The concentration in plasma of the female protein (FP) of the golden Syrian hamster is regulated by sex steroids and by mediators of the acute-phase response to tissue injury or inflammation. A complementary DNA (cDNA) clone corresponding to FP was isolated from a hamster liver cDNA library and used to determine the nucleotide sequence and derived amino acid sequence of native FP. The primary sequence of FP is 69 percent identical to human serum amyloid P component and 50 percent identical to human C-reactive protein. Evidence showed that sex-limited and acute-phase control of the FP gene is pretranslational. The FP protein is thus a useful model for investigating dual regulation of expression of a single gene.
Treatment of chick embryos in ovo with crude and partially purified extracts from embryonic hindlimbs (days 8 to 9) during the normal cell death period (days 5 to 10) rescues a significant number of motoneurons from degeneration. The survival activity of partially purified extract was dose-dependent and developmentally regulated. The survival of sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic, and a population of cholinergic sympathetic preganglionic neurons was unaffected by treatment with hindlimb extract. The massive motoneuron death that occurs after early target (hindlimb) removal was partially ameliorated by daily treatment with the hindlimb extract. These results indicate that a target-derived neurotrophic factor is involved in the regulation of motoneuron survival in vivo.
A variety of neurotransmitters, hormones, and other regulatory agents affect the phosphorylation of specific proteins in their target tissues. The types of stimuli that share this common effect on protein phosphorylation include numerous substances that do not act through cyclic AMP. These and other observations suggest that many different classes of regulatory substances achieve certain of their biological effects by altering the phosphorylation of specific proteins.
Reward is important for shaping goal-directed behaviour. After stimulus-reward associative learning, an organism can assess the motivational value of the incoming stimuli on the basis of past experience (retrospective processing), and predict forthcoming rewarding events (prospective processing). The traditional role of the sensory thalamus is to relay current sensory information to cortex. Here we find that non-primary thalamic neurons respond to reward-related events in two ways. The early, phasic responses occurred shortly after the onset of the stimuli and depended on the sensory modality. Their magnitudes resisted extinction and correlated with the learning experience. The late responses gradually increased during the cue and delay periods, and peaked just before delivery of the reward. These responses were independent of sensory modality and were modulated by the value and timing of the reward. These observations provide new evidence that single thalamic neurons can code for the acquired significance of sensory stimuli in the early responses (retrospective coding) and predict upcoming reward value in the late responses (prospective coding).
Recent studies have demonstrated that monkeys and humans can use signals from the brain to guide computer cursors. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) may one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using BCIs is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether BCIs use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance BCI than previously reported. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or approximately 15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of BCIs in humans.
As we move through our environment, the flow of the deforming images on our retinae provides rich information about ego motion and about the three-dimensional structure of the external world. Flow-fields comprise five independent components, including radial and circular motion. Here we provide psychophysical evidence for the existence of neural mechanisms in human vision that integrate motion signals along these complex trajectories. Signal-to-noise sensitivity for discriminating the direction of radial, circular and translational motion increased predictably with the number of exposed sectors, implying the existence of specialized detectors that integrate motion signals of different directions from different locations. However, contrast sensitivity for complex motion did not increase greatly with sector number, implying that the specialized detectors are preceded by a first stage of local-motion mechanisms that impose a contrast threshold. These findings fit well with recent electrophysiological evidence in monkey showing that whereas motion-sensitive neurons in primary visual cortex respond best to local translation, many neurons in the medial superior temporal cortex have large receptive fields tuned to radial, circular or spiral motion.
Long-term potentiation (LTP), the increase in synaptic strength evoked by high-frequency stimulation, is often considered to be a cellular model for learning and memory. The validity of this model depends on the assumptions that physiological stimuli can induce LTP in vivo and that the resulting synaptic modifications correlate with behavioural changes. However, modifiable synapses are generally embedded deep in complex circuits. In contrast, the goldfish Mauthner (M)-cell and its afferent synapses are easily accessible for electrophysiological studies, and firing of this neuron is sufficient to trigger fast escape behaviour in response to sudden stimuli. We have previously shown that tetanic stimulation can induce LTP of the feedforward inhibitory synapses that control the excitability of the M-cell. Here we report that natural sensory stimulation can induce potentiation of this inhibitory connection that resembles the LTP induced by afferent tetanization. Furthermore, comparable acoustic stimulation produced a parallel decrease in the probability of the sound-evoked escape reflex. Thus we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, a behavioural role for the long-term synaptic strengthening of inhibitory synapses.
A common feature of general anaesthetic agents is their ability to potentiate neuronal inhibition through GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors. At concentrations relevant to clinical anaesthesia, these agents cause a dramatic stimulation of the chloride currents that are evoked by the binding of the natural ligand, GABA. Although there is widespread evidence that the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to anaesthetic agents is heterogeneous, the structural basis of these differences is largely unknown. Variations in subunit composition can have profound effects on the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to modulatory agents such as benzodiazepines. However, strict subunit specificity has not been demonstrated for the potentiating effects of anaesthetic agents. Here we describe a new class of human GABA(A) receptor subunit (epsilon) that can assemble with alpha- and beta-subunits and confer an insensitivity to the potentiating effects of intravenous anaesthetic agents. The epsilon-subunit also abolishes the normal outward rectification of recombinant receptors in which it assembles. The expression pattern of this subunit in the brain suggests a new target for manipulation of neuronal pathways within the basal ganglia.
Circadian clocks drive rhythmic behaviour in animals and are regulated by transcriptional feedback loops. For example, the Drosophila proteins Clock (Clk) and Cycle (Cyc) activate transcription of period (per) and timeless (tim). Per and Tim then associate, translocate to the nucleus, and repress the activity of Clk and Cyc. However, post-translational modifications are also critical to proper timing. Per and Tim undergo rhythmic changes in phosphorylation, and evidence supports roles for two kinases in this process: Doubletime (Dbt) phosphorylates Per, whereas Shaggy (Sgg) phosphorylates Tim. Yet Sgg and Dbt often require a phosphoserine in their target site, and analysis of Per phosphorylation in dbt mutants suggests a role for other kinases. Here we show that the catalytic subunit of Drosophila casein kinase 2 (CK2alpha) is expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm of key circadian pacemaker neurons. CK2alpha mutant flies show lengthened circadian period, decreased CK2 activity, and delayed nuclear entry of Per. These effects are probably direct, as CK2alpha specifically phosphorylates Per in vitro. We propose that CK2 is an evolutionary link between the divergent circadian systems of animals, plants and fungi.
Controversy exists over whether aluminium has a role in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is neuropathologically characterized by the occurrence of a minimum density of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in the hippocampus and the association cortex of the brain. The purported association of aluminium with Alzheimer's disease is based on: (1) the experimental induction of fibrillary changes in the neurons of animals by the injection of aluminium salts into brain tissue; (2) reported detection of aluminium in neuritic plaques and tangle-bearing neurons; (3) epidemiological studies linking aluminium levels in the environment, notably water supplies, with an increased prevalence of dementia; and (4) a reported decrease in the rate of disease progression following the administration of desferroxamine, an aluminium chelator, to clinically diagnosed sufferers of Alzheimer's disease. Here we use nuclear microscopy, a new analytical technique involving million-volt nuclear particles, to identify and analyse plaques in postmortem tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease without using chemical staining techniques and fail to demonstrate the presence of aluminium in plaque cores in untreated tissue.
Very little is known about the receptors and target molecules involved in natural killer (NK) cell activity. Here we present a model system in which interleukin-2-activated killing by NK cells depends on the intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-2 and is regulated by the distribution of ICAM-2. The level of ICAM-2 expression in NK-sensitive and resistant cells is similar, but in sensitive cells ICAM-2 is concentrated into bud-like cellular projections known as uropods, whereas in resistant cells it is evenly distributed. The cytoskeletal-membrane linker protein ezrin is also localized in uropods. Transfection of human ezrin into NK-resistant cells induces uropods formation, redistribution of ICAM-2 and ezrin, and sensitizes target cells to interleukin-2-activated killing. These results reveal a new mechanism of target-cell recognition: cytotoxic cells recognize adhesion molecules that are already present on normal cells, but in diseased cells are concentrated into a biologically active cell-surface region by cytoskeletal reorganization. The results also highlight the importance of cytoskeletal interactions in the regulation of ICAM-2-mediated adhesive phenomena.
The horizontal separation of the eyes means that objects nearer or farther than the fixation point project to different locations on the two retinae, differing principally in their horizontal coordinates (horizontal binocular disparity). Disparity-selective neurons have generally been studied with disparities applied in only one direction (often horizontal), which cannot determine whether the encoding is specialized for processing disparities along the horizontal axis. It is therefore unclear if disparity selectivity represents a specialization for naturally occurring disparities. I used random dot stereograms to study disparity-selective neurons from the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake fixating monkeys. Many combinations of vertical and horizontal disparity were used, characterizing the surface of responses as a function of two-dimensional disparity. Here I report that the response surface usually showed elongation along the horizontal disparity axis, despite the isotropic stimulus. Thus these neurons modulated their firing rate over a wider range of horizontal disparity than vertical disparity. This demonstrates that disparity-selective cells are specialized for processing horizontal disparity, and that existing models of disparity selectivity require substantial revision.
Calcium ions entering cells through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels initiate rapid release of neurotransmitters and secretion of hormones. Ca2+ currents can be inhibited in many cell types by neurotransmitters acting through G proteins via a membrane-delimited pathway independently of soluble intracellular messengers. Inhibition is typically caused by a positive shift in the voltage dependence and a slowing of channel activation and is relieved by strong depolarization resulting in facilitation of Ca2+ currents. This pathway regulates the activity of N-type and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, which are localized in presynaptic terminals and participate in neurotransmitter release. Synaptic transmission is inhibited by neurotransmitters through this mechanism. G-protein alpha subunits confer specificity in receptor coupling, but it is not known whether the G alpha or G beta gamma subunits are responsible for modulation of Ca2+ channels. Here we report that G beta gamma subunits can modulate Ca2+ channels. Transfection of G beta gamma into cells expressing P/Q-type Ca2+ channels induces modulation like that caused by activation of G protein-coupled receptors, but G alpha subunits do not. Similarly, injection or expression of G beta gamma subunits in sympathetic ganglion neurons induces facilitation and occludes modulation of N-type channels by noradrenaline, but G alpha subunits do not. In both cases, the G gamma subunit is ineffective by itself, but overexpression of exogenous G beta subunits is sufficient to cause channel modulation.
Focal electroencephalographic discharges in lesions of cortex induced by freezing are associated with prolonged membrane depolarizations and hyperpolarizations in neurons located at various depths in the lesion sites. Transmembrane potential changes have properties similar to those of postsynaptic potentials. The temporal relationship between intracellular potentials and paroxysmal discharges indicates that the latter are extracellularly recorded summations of synchronously developing depolarizations and hyperpolarizations in complex synaptic organizations of neurons.
Human colour vision depends on three classes of cone photoreceptors, those sensitive to short (S), medium (M) or long (L) wavelengths, and on how signals from these cones are combined by neurons in the retina and brain. Macaque monkey colour vision is similar to human, and the receptive fields of macaque visual neurons have been used as an animal model of human colour processing. P retinal ganglion cells and parvocellular neurons are colour-selective neurons in macaque retina and lateral geniculate nucleus. Interactions between cone signals feeding into these neurons are still unclear. On the basis of experimental results with chromatic adaptation, excitatory and inhibitory inputs from L and M cones onto P cells (and parvocellular neurons) were thought to be quite specific (Fig. 1a). But these experiments with spatially diffuse adaptation did not rule out the 'mixed-surround' hypothesis: that there might be one cone-specific mechanism, the receptive field centre, and a surround mechanism connected to all cone types indiscriminately (Fig. 1e). Recent work has tended to support the mixed-surround hypothesis. We report here the development of new stimuli to measure spatial maps of the linear L-, M- and S-cone inputs to test the hypothesis definitively. Our measurements contradict the mixed-surround hypothesis and imply cone specificity in both centre and surround.
Normally growing cells promptly cease DNA synthesis when exposed to genotoxic stresses, such as radiation, and this cell-cycle arrest prevents the accumulation of mutations. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 is essential for the regulation of the interferon system, inhibits cell growth, and manifests tumour-suppressor activities. Here we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) lacking IRF-1 are deficient in their ability to undergo DNA-damage-induced cell-cycle arrest. A similar phenotype has been observed in EFs lacking the tumour suppressor p53 (refs 8, 9), although the expression of IRF-1 and p53 are independent of one another. Furthermore, we show that transcriptional induction of the gene encoding p21 (WAF1, CIP1), a cell-cycle inhibitor, by gamma-irradiation is dependent on both p53 and IRF-1, and that the p21 promoter is activated, either directly or indirectly, by both in a transient cotransfection assay. These two tumour-suppressor transcription factors therefore converge functionally to regulate the cell cycle through the activation of a common target gene.
Rapid information transfer within the brain depends on chemical signalling between neurons that is mediated primarily by glutamate and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), acting at ionotropic receptors to cause excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs or IPSPs), respectively. In addition, synaptically released glutamate acts on metabotropic receptors to excite neurons on a slower timescale through second-messenger cascades, including phosphoinositide hydrolysisl. We now report a unique IPSP mediated by the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. In ventral midbrain dopamine neurons, activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1) mobilized calcium from caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive stores and increased an apamin-sensitive potassium conductance. The underlying potassium conductance and dependence on calcium stores set this IPSP apart from the slow IPSPs described so far. The mGluR-induced hyperpolarization was dependent on brief exposure to agonist, because prolonged application of exogenous agonist desensitized the hyperpolarization and caused the more commonly reported depolarization. The rapid rise and brief duration of synaptically released glutamate in the extracellular space can therefore mediate a rapid excitation through activation of ionotropic receptors, followed by inhibition through the mGluR1 receptor. Thus the idea that glutamate is solely an excitatory neurotransmitter must be replaced with a more complex view of its dual function in synaptic transmission.
Sustained exposure to glucocorticoids, the adrenocortical stress hormones, is toxic to neurons, and such toxicity appears to play a role in neuron loss during aging. Previous work has shown that glucocorticoids compromise the capacity of neurons to survive a variety of metabolic insults. This report extends those observations by showing that ischemic injury to neurons in rat brain is also potentiated by exposure to high physiological titers of glucocorticoids and is attenuated by adrenalectomy. The synergy between ischemic and glucocorticoid brain injury was seen even when glucocorticoid levels were manipulated after the ischemic insult. Pharmacological interventions that diminish the adrenocortical stress response may improve neurological outcome from stroke or cardiac arrest.
Most of our long-term memories of episodes or objects are organized so that we can retrieve them by association. Clinical neuropsychologists assess human memory by the paired-associate learning test, in which a series of paired words or figures is presented and the subject is then asked to retrieve the other pair member associated with each cue. Patients with lesions of the temporal lobe show marked impairment in this test. In our study, we trained monkeys in a pair-association task using a set of computer-generated paired patterns. We found two types of task-related neurons in the anterior temporal cortex. One type selectively responded to both pictures of the paired associates. The other type, which had the strongest response to one picture during the cue presentation, exhibited increasing activity during the delay period when the associate of that picture was used as a cue. These results provide new evidence that single neurons acquire selectivity for visual patterns through associative learning. They also indicate neural mechanisms for storage and retrieval in the long-term memory of paired associates.
A theory of emotional expression, ignored since 1906, holds that facial muscles act as ligatures on facial blood vessels and thereby regulate cerebral blood flow, which, in turn, influences subjective feeling. The theory, developed by Israel Waynbaum, a French physician, hypothesizes the subjective experience of emotions as following facial expression rather than preceding it. It answers Darwin's question of why different muscles contract or relax in different emotions better than Darwin's own theory. When restated in terms of contemporary neurophysiological knowledge, it explains and organizes several ill-understood emotional processes and phenomena.
Autoradiography combined with image analysis permitted quantitative visualization of dopamine (D2) and serotonin (S2) binding sites in rat brain. Forebrain sections were incubated with tritiated spiroperidol alone or with tritiated spiroperidol plus unlabeled compounds that saturated the D2 or S2 sites. By subtracting the digitized image of an autoradiograph derived from the latter sections from that of the former, the D2 or S2 sites were specifically revealed. The resulting quantitative images demonstrate the differing anatomical distributions of these sites. The D2 site is largely restricted to the striatal complex (caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens septi, and olfactory tubercle), whereas the S2 site is enriched in layer 5 of motor cortex, the perirhinal and cingulate cortices, and the claustrum.
The hypothesis that the action of hallucinogenic drugs is mediated by a depression of the activity of brain serotonergic (raphe) neurons was tested by examining the behavioral effects of d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) while studying the activity of raphe neurons in freely moving cats. Although the results provide general support for the hypothesis, there were several important dissociations. (i) Low doses of LSD produced only small decreases in raphe unit activity but significant behavoiral changes; (ii) LSD-induced behavioral changes outlasted the depression of raphe unit activity; and (iii) raphe neurons were at least as responsive to LSD during tolerance as they were in the nontolerant condition.
The toc1 mutation causes shortened circadian rhythms in light-grown Arabidopsis plants. Here, we report the same toc1 effect in the absence of light input to the clock. We also show that TOC1 controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function. The TOC1 gene was isolated and found to encode a nuclear protein containing an atypical response regulator receiver domain and two motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation: a basic motif conserved within the CONSTANS family of transcription factors and an acidic domain. TOC1 is itself circadianly regulated and participates in a feedback loop to control its own expression.
Selective antagonism of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) and noradrenaline transport by antidepressants is a key element in the 'amine' hypothesis of affective disorders. Uptake and/or transport sites of 5HT have been reported to be reduced in platelets of patients suffering from depression and in post-mortem brain samples of depressed patients and suicide victims. To date there has been little molecular information available on the structure and regulation of 5HT transporters. Using the polymerase chain reaction with degenerate oligonucleotides derived from two highly conserved regions of the transporters for noradrenaline and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), we have identified a large family of related gene products expressed in rodent brain. One of these products hybridizes to a single 3.7-kilobase RNA restricted to rat midbrain and brainstem, where it is highly enriched within the serotonergic raphe complex. Transfection with a single 2.3-kilobase brainstem complementary DNA clone is sufficient to confer expression of a Na(+)-dependent 5HT transporter upon nonneural cells, with transport selectively and potently antagonized by 5HT uptake-specific antidepressants, including paroxetine, citalopram and fluoxetine.
The observation of the regulation of fast protein dynamics in a cellular context requires the development of reliable technologies. Here, a signal regulation cascade reliant on the stimulus-dependent acceleration of the bidirectional flow of mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) across the nuclear envelope was visualized by reversible protein highlighting. Light-induced conversion between the bright and dark states of a monomeric fluorescent protein engineered from a novel coral protein was employed. Because of its photochromic properties, the protein could be highlighted, erased, and highlighted again in a nondestructive manner, allowing direct observation of regulated fast nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of key signaling molecules.
After chromosome replication, sister chromatid copies are generally thought to segregate randomly to daughter cells. However, sister chromatids differ in their DNA strands, with each chromatid inheriting one older strand that is paired to a newly synthesized strand. Genetic analysis with a homologous chromosome pair indicated nonrandom chromatid distribution in embryonic stem cells. Biased segregation pattern was also found in all 100 endoderm cells examined, but not in any of the 165 neuroectoderm cells. In contrast, the mesoderm, cardiomyocyte, and pancreatic cells exhibited a random mode of segregation. Strand distribution mechanisms regulated by cell type may have consequences for cellular differentiation and for evolving strategies for developmental mechanisms.
Peptide hormones, neurotransmitters, and autacoids activate a family of seven-transmembrane-domain receptors. Each of these receptors specifically couples to one of several G proteins, Gs, Gi, G(o) and Gp, to activate a specific second messenger system. Cell surface receptors for prostanoids have been characterized pharmacologically and the complementary DNAs for thromboxane A2 receptor and the EP3 subtype of the prostaglandin (PG)E receptor reveal that they belong to the seven-transmembrane-domain receptor family. The EP3 receptor mediates the diverse physiological actions of PGE2 (ref. 3). Although most of them occur through coupling of the EP3 receptor to Gi and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, the EP3-mediated contraction of uterine muscle can only occur by activation of another second messenger pathway. In chromaffin cells, two different second messenger pathways are activated by PGE2 binding to an apparently single EP3 receptor class. Here we show that at least four isoforms of the EP3 receptor, which differ only at their C-terminal tails and are produced by alternative splicing, couple to different G proteins to activate different second messenger systems.
Our inferences about brain mechanisms underlying perception rely on whether it is possible for the brain to 'reconstruct' a stimulus from the information contained in the spike trains from many neurons. How the brain actually accomplishes this reconstruction remains largely unknown. Oscillatory and synchronized activities in the brain of mammals have been correlated with distinct behavioural states or the execution of complex cognitive tasks and are proposed to participate in the 'binding' of individual features into more complex percepts. But if synchronization is indeed relevant, what senses it? In insects, oscillatory synchronized activity in the early olfactory system seems to be necessary for fine odour discrimination and enables the encoding of information about a stimulus in spike times relative to the oscillatory 'clock. Here we study the decoding of these coherent oscillatory signals. We identify a population of neurons downstream from the odour-activated, synchronized neuronal assemblies. These downstream neurons show odour responses whose specificity is degraded when their inputs are desynchronized. This degradation of selectivity consists of the appearance of responses to new odours and a loss of discrimination of spike trains evoked by different odours. Such loss of information is never observed in the upstream neurons whose activity is desynchronized. These results indicate that information encoded in time across ensembles of neurons converges onto single neurons downstream in the pathway.
An essential function of the brain is to detect threats, such as those posed by objects or predators on a collision course. A wide-field, movement-sensitive visual neuron in the brain of the locust was studied by presenting simulated approaching, receding, and translating objects. The neuron's responses could be described simply by multiplying the velocity of the image edge (dtheta/dtau) with an exponential function of the size of the object's image on the retina (e-alpha theta). Because this product peaks before the image reaches its maximum size during approach, this neuron can anticipate collision. The neuron's activity peaks approximately when the approaching object reaches a certain angular size. Because this neuron receives distinct inputs about image size and velocity, the dendritic tree of a single neuron may function as a biophysical device that can carry out a multiplication of two independent input signals.
Glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a recently cloned new member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, promotes survival of cultured fetal mesencephalic dopamine neurons and is expressed in the developing striatum. There have, however, been no reports about effects of GDNF in situ. We have used the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which produces parkinsonian symptoms in man, to determine whether GDNF might exert protective or regenerative effects in vivo in the adult nigrostriatal dopamine system in C57/B1 mice. GDNF injected over the substantia nigra or in striatum before MPTP potently protects the dopamine system, as shown by numbers of mesencephalic dopamine nerve cell bodies, dopamine nerve terminal densities and dopamine levels. When GDNF is given after MPTP, dopamine levels and fibre densities are significantly restored. In both cases, motor behaviour is increased above normal levels. We conclude that intracerebral GDNF administration exerts both protective and reparative effects on the nigrostriatal dopamine system, which may have implications for the development of new treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease.
A goal in visual neuroscience is to reveal how the visual system reconstructs the three-dimensional (3D) representation of the world from two-dimensional retinal images. Although the importance of texture gradient cues in the process of 3D vision has been pointed out, most studies concentrate on the neural process based on binocular disparity. We report the neural correlates of depth perception from texture gradient in the cortex. In the caudal part of the lateral bank of intraparietal sulcus, many neurons were selective to 3D surface orientation defined by texture gradient, and their response was invariant over different types of texture pattern. Most of these neurons were also sensitive to a disparity gradient, suggesting that they integrate texture and disparity gradient signals to construct a generalized representation of 3D surface orientation.
Potassium channels in neurons are linked by guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins to numerous neurotransmitter receptors. The ability of Go, the predominant G protein in the brain, to stimulate potassium channels was tested in cell-free membrane patches of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Four distinct types of potassium channels, which were otherwise quiescent, were activated by both isolated brain G0 and recombinant Go alpha. Hence brain Go can couple diverse brain potassium channels to neurotransmitter receptors.
Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to renew themselves and to give rise to all lineages of the blood; however, the signals that regulate HSC self-renewal remain unclear. Here we show that the Wnt signalling pathway has an important role in this process. Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in their normal microenvironment activate a LEF-1/TCF reporter, which indicates that HCSs respond to Wnt signalling in vivo. To demonstrate the physiological significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation we show that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the Wnt signalling pathway, leads to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of Wnt signalling in HSCs induces increased expression of HoxB4 and Notch1, genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. We conclude that the Wnt signalling pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis in vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential molecular hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.
The Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase (AceK) is a unique bifunctional enzyme that phosphorylates or dephosphorylates isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) in response to environmental changes, resulting in the inactivation or, respectively, activation of ICDH. ICDH inactivation short-circuits the Krebs cycle by enabling the glyoxlate bypass. It was the discovery of AceK and ICDH that established the existence of protein phosphorylation regulation in prokaryotes. As a 65-kDa protein, AceK is significantly larger than typical eukaryotic protein kinases. Apart from the ATP-binding motif, AceK does not share sequence homology with any eukaryotic protein kinase or phosphatase. Most intriguingly, AceK possesses the two opposing activities of protein kinase and phosphatase within one protein, and specifically recognizes only intact ICDH. Additionally, AceK has strong ATPase activity. It has been shown that AceK kinase, phosphatase and ATPase activities reside at the same site, although the molecular basis of such multifunctionality and its regulation remains completely unknown. Here we report the structures of AceK and its complex with ICDH. The AceK structure reveals a eukaryotic protein-kinase-like domain containing ATP and a regulatory domain with a novel fold. As an AceK phosphatase activator and kinase inhibitor, AMP is found to bind in an allosteric site between the two AceK domains. An AMP-mediated conformational change exposes and shields ATP, acting as a switch between AceK kinase and phosphatase activities, and ICDH-binding induces further conformational change for AceK activation. The substrate recognition loop of AceK binds to the ICDH dimer, allowing higher-order substrate recognition and interaction, and inducing critical conformational change at the phosphorylation site of ICDH.
Penicillin enhances the excitatory postsynaptic potential of the squid stellate ganglion. This effect suggests the hypothesis that the epileptic focus created by the topical application of penicillin to the mammalian cerebral cortex is produced by the facilitation of excitatory synaptic coupling within the preexisting positive recurrent feedback system.
Long-term modification of transmission efficacy at synapses is the cellular basis of memory and learning. A special type of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum was postulated theoretically, and has since been verified. Each cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) receives two distinct excitatory inputs, one from parallel fibres (PFs) and the other from a climbing fibre (CF). When these two types of inputs are conjunctively activated, PF-PC transmission undergoes long-term depression (LTD). Accumulated evidence suggests that LTD plays a role in the motor learning processes of the cerebellum. At the molecular level, LTD appears to be caused by desensitization of receptor molecules in PC dendrites towards the PF neurotransmitter, presumably L-glutamate (Glu). Glu receptors are heterogeneous and can be divided into several subtypes. In this study, we compared the potency of several Glu agonists in inducing LTD and found a highly selective dependency of LTD on the quisqualate(QA)-selective subtype of Glu receptors.
The mammalian forebrain, including the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) and the visual cortex, continues both structural and functional development postnatally and is therefore a useful model for the study of developmental processes in the central nervous system (CNS). We report here the first description and comparison of the structural development of individual, functionally identified neurones in the mammalian forebrain. This comparison is made for the three main cell groups of the central visual pathways (W-, X- and Y-cells), in the neonate and the adult. In the adult, these three classes of neurones have different characteristic electrophysiological properties(1-9) and relay information in parallel about different features of a visual scene8,9 from the retina through the LGNd to the visual cortex. In addition, each of the three functional cell types has a characteristic structure in the adult10,11. By injection of the enzyme marker substance, horseradish peroxidase, into electrophysiologically identified neurones, the present study demonstrates that each of these functional classes of neurones also has a characteristic morphology in the neonate (in the LGNd of kitten 3-4 postnatal weeks of age). However, striking differences in the rates of maturation are seen. The W-cells are already mature at this age. The X-cells are the least developed. Surprisingly, some Y-cells are mature. Due to the susceptibility of Y-cells to an abnormal visual environment during development12-18, they had previously been thought to be slower to mature.
Cellular growth and proliferation are coordinated during organogenesis. Misregulation of these processes leads to pathological conditions such as cancer. Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a benign tumour syndrome caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor genes. Studies in Drosophila and other organisms have identified TSC signalling as a conserved pathway for growth control. Activation of the TSC pathway is mediated by Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain), a Ras superfamily GTPase. Rheb is a direct target of TSC2 and is negatively regulated by its GTPase-activating protein activity. However, molecules required for positive regulation of Rheb have not been identified. Here we show that a conserved protein, translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP), is an essential new component of the TSC-Rheb pathway. Reducing Drosophila TCTP (dTCTP) levels reduces cell size, cell number and organ size, which mimics Drosophila Rheb (dRheb) mutant phenotypes. dTCTP is genetically epistatic to Tsc1 and dRheb, but acts upstream of dS6k, a downstream target of dRheb. dTCTP directly associates with dRheb and displays guanine nucleotide exchange activity with it in vivo and in vitro. Human TCTP (hTCTP) shows similar biochemical properties compared to dTCTP and can rescue dTCTP mutant phenotypes, suggesting that the function of TCTP in the TSC pathway is evolutionarily conserved. Our studies identify TCTP as a direct regulator of Rheb and a potential therapeutic target for TSC disease.
The adenovirus oncoprotein E1A and the simian virus SV40 large T antigen can both reverse the strong growth-inhibitory effect of transforming growth factor(TGF)-beta on mink lung epithelial cells: exposure of TGF-beta causes these cells to arrest late in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (ref. 3). This arrest correlates with an increase in expression of the protein p15Ink4B (ref. 4), inactivation of the cyclin E/A-cdk2 complex by the inhibitory protein p27Kip1 (refs 5-7), and with the accumulation of unphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. The rescue by E1A of cells from TGF-beta arrest is partly independent of its binding to retinoblastoma protein. Here we show that E1A directly affects the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 in TGF-beta-treated cells by binding to it and blocking its inhibitory effect, thereby restoring the activity of the cyclin-cdk2 kinase complex. In this way, E1A can overcome the effect of TGF-beta and modulate the cell cycle. To our knowledge, E1A provides the first example of a viral oncoprotein that can disable a cellular protein whose function is to inhibit the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases.
Atherosclerosis is characterized by the thickening of the arterial wall and is the primary cause of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease, two of the most common causes of illness and death worldwide. Clinical trials have confirmed that certain lipoproteins and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and that interventions targeted towards these are beneficial. Furthermore, efforts to understand how risk factors such as high blood pressure, dysregulated blood lipids and diabetes contribute to atherosclerotic disease, as well as to understand the molecular pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaques, are leading to new targets for therapy.
The ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction module that controls cellular growth, differentiation and survival. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by the binding of growth factors initiates GTP loading of RAS, which triggers the initial steps in the activation of the ERK pathway by modulating RAF family kinase function. Once activated, RAF participates in a sequential cascade of phosphorylation events that activate MEK, and in turn ERK. Unbridled signalling through the ERK pathway caused by activating mutations in RTKs, RAS or RAF has been linked to several human cancers. Of note, one member of the RAF family, BRAF, is the most frequently mutated oncogene in the kinase superfamily. Not surprisingly, there has been a colossal effort to understand the underlying regulation of this family of kinases. In particular, the process by which the RAF kinase domain becomes activated towards its substrate MEK remains of topical interest. Here, using Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, we demonstrate that RAF catalytic function is regulated in response to a specific mode of dimerization of its kinase domain, which we term the side-to-side dimer. Moreover, we find that the RAF-related pseudo-kinase KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras) also participates in forming side-to-side heterodimers with RAF and can thereby trigger RAF activation. This mechanism provides an elegant explanation for the longstanding conundrum about RAF catalytic activation, and also provides an explanation for the capacity of KSR, despite lacking catalytic function, to directly mediate RAF activation. We also show that RAF side-to-side dimer formation is essential for aberrant signalling by oncogenic BRAF mutants, and identify an oncogenic mutation that acts specifically by promoting side-to-side dimerization. Together, our data identify the side-to-side dimer interface of RAF as a potential therapeutic target for intervention in BRAF-dependent tumorigenesis.
Mice with the mutant gene tottering (tg, chromosome 8, autosomal recessive) show, in adolescence, abnormal bursts of bilaterally synchronous spike waves as revealed in electrocorticograms recorded over long periods. The spike waves are accompanied by behavioral "absence" attacks and intermittent focal motor seizures showing somatotopic progression. Cerebral metabolic activity during seizures was assayed by autoradiography of brain sections from mice injected intravenously with 14C-labeled 2-deoxyglucose. Metabolic activity was increased bilaterally in selected brainstem structures. Spontaneous electrocorticographic and clinical seizures of this general pattern were recognized hitherto only in humans.
Locomotion and reaching have traditionally been regarded as separate motor activities. In fact, they may be closely connected both from an evolutionary and a neurophysiological viewpoint. Reaching seems to have evolved from the neural systems responsible for the active and precise positioning of the limb during locomotion; moreover, it seems to be organized in the spinal cord. The motor cortex and its corticospinal outflow are preferentially engaged when precise positioning of the limb is needed during locomotion and are also involved during reaching and active positioning of the hand near objects of interest. All of these motor activities require visuomotor coordination, and it is this coordination that could be achieved by the motor cortex and interconnected parietal and cerebellar areas.
Neurones in the visual cortex are highly selective for orientation and spatial frequency of visual stimuli. There is strong neurophysiological evidence that orientation selectivity is enhanced by inhibitory interconnections between columns in the cortex which have different orientation sensitivities, an idea which is supported by experiments using neuropharmacological manipulation or complex visual stimuli. It has also been proposed that selectivity for spatial frequency is mediated in part by a similar mechanism to that for orientation, although evidence for this is based on special use of visual stimuli, which hampers interpretation of the findings. We have therefore examined selectivity for both orientation and spatial frequency using a technique which allows direct inferences about inhibitory processes. Our method uses microiontophoresis of an excitatory amino acid to elevate maintained discharge of single neurones in the visual cortex. We then present visual stimuli both within and outside the range of orientations and spatial frequencies which cause a cell to respond with increased discharge. Our results show that orientations presented on either side of the responsive range usually produce clear suppression of maintained discharge. In marked contrast, spatial frequencies shown to either side of the responsive range have little or no effect on maintained activity. We conclude that there is an intracortical organization of inhibitory connections between cells tuned to different orientations but not different spatial frequencies.
Post-translational modifications provide sensitive and flexible mechanisms to dynamically modulate protein function in response to specific signalling inputs. In the case of transcription factors, changes in phosphorylation state can influence protein stability, conformation, subcellular localization, cofactor interactions, transactivation potential and transcriptional output. Here we show that the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor Eyes absent (Eya) belongs to the phosphatase subgroup of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, and propose a function for it as a non-thiol-based protein tyrosine phosphatase. Experiments performed in cultured Drosophila cells and in vitro indicate that Eyes absent has intrinsic protein tyrosine phosphatase activity and can autocatalytically dephosphorylate itself. Confirming the biological significance of this function, mutations that disrupt the phosphatase active site severely compromise the ability of Eyes absent to promote eye specification and development in Drosophila. Given the functional importance of phosphorylation-dependent modulation of transcription factor activity, this evidence for a nuclear transcriptional coactivator with intrinsic phosphatase activity suggests an unanticipated method of fine-tuning transcriptional regulation.
The effect of serum on the rate of substrate oxidation by dissociated brain cells in vitro was examined. At a serum protein concentration of approximately 0.55 milligram per milliliter, oxidation of [6-14C]glucose to 14CO2 was decreased more than 50 percent. Oxidation of [3-14C]-3-hydroxybutyrate and [U-14C]glutamine was decreased much less. Serum from cows, rats, horses, and humans produced similar effects, as did serum from young and old animals and from both sexes. The effect on [6-14C]glucose oxidation was proportional to serum protein concentration, and significant inhibitory activity was obtained with dialyzed serum. Heating (80 degrees C for 10 minutes) significantly reduced the inhibitory activity. These results suggest the presence of a factor in serum that can preferentially decrease glucose oxidation. Such a factor would have profound implications for metabolic regulation in vivo and for studies of cells in vitro in which serum is included in the growth medium.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib are effective treatments for lung cancers with EGFR activating mutations, but these tumors invariably develop drug resistance. Here, we describe a gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line that developed resistance to gefitinib as a result of focal amplification of the MET proto-oncogene. inhibition of MET signaling in these cells restored their sensitivity to gefitinib. MET amplification was detected in 4 of 18 (22%) lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. We find that amplification of MET causes gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3 (HER3)-dependent activation of PI3K, a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR/ERBB family receptors. Thus, we propose that MET amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB-driven cancers as well.
An electrophysiological stimulation paradigm similar to one that produces Pavlovian conditioning was applied to synaptic inputs to pyramidal neurons of hippocampal brain slices. Persistent synaptic enhancement was induced in one of two weak synaptic inputs by pairing high-frequency electrical stimulation of the weak input with stimulation of a third, stronger input to the same region. Forward (temporally overlapping) but not backward (temporally separate) pairings caused this enhancement. Thus hippocampal synapses in vitro can undergo the conditional and selective type of associative modification that could provide the substrate for some of the mnemonic functions in which the hippocampus is thought to participate.
Cortical neurons form specific circuits, but the functional structure of this microarchitecture and its relation to behaviour are poorly understood. Two-photon calcium imaging can monitor activity of spatially defined neuronal ensembles in the mammalian cortex. Here we applied this technique to the motor cortex of mice performing a choice behaviour. Head-fixed mice were trained to lick in response to one of two odours, and to withhold licking for the other odour. Mice routinely showed significant learning within the first behavioural session and across sessions. Microstimulation and trans-synaptic tracing identified two non-overlapping candidate tongue motor cortical areas. Inactivating either area impaired voluntary licking. Imaging in layer 2/3 showed neurons with diverse response types in both areas. Activity in approximately half of the imaged neurons distinguished trial types associated with different actions. Many neurons showed modulation coinciding with or preceding the action, consistent with their involvement in motor control. Neurons with different response types were spatially intermingled. Nearby neurons (within approximately 150 mum) showed pronounced coincident activity. These temporal correlations increased with learning within and across behavioural sessions, specifically for neuron pairs with similar response types. We propose that correlated activity in specific ensembles of functionally related neurons is a signature of learning-related circuit plasticity. Our findings reveal a fine-scale and dynamic organization of the frontal cortex that probably underlies flexible behaviour.
In regulating the internal homeostatic environment mammals, by necessity, employ behavioral strategies that differ from the tactics used in coping with contingencies in the external environment. When an animal consumes a meal, the palatability of that meal is automatically adjusted in accordance with the ultimate internal effects of that meal. If the meal causes toxicosis, the animal acquires an aversion for the taste of the meal; conversely, if recuperation follows ingestion of the meal, the taste of that meal is enhanced. Unlike the learning that occurs when externally referred visual and auditory signals are followed by punishment in the form of peripheral pain or reward in the form of food in the mouth, conditioning to the homeostatic effects of food can occur in a single trial and rarely requires more than three to five trials, even though the ultimate effects of the meal are delayed for hours. Paradoxically, the animal need not be aware of the ultimate internal effect in the same sense that it is aware of external contingencies. For example, an aversion can be acquired even if the animal is unconscious when the agent of illness is administered. Thus, the way in which food-effects are stored in memory may be fundamentally different from the way in which memories of specific time-space strategies devised for external contingencies are stored. This separation of function is indicated by limbic lesions which disrupt conditioning to a buzzer that is followed by shock and facilitate conditioning to a taste that is followed by illness. Operationally speaking, one can describe both aversion conditioning and buzzer-shock conditioning in the spacetime associationistic terms of classical conditioning. However, psychologically speaking, one must realize that in aversion conditioning the animal does not act as if it were acquiring an "if-then" strategy. It acts as if a hedonic shift, or a change in the incentive value of the flavor were taking place. Such hedonic shifts are critical in regulation of the internal milieu. When an animal is in need of calories, food tends to be more palatable; as the caloric deficit is restored, food becomes less palatable. If the animal's body temperature is below optimum, a warm stimulus applied to the skin is pleasant. When body temperature is too high, the converse is true. In this way, homeostatic states monitored by internal receptors produce changes in the incentive values of external stimuli sensed by the peripheral receptors, and guide feeding behavior. In mammals at least, the gustatory system, which provides sensory control of feeding, sends fibers to the nucleus solitarius. This brainstem relay station also receives fibers from the viscera and the internal monitors of the area postrema. Ascending fibers bifurcate at the level of the pons and project toward the feeding areas of the hypothalamus and the cortex. The olfactory system which primarily projects to the limbic system does not play a primary role in adjusting food incentives. Rather, it plays a secondary role in the activation of feeding, as do other external sensory systems. This specialized conditioning mechanism, which specifically adjusts gustatory hedonic values through delayed visceral feedback, is widespread among animals, including man and rat. These two species are remarkably similar in their thresholds and preferences for gustatory stimuli. The behavioral similarities are based on the animals' having similar gustatory systems, similar convergence of gustatory and internal afferents to the nucleus solitarius, and similar midbrain regulatory mechanisms. Thus, it is not surprising that the feeding of obese rats with internal hypothalamic damage resembles the feeding of obese human beings insensitive to the internal signs of this caloric state. Obviously, man has a highly specialized form of symbolic communication and the rat does not, yet man's cognitive specialization does not prevent him from developing aversions to food consumed before illness even when he knows that his illness was not caused by food (43).
Inflammatory mechanisms influence tumorigenesis and metastatic progression even in cancers whose aetiology does not involve pre-existing inflammation or infection, such as breast and prostate cancers. For instance, prostate cancer metastasis is associated with the infiltration of lymphocytes into advanced tumours and the upregulation of two tumour-necrosis-factor family members: receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) and lymphotoxin. But the source of RANKL and its role in metastasis have not been established. RANKL and its receptor RANK control the proliferation of mammary lobuloalveolar cells during pregnancy through inhibitor of nuclear factor-kB (IkB) kinase-a (IKK-a), a protein kinase that is needed for the self-renewal of mammary cancer progenitors and for prostate cancer metastasis. We therefore examined whether RANKL, RANK and IKK-a are also involved in mammary/breast cancer metastasis. Indeed, RANK signalling in mammary carcinoma cells that overexpress the proto-oncogene Erbb2 (also known as Neu), which is frequently amplified in metastatic human breast cancers, was important for pulmonary metastasis. Metastatic spread of Erbb2-transformed carcinoma cells also required CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, whose major pro-metastatic function was RANKL production. Most RANKL-producing T cells expressed forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), a transcription factor produced by regulatory T cells, and were located next to smooth muscle actin (SMA)(+) stromal cells in mouse and human breast cancers. The dependence of pulmonary metastasis on T cells was replaceable by exogenous RANKL, which also stimulated pulmonary metastasis of RANK(+) human breast cancer cells. These results are consistent with the adverse impact of tumour-infiltrating CD4(+) or FOXP3(+) T cells on human breast cancer prognosis and suggest that the targeting of RANKL-RANK can be used in conjunction with the therapeutic elimination of primary breast tumours to prevent recurrent metastatic disease.
Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength may underlie learning and memory in the brain. The induction of LTP occurs in postsynaptic cells in the hippocampal CA1 region but is presynaptic in CA3. LTD is also well characterized in CA1 but not in CA3. Low-frequency stimulation of mouse hippocampal slices caused homosynaptic LTD at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse, which may be induced presynaptically by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Thus, the efficacy of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses can be regulated bidirectionally, which may contribute to neuronal information processing.
The role of molecular chaperones in assisting the folding of newly synthesized proteins in the cytosol is poorly understood. In Escherichia coli, GroEL assists folding of only a minority of proteins and the Hsp70 homologue DnaK is not essential for protein folding or cell viability at intermediate growth temperatures. The major protein associated with nascent polypeptides is ribosome-bound trigger factor, which displays chaperone and prolyl isomerase activities in vitro. Here we show that delta tig::kan mutants lacking trigger factor have no defects in growth or protein folding. However, combined delta tig::kan and delta dnaK mutations cause synthetic lethality. Depletion of DnaK in the delta tig::kan mutant results in massive aggregation of cytosolic proteins. In delta tig::kan cells, an increased amount of newly synthesized proteins associated transiently with DnaK. These findings show in vivo activity for a ribosome-associated chaperone, trigger factor, in general protein folding, and functional cooperation of this protein with a cytosolic Hsp70. Trigger factor and DnaK cooperate to promote proper folding of a variety of E. coli proteins, but neither is essential for folding and viability at intermediate growth temperatures.
A monoclonal antibody was prepared against pooled homogenates of brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease. This antibody recognizes an antigen present in much higher concentration in certain brain regions of Alzheimer patients than in normal brain. The antigen appears to be a protein present in neurons involved in the formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and in some morphologically normal neurons in sections from Alzheimer brains. Partial purification and Western blot analysis revealed the antigen from Alzheimer brain to be a single protein with a molecular weight of 68,000. Application of the same purification procedure to normal brain tissue results in the detection of small amounts of a protein of lower molecular weight.
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) represent a group of common progressive encephalopathies of children which have a global incidence of 1 in 12,500. These severe brain diseases are divided into three autosomal recessive subtypes, assigned to different chromosomal loci. The infantile subtype of NCL (INCL), linked to chromosome 1p32, is characterized by early visual loss and rapidly progressing mental deterioration, resulting in a flat electroencephalogram by 3 years of age; death occurs at 8 to 11 years, and characteristic storage bodies are found in brain and other tissues at autopsy. The molecular pathogenesis underlying the selective loss of neurons of neocortical origin has remained unknown. Here we report the identification, by positional candidate methods, of defects in the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase gene in all 42 Finnish INCL patients and several non-Finnish patients. The most common mutation results in intracellular accumulation of the polypeptide and undetectable enzyme activity in the brain of patients.
Intravenous doses of amantadine hydrochloride, an antiviral drug, as small as 0.08 milligram per kilogram may release dopamine and other catecholamines from neuronal storage sites in dogs primed with dopamine. This release may account for the reported efficacy of amantadine hydrochloride in the treatment of human parkinsonism.
We argue that cortical maps, such as those for ocular dominance, orientation and retinotopic position in primary visual cortex, can be understood in terms of dimension-reducing mappings from many-dimensional parameter spaces to the surface of the cortex. The goal of these mappings is to preserve as far as possible neighbourhood relations in parameter space so that local computations in parameter space can be performed locally in the cortex. We have found that, in a simple case, certain self-organizing models generate maps that are near-optimally local, in the sense that they come close to minimizing the neuronal wiring required for local operations. When these self-organizing models are applied to the task of simultaneously mapping retinotopic position and orientation, they produce maps with orientation vortices resembling those produced in primary visual cortex. This approach also yields a new prediction, which is that the mapping of position in visual cortex will be distorted in the orientation fracture zones.
Single neurons in the kitten visual cortex can be induced to increase their responsiveness to a repeated stimulus applied while the neurons are under observation. These short-term changes are in the same direction as the permanent modifications produced in whole populations of neurons following environmental manipulations during the "critical period" of cortical development, but are less pronounced and probably transient.
The basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins constitute a class of transcription factors thought to be important in the control of cell-type determination. These transcription factors are believed to activate the expression of cell-type-specific genes to generate stable differentiated cell types. The expression of bHLH proteins, in turn, is regulated by spatial cues, so that switches in cell type occur in a reproducible pattern. We report here that the lin-32 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans, which encodes a bHLH protein of the Drosophila achaete-scute family of transcription factors, is necessary and in some cells sufficient for specification of the neuroblast cell fate. Similarity in the function and structure of the lin-32 protein (LIN-32) to transcription factors of the achaete-scute gene family in Drosophila and vertebrates implies that this class of transcription factors functioned in a primitive ancestral form to specify neuronal cell fate, supporting the proposition that certain basic mechanisms of cell-type determination have been conserved through metazoan evolution.
Natural killer (NK) cells express inhibitory receptors for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens, preventing attack against healthy cells. Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) encodes an MHC-like protein (m157) that binds to an inhibitory NK cell receptor in certain MCMV-susceptible mice. In MCMV-resistant mice, this viral protein engages a related activating receptor (Ly49H) and confers host protection. These activating and inhibitory receptors are highly homologous, suggesting the possibility that one evolved from the other in response to selective pressure imposed by the pathogen.
The content of tetrahydrobiopterin in rat brain was doubled by peripherally administered tetrahydrobiopterin, with the natural 1 diastereoisomer more effective than the unnatural d configuration. The model pteridine, 6-methyltetrahydropterin was ten times more efficient than tetrahydrobiopterin in crossing the blood-brain barrier, and striatal concentrations of 6-methyltetrahydropterin remained elevated for 2 hours, declining with a half-life of 3 hours. While no evidence for a specific uptake mechanism for concentrating 6-methyltetrahydropterin in cells containing tetrahydrobiopterin was detected, the pterin was found in ts presumed site of action, the nerve terminal. Replacement therapy with reduced pterins may therefore be effective in the treatment of the neurological disorders associated with the variant forms of hyperphenylalaninemia that result from defects in the biosynthesis or metabolism of tetrahydrobiopterin within the central nervous system.
Our decisions are guided by information learnt from our environment. This information may come via personal experiences of reward, but also from the behaviour of social partners. Social learning is widely held to be distinct from other forms of learning in its mechanism and neural implementation; it is often assumed to compete with simpler mechanisms, such as reward-based associative learning, to drive behaviour. Recently, neural signals have been observed during social exchange reminiscent of signals seen in studies of associative learning. Here we demonstrate that social information may be acquired using the same associative processes assumed to underlie reward-based learning. We find that key computational variables for learning in the social and reward domains are processed in a similar fashion, but in parallel neural processing streams. Two neighbouring divisions of the anterior cingulate cortex were central to learning about social and reward-based information, and for determining the extent to which each source of information guides behaviour. When making a decision, however, the information learnt using these parallel streams was combined within ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that human social valuation can be realized by means of the same associative processes previously established for learning other, simpler, features of the environment.
During the regeneration of Drosophila imaginal discs, cellular identities can switch fate in a process known as transdetermination. For leg-to-wing transdetermination, the underlying mechanism involves morphogens such as Wingless that, when activated outside their normal context, induce ectopic expression of the wing-specific selector gene vestigial. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain cellular fates by controlling the expression patterns of homeotic genes and other developmental regulators. Here we report that transdetermination events are coupled to PcG regulation. We show that the frequency of transdetermination is enhanced in PcG mutant flies. Downregulation of PcG function, as monitored by the reactivation of a silent PcG-regulated reporter gene, is observed in transdetermined cells. This downregulation is directly controlled by the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathway, which is activated in cells undergoing regeneration. Accordingly, transdetermination frequency is reduced in a JNK mutant background. This regulatory interaction also occurs in mammalian cells, indicating that the role of this signalling cascade in remodelling cellular fates may be conserved.
Treatment with the dopamine precursor L-dopa produced a significant accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in the caudate nucleus of the rat. In contrast, there was no change in the amount of cyclic AMP in the cerebellum. Accumulation of cyclic AMP in the caudate nucleus after administration of L-dopa was prevented by prior treatment with the decarboxylase inhibitor RO 4-4602. These observations and those in other laboratories support the assumption that dopamine formed from L-dopa selectively activates striatal adenylate cyclase. The in vivo activation of adenylate cyclase after treatment with L-dopa may be a useful model for studying neurological and psychiatric disorders that are thought to involve the dopaminergic system of the brain.
The signaling pathways by which beta-adrenergic agonists modulate voltage-dependent cardiac sodium currents are unknown, although it is likely that adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cAMP) is involved. Single-channel and whole-cell sodium currents were measured in cardiac myocytes and the signal transducing G protein Gs was found to couple beta-adrenergic receptors to sodium channels by both cytoplasmic (indirect) and membrane-delimited (direct) pathways. Hence, Gs can act on at least three effectors in the heart: sodium channels, calcium channels, and adenylyl cyclase. The effect on sodium currents was inhibitory and was enhanced by membrane depolarization. During myocardial ischemia the sodium currents of depolarized cells may be further inhibited by the accompanying increase in catecholamine levels.
There is an increasing amount of experimental evidence that oxidative stress is a causal, or at least an ancillary, factor in the neuropathology of several adult neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in stroke, trauma, and seizures. At the same time, excessive or persistent activation of glutamate-gated ion channels may cause neuronal degeneration in these same conditions. Glutamate and related acidic amino acids are thought to be the major excitatory neurotransmitters in brain and may be utilized by 40 percent of the synapses. Thus, two broad mechanisms--oxidative stress and excessive activation of glutamate receptors--are converging and represent sequential as well as interacting processes that provide a final common pathway for cell vulnerability in the brain. The broad distribution in brain of the processes regulating oxidative stress and mediating glutamatergic neurotransmission may explain the wide range of disorders in which both have been implicated. Yet differential expression of components of the processes in particular neuronal systems may account for selective neurodegeneration in certain disorders.
Medial temporal lobe structures have been implicated in human episodic memory. Patients with medial temporal lesions show memory deficits, and functional neuroimaging studies have revealed activation in this region during episodic encoding and retrieval when data are averaged over a sample of subjects. The relevance of such observations for memory performance has remained unclear, however. Here we have used positron emission tomography (PET) to examine cerebral blood flow related to verbal episodic retrieval. We observed strong positive correlations between retrieval and blood flow in left medial temporal structures in individual normal human subjects. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that regions in the left medial temporal lobe were dominant components of a pattern of brain regions that distinguished a high-retrieval condition from conditions of lower retrieval. These results suggest that medial temporal activity is related to retrieval success rather than retrieval attempt, possibly by reflecting reactivation of stored patterns.
The G2-M phase transition in eukaryotes is regulated by the synergistic and opposing activities of a cascade of distinct protein kinases and phosphatases. This cascade converges on Cdc2, a serine/threonine protein kinase required for entry into mitosis (reviewed in ref. 1). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, inactivation of the Cdc2/cyclin B complex is achieved by phosphorylation of tyrosine 15 by Wee1 (refs 2,3). The action of the Wee1 kinase is opposed by the action of the Cdc25 phosphatase, which dephosphorylates Cdc2 on tyrosine 15, thereby activating the Cdc2/cyclin B complex. Much less is known about the regulatory signals upstream of cdc25 and wee1. Genetics indicate that the mitotic inducer nim1/cdr1 acts upstream of wee1, possibly as a negative regulator of wee1 (refs 10, 11). To characterize the nim1/cdr1 protein (Nim1), we have overproduced it in both bacterial and baculoviral expression systems. We report that Nim1 possesses intrinsic serine-kinase, threonine-kinase and tyrosine-kinase activities. Co-expression of the Nim1 and Wee1 kinases in insect cells results in the phosphorylation of Wee1 and therefore a shift in its electrophoretic mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. When Wee1 is phosphorylated, its ability to phosphorylate Cdc2 on tyrosine 15 is inhibited; treatment with phosphatase restores this kinase activity. Furthermore, purified bacterially produced Nim1 kinase directly phosphorylates and inactivates Wee1 in vitro. These results show that nim1/cdr1 functions as a positive regulator of mitosis by directly phosphorylating and inactivating the mitotic inhibitor Wee1.
Inhibition of calcification in embryonic bone rudiments was studied in the presence of several tetracyclines at three different concentrations. Different criteria for calcification and different concentrations of tetracyclines yielded parallel results and showed significant differences in the inhibitory action of the various compounds. The clear-cut results indicate that the test-system that was developed may be useful for the comparison of various teratogens under simplified controllable conditions.
The deleterious effects of ethanol on the developing human brain are poorly understood. Here it is reported that ethanol, acting by a dual mechanism [blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors and excessive activation of GABA(A) receptors], triggers widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat forebrain. Vulnerability coincides with the period of synaptogenesis, which in humans extends from the sixth month of gestation to several years after birth. During this period, transient ethanol exposure can delete millions of neurons from the developing brain. This can explain the reduced brain mass and neurobehavioral disturbances associated with human fetal alcohol syndrome.
Lasting modifications of the receptive fields of neurons in the visual cortex can be induced by pairing visual stimuli with iontophoretic application of the neuromodulators acetylcholine and noradrenaline or the excitatory amino acids N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and L-glutamate. The modifications are obtained in less than 1 hour and persist for more than 40 minutes. Thus, acetylcholine and norepinephrine have a permissive role in use-dependent neuronal plasticity. These results support the notion of a postsynaptic threshold for neuronal malleability that differs from that of sodium-dependent action potentials.
The principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, L-glutamate, acts on three classes of ionotripic glutamate receptors, named after the agonists AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxalole-4-propionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and kainate. The development of selective pharmacological agents has led to a detailed understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of AMPA and NMDA receptors. In contrast, the lack of selective kainate receptor ligands has greatly hindered progress in understanding the roles of kainate receptors. Here we describe the effects of a potent and selective agonist, ATPA ((RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid) and a selective antagonist, LY294486 ((3SR, 4aRS, 6SR, 8aRS)-6-((((1H-tetrazol-5-yl) methyl)oxy)methyl)-1, 2, 3, 4, 4a, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid), of the GluR5 subtype of kainate receptor. We have used these agents to show that kainate receptors, comprised of or containing GluR5 subunits, regulate synaptic inhibition in the hippocampus, an action that could contribute to the epileptogenic effects of kainate.
Hereditary non-neuropathic systemic amyloidosis (Ostertag-type) is a rare autosomal dominant disease in which amyloid deposition in the viscera is usually fatal by the fifth decade. In some families it is caused by mutations in the apolipoprotein AI gene but in two unrelated English families under our care the amyloid deposits did not contain apoAI, despite a report that this may have been the case in one of them. Lysozyme is a ubiquitous bacteriolytic enzyme present in external secretions and in polymorphs and macrophages, but its physiological role is not always clear. Here we report that in these two families, lysozyme is the amyloid fibril protein. Affected individuals are heterozygous for point mutations in the lysozyme gene that cause substitution of highly conserved residues, namely threonine for isoleucine at position 56 in one family, and histidine for aspartic acid at residue 67 in the other. Amyloid fibrils from one individual were composed of the full-length Thr-56 variant lysozyme molecule. To our knowledge, this is the first report of naturally occurring variants of human lysozyme and of lysozyme-associated disease. As the structures of human and hen egg-white lysozyme are known to atomic resolution and their folding and structure-function relationships have been exhaustively analysed, our observations should provide a powerful model for understanding amyloidogenesis.
In the visual cortex of mammals, response properties of single neurons can be changed by restricted visual experience during early postnatal development. Covering one eye for four to eight hours when kittens are at the peak of the sensitive period is sufficient to weaken the influence of the occluded eye on cortical neurons resulting in a noticeable shift of ocular dominance towards the open eye. The underlying changes in synaptic connections do not occur so readily when a kitten is anaesthetized and paralysed. We report here that an ocular dominance shift is prevented in alert kittens that receive repeated brief monocular exposures when these are followed by ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia. This retrograde effect on cortical plasticity suggests that the process by which synaptic activity is converted into structural changes has been disturbed.
Efficient control of synaptic transmission requires a rapid mechanism for terminating the actions of neurotransmitters. For amino acids and monoamines, this is achieved by their uptake into the cell by specific high-affinity transporters; acetylcholine is first broken down in the extracellular space and then choline is taken up by the cell. Because ATP is hydrolysed to adenosine by membrane-bound enzymes (ectonucleotidases) that are present in most tissues, it has been assumed that these enzymes terminate the neurotransmitter actions of ATP in the brain and in the periphery. We show here, however, that stimulation of sympathetic nerves innervating the guinea-pig vas deferens releases not only neuronal ATP, but also soluble nucleotidases that break down this ATP to adenosine, indicating that inactivation of ATP is increased by nerve activity. This release of specific nucleotidases together with ATP represents a new mechanism for terminating the actions of a neurotransmitter.
In the central nervous system, ageing results in a precipitous decline in adult neural stem/progenitor cells and neurogenesis, with concomitant impairments in cognitive functions. Interestingly, such impairments can be ameliorated through systemic perturbations such as exercise. Here, using heterochronic parabiosis we show that blood-borne factors present in the systemic milieu can inhibit or promote adult neurogenesis in an age-dependent fashion in mice. Accordingly, exposing a young mouse to an old systemic environment or to plasma from old mice decreased synaptic plasticity, and impaired contextual fear conditioning and spatial learning and memory. We identify chemokines--including CCL11 (also known as eotaxin)--the plasma levels of which correlate with reduced neurogenesis in heterochronic parabionts and aged mice, and the levels of which are increased in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of healthy ageing humans. Lastly, increasing peripheral CCL11 chemokine levels in vivo in young mice decreased adult neurogenesis and impaired learning and memory. Together our data indicate that the decline in neurogenesis and cognitive impairments observed during ageing can be in part attributed to changes in blood-borne factors.
Secretory activity of the anterior pituitary gland is regulated by the brain through stimulatory and inhibitory substances released from nerve endings in the median eminence of the hypothalamus and carried by the adenohypophysial portal blood system to their respective target cells. These hypothalamic influences are modulated by the feedback action of peripheral hormones. Prolactin (PRL) secreting cells are, at least partially, under the stimulatory influence of thyrotropin releasing hromone (TRH) and of oestrogens. However, they are mainly controlled by inhibitory substances among which dopamine (DA) is one of the most potent in vivo as well as in vitro. The inhibitory effect of DA is reversed by oestrogen in vitro. The mechanism by which these factors interact on their target cells is poorly understood. The recent discovery that anterior pituitary cells are excitable and that they are able to generate Ca2+-dependent action potentials has led to the suggestion that these effects are involved in a stimulus-secretion coupling at the membrane level. In this paper, we report that DA inhibits both the spontaneous and TRH-induced action potentials in clonal PRL pituitary cells. In addition, oestradiol-17 beta is able to reverse the inhibitory effect of DA.
The dopamine-containing projection from the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain to the nucleus accumbens is critically involved in mediating the reinforcing properties of cocaine. Although neurons in this area respond to rewards on a subsecond timescale, neurochemical studies have only addressed the role of dopamine in drug addiction by examining changes in the tonic (minute-to-minute) levels of extracellular dopamine. To investigate the role of phasic (subsecond) dopamine signalling, we measured dopamine every 100 ms in the nucleus accumbens using electrochemical technology. Rapid changes in extracellular dopamine concentration were observed at key aspects of drug-taking behaviour in rats. Before lever presses for cocaine, there was an increase in dopamine that coincided with the initiation of drug-seeking behaviours. Notably, these behaviours could be reproduced by electrically evoking dopamine release on this timescale. After lever presses, there were further increases in dopamine concentration at the concurrent presentation of cocaine-related cues. These cues alone also elicited similar, rapid dopamine signalling, but only in animals where they had previously been paired to cocaine delivery. These findings reveal an unprecedented role for dopamine in the regulation of drug taking in real time.
The ability to "mentalize," that is to understand and manipulate other people's behavior in terms of their mental states, is a major ingredient in successful social interactions. A rudimentary form of this ability may be seen in great apes, but in humans it is developed to a high level. Specific impairments of mentalizing in both developmental and acquired disorders suggest that this ability depends on a dedicated and circumscribed brain system. Functional imaging studies implicate medial prefrontal cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) as components of this system. Clues to the specific function of these components in mentalizing come from single cell recording studies: STS is concerned with representing the actions of others through the detection of biological motion; medial prefrontal regions are concerned with explicit representation of states of the self. These observations suggest that the ability to mentalize has evolved from a system for representing actions.
Severe deafness or hearing impairment is the most prevalent inherited sensory disorder, affecting about 1 in 1,000 children. Most deafness results from peripheral auditory defects that occur as a consequence of either conductive (outer or middle ear) or sensorineuronal (cochlea) abnormalities. Although a number of mutant genes have been identified that are responsible for syndromic (multiple phenotypic disease) deafness such as Waardenburg syndrome and Usher 1B syndrome, little is known about the genetic basis of non-syndromic (single phenotypic disease) deafness. Here we study a pedigree containing cases of autosomal dominant deafness and have identified a mutation in the gene encoding the gap-junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26) that segregates with the profound deafness in the family. Cx26 mutations resulting in premature stop codons were also found in three autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineuronal deafness pedigrees, genetically linked to chromosome 13q11-12 (DFNB1), where the Cx26 gene is localized. Immunohistochemical staining of human cochlear cells for Cx26 demonstrated high levels of expression. To our knowledge, this is the first non-syndromic sensorineural autosomal deafness susceptibility gene to be identified, which implicates Cx26 as an important component of the human cochlea.
The adapter protein ADAP regulates T lymphocyte adhesion and activation. We present evidence for a previously unrecognized function for ADAP in regulating T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Stimulation of ADAP-deficient mouse T cells with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 resulted in impaired nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, a reduced DNA binding, and delayed degradation and decreased phosphorylation of IkappaB (inhibitor of NF-kappaB). TCR-stimulated assembly of the CARMA1-BCL-10-MALT1 complex was substantially impaired in the absence of ADAP. We further identified a region of ADAP that is required for association with the CARMA1 adapter and NF-kappaB activation but is not required for ADAP-dependent regulation of adhesion. These findings provide new insights into ADAP function and the mechanism by which CARMA1 regulates NF-kappaB activation in T cells.
Many plant genes that respond to environmental and developmental changes are regulated by jasmonic acid, which is derived from linolenic acid via the octadecanoid pathway. Linolenic acid is an important fatty-acid constituent of membranes in most plant species and its intracellular levels increase in response to certain signals. Here we report that irradiation of tomato leaves with ultraviolet light induces the expression of several plant defensive genes that are normally activated through the octadecanoid pathway after wounding. The response to ultraviolet light is blocked by an inhibitor of the octadecanoid pathway and it does not occur in a tomato mutant defective in this pathway. The ultraviolet irradiation maximally induces the defence genes at levels where cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer formation, an indicator of DNA damage, is less than 0.2 dimers per gene. Our evidence indicates that this plant defence response to certain wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation requires the activation of the octadecanoid defence signalling pathway.
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) has been implicated in the ongoing neurogenesis in postnatal rodent brains. Here we adopted an in vivo genetic fate-mapping strategy, using Gli1 (GLI-Kruppel family member) as a sensitive readout of Shh activity, to systematically mark and follow the fate of Shh-responding cells in the adult mouse forebrain. We show that initially, only a small population of cells (including both quiescent neural stem cells and transit-amplifying cells) responds to Shh in regions undergoing neurogenesis. This population subsequently expands markedly to continuously provide new neurons in the forebrain. Our study of the behaviour of quiescent neural stem cells provides in vivo evidence that they can self-renew for over a year and generate multiple cell types. Furthermore, we show that the neural stem cell niches in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus are established sequentially and not until late embryonic stages.
Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was originally characterized as a survival factor for chick ciliary neurons in vitro. More recently, it was shown to promote the survival of a variety of other neuronal cell types and to affect the differentiation of E7 chick sympathetic neurons by inhibiting their proliferation and by inducing the expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide immunoreactivity (VIP-IR). In cultures of dissociated sympathetic neurons from newborn rats, CNTF induces cholinergic differentiation as shown by increased levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). This increase is paralleled by a reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity. Moreover, CNTF promotes the differentiation of bipotential 02A progenitor cells to type-2-astrocytes in vitro. To help establish which, if any, of these functions CNTF exerts in vivo, it is necessary to determine its primary structure, cellular expression, developmental regulation and localization. The complementary DNA-deduced amino-acid sequence and subsequent expression of cDNA clones covering the entire coding region in HeLa-cells indicate that CNTF is a cytosolic protein. This, together with its regional distribution and its developmental expression, show that CNTF is not a target-derived neurotrophic factor. CNTF thus seems to exhibit neurotrophic and differentiation properties only after becoming available either by cellular lesion or by an unknown release mechanism.
From birth to day 21, rat offspring received daily injections of naltrexone at a dosage that blocked morphine-induced analgesia 24 hours a day. At 21 days, body, brain, and cerebellar weights of naltrexone-injected animals were 18, 11, and 5 percent greater than corresponding control weights. In addition, morphometric analysis of the cerebrum revealed a somatosensory cortex that was 18 percent thicker than that of the controls. The cerebellum of naltrexone-treated rats was 41 percent larger in total area and contained at least 70 percent more glial cells and 30 percent more granule neurons. Neurons derived prenatally were unaffected by drug treatment. These results show that naltrexone can stimulate body and brain growth in rats and suggest a role for the endorphin and opiate receptor system in development.
Virtually all of the 560 human proteases are stored as inactive proenyzmes and are strictly regulated. We report the identification and characterization of the first small molecules that directly activate proenzymes, the apoptotic procaspases-3 and -6. It is surprising that these compounds induce autoproteolytic activation by stabilizing a conformation that is both more active and more susceptible to intermolecular proteolysis. These procaspase activators bypass the normal upstream proapoptotic signaling cascades and induce rapid apoptosis in a variety of cell lines. Systematic biochemical and biophysical analyses identified a cluster of mutations in procaspase-3 that resist small-molecule activation both in vitro and in cells. Compounds that induce gain of function are rare, and the activators reported here will enable direct control of the executioner caspases in apoptosis and in cellular differentiation. More generally, these studies presage the discovery of other proenzyme activators to explore fundamental processes of proenzyme activation and their fate-determining roles in biology.
Measles virus generally produces acute illness. Rarely, however, persistent infection of brain cells occurs, resulting in a chronic and fatal neurological disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Evidence indicates that expression of the measles virus matrix protein is selectively restricted in this persistent infection, but the mechanism underlying this restriction has not been identified. Defective translation of matrix messenger RNA has been described in one SSPE cell line. This report presents evidence that in a different SSPE tissue culture cell line IP-3-Ca, the matrix protein is synthesized but fails to accumulate. A general scheme is proposed to reconcile the different levels at which restriction of matrix protein has been observed.
Variants of the Dearing strain of reovirus type 3 with antigenically altered hemagglutinin proteins are much less neurovirulent than the parental virus. When injected intracerebrally into mice these variants infected a subset of the brain neurons that were infected by the parental virus. When injected intraperitoneally, the variants did not spread to the brain. These results indicate that minor modifications of the reovirus hemagglutinin dramatically alter the ability of the virus to spread into and injure the central nervous system.
A new type of agonist-binding subunit of rat neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) was identified. Rat genomic DNA and complementary DNA encoding this subunit (alpha 2) were cloned and analyzed. Complementary DNA expression studies in Xenopus oocytes revealed that the injection of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for alpha 2 and beta 2 (a neuronal nAChR subunit) led to the generation of a functional nAChR. In contrast to the other known neuronal nAChRs, the receptor produced by the injection of alpha 2 and beta 2 mRNAs was resistant to the alpha-neurotoxin Bgt3.1. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed that alpha 2 mRNA was expressed in a small number of regions, in contrast to the wide distribution of the other known agonist-binding subunits (alpha 3 and alpha 4) mRNAs. These results demonstrate that the alpha 2 subunit differs from other known agonist-binding alpha-subunits of nAChRs in its distribution in the brain and in its pharmacology.
In all synapses, Ca2+ triggers neurotransmitter release to initiate signal transmission. Ca2+ presumably acts by activating synaptic Ca2+ sensors, but the nature of these sensors--which are the gatekeepers to neurotransmission--remains unclear. One of the candidate Ca2+ sensors in release is the synaptic Ca2+-binding protein synaptotagmin I. Here we have studied a point mutation in synaptotagmin I that causes a twofold decrease in overall Ca2+ affinity without inducing structural or conformational changes. When introduced by homologous recombination into the endogenous synaptotagmin I gene in mice, this point mutation decreases the Ca2+ sensitivity of neurotransmitter release twofold, but does not alter spontaneous release or the size of the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters. Therefore, Ca2+ binding to synaptotagmin I participates in triggering neurotransmitter release at the synapse.
Immature rat brain tissue grafted to the brain of other immature and adult rats can survive and establish nerve connections with the host brains. In addition to facilitating the study of factors involved in the formation of central neural connections, brain grafts may also be used to substitute damaged or maldeveloped neurones. With exceptions in the visual system, the restoration of specific central neural connections has to date involved grafts of cholinergic and monoaminergic neurones, which have good regenerative capacity. In the present study, rat hippocampal neurones were damaged by neonatal X-ray irradiation and replaced by transplantation of normal, developing neurones of the same type. The grafted neurones (dentate granule cells) are not cholinergic or monoaminergic, but when appropriately located in the host hippocampal region they established specific and highly ordered afferent and efferent connections with the damaged host brain. Moreover, simultaneous demonstration of afferent and efferent transplant pathways showed that serial host-transplant-host connections had formed, restoring the normal neuronal circuitry initially disrupted by the irradiation.
Malignant rhabdoid tumours (MRTs) are extremely aggressive cancers of early childhood. They can occur in various locations, mainly the kidney, brain and soft tissues. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses have shown that the deletion of region 11.2 of the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11.2) is a recurrent genetic characteristic of MRTs, indicating that this locus may encode a tumour suppressor gene. Here we map the most frequently deleted part of chromosome 22q11.2 from a panel of 13 MRT cell lines. We observed six homozygous deletions that delineate the smallest region of overlap between the cell lines. This region is found in the hSNF5/INI1 gene, which encodes a member of the chromatin-remodelling SWI/SNF multiprotein complexes. We analysed the sequence of hSNF5/INI1 and found frameshift or nonsense mutations of this gene in six other cell lines. These truncating mutations of one allele were associated with the loss of the other allele. Identical alterations were observed in corresponding primary tumour DNAs but not in matched constitutional DNAs, indicating that they had been acquired somatically. The observation of bi-allelic alterations of hSNF5/INI1 in MRTs suggests that loss-of-function mutations of hSNF5/INI1 contribute to oncogenesis.
During the initial phase of their development, sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) require target-derived trophic support for their survival, but as they mature they lose this requirement. Because many of these neurons express BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) messenger RNA, we hypothesized that BDNF might act as an autocrine survival factor in adult DRG neurons, thus explaining their lack of dependence on exogenous growth factors. When cultured adult DRG cells were treated with antisense oligonucleotides to BDNF, expression of BDNF protein was reduced by 80%, and neuronal survival was reduced by 35%. These neurons could be rescued by exogenous BDNF or neurotrophin-3, but not by other growth factors. Similar results were obtained with single-neuron microcultures, whereas microcultures derived from mutant mice lacking BDNF were unaffected by antisense oligonucleotides. Our results strongly support an autocrine role for BDNF in mediating the survival of a subpopulation of adult DRG neurons.
Humans and cats can localize a sound source accurately if its spectrum is fairly broad and flat, as is typical of most natural sounds. However, if sounds are filtered to reduce the width of the spectrum, they result in illusions of sources that are very different from the actual locations, particularly in the up/down and front/back dimensions. Such illusions reveal that the auditory system relies on specific characteristics of sound spectra to obtain cues for localization. In the auditory cortex of cats, temporal firing patterns of neurons can signal the locations of broad-band sounds. Here we show that such spike patterns systematically mislocalize sounds that have been passed through a narrow-band filter. Both correct and incorrect locations signalled by neurons can be predicted quantitatively by a model of spectral processing that also predicts correct and incorrect localization judgements by human listeners. Similar cortical mechanisms, if present in humans, could underlie human auditory spatial perception.
Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are first identifiable as a population of about eight alkaline phosphatase-positive cells in the 7.0 days postcoitum mouse embryo. During the next 6 days of development they proliferate to give rise to the 25,000 cells that will establish the meiotic population. Steel factor is required for PGC survival both in vivo and in vitro and together with leukaemia inhibitory factor stimulates PGC proliferation in vitro. In feeder-dependent culture, PGCs will proliferate for up to 7 days, but their numbers eventually decline and their proliferative capacity is only a fraction of that seen in vivo. Here we report a further factor that stimulates PGC proliferation in vitro, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Furthermore, bFGF, in the presence of steel factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor, stimulates long-term proliferation of PGCs, leading to the derivation of large colonies of cells. These embryonic germ cells resemble embryonic stem cells, pluripotent cells derived from preimplantation embryos, or feeder-dependent embryonal carcinoma cells, pluripotent stem cells of PGC-derived tumours (teratomas and teratocarcinomas). To our knowledge, these results provide the first system for long-term culture of PGCs.
The effect of ethanol on hippocampal axonal sprouting was studied with a histochemical technique for identifying acetylcholinesterase. Unilateral lesion of the entorhinal cortex in adult rats produced an increase in the density of acetylcholinesterase staining in the outer molecular layer and a concomitant increase in the width of the pale-staining commissural-associational zone of the dentate gyrus. Other rats were given ethanol (11.3 +/- 0.45 grams per kilogram) for 2 weeks before and 9 days after receiving the lesion. Ethanol abolished the expansion of the commissural-associated zone. The effect of ethanol on sprouting axons suggests that it may inhibit recovery of function after brain injury.
A 3-micromolar concentration of tetrodotoxin completely inhibits the stimulation of respiration of rat brain cortex that takes place upon application of electrical impulses. It also inhibits increase in the rate of the respiration that occurs when calcium ions are omitted from the incubation medium. No effect of tetrodotoxin on brain respiration takes place when stimulation is brought about by the addition of 100 millimolar potassium chloride. Tetrodotoxin prevents the fall in the rate of oxidation of cerebral acetate that occurs during electrical stimulation but does not affect the increased rate of the oxidation that occurs in the presence of an increased concentration of potassium chloride. The data indicate that oxidation of cerebral acetate is diminished by influx of sodium ions, which is prevented by tetrodotoxin, and is increased by influx of potassium ions, which is unaffected by tetrodotoxin.
There is now evidence that the immune system, during times of infectious challenge, can stimulate the secretion of glucocorticoids, the adrenal steroids that mediate important aspects of the response to stress. Specifically, secretion of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a monocyte lymphokine secreted after infection, appears at least in part responsible for this effect. Glucocorticoids are secreted in response to a neuroendocrine cascade involving, first, the brain, then the pituitary, and finally the adrenal gland. In this report, human IL-1 is shown to activate the adrenocortical axis at the level of the brain, stimulating the release of the controlling hormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus. Infusion of IL-1 induced a significant secretion of CRF into the circulation exiting the hypothalamus, whereas immunoneutralization of CRF blocked the stimulatory effect of IL-1 on glucocorticoid secretion. IL-1 appeared to have no acute direct stimulatory effects on the pituitary or adrenal components of this system. Furthermore, IL-1 did not cause a nonspecific release of other hypothalamic hormones. Thus, the lymphokine acts in a specific manner to activate the adrenocortical axis at the level of the brain; this effect appears to be unrelated to the known pyrogenic effects of IL-1 within the hypothalamus.
The GXGD proteases are polytopic membrane proteins with catalytic activities against membrane-spanning substrates that require a pair of aspartyl residues. Representative members of the family include preflagellin peptidase, type 4 prepilin peptidase, presenilin and signal peptide peptidase. Many GXGD proteases are important in medicine. For example, type 4 prepilin peptidase may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis, and mutations in presenilin are associated with Alzheimer's disease. As yet, there is no atomic-resolution structure in this protease family. Here we report the crystal structure of FlaK, a preflagellin peptidase from Methanococcus maripaludis, solved at 3.6 A resolution. The structure contains six transmembrane helices. The GXGD motif and a short transmembrane helix, helix 4, are positioned at the centre, surrounded by other transmembrane helices. The crystal structure indicates that the protease must undergo conformational changes to bring the GXGD motif and a second essential aspartyl residue from transmembrane helix 1 into close proximity for catalysis. A comparison of the crystal structure with models of presenilin derived from biochemical analysis reveals three common transmembrane segments that are similarly arranged around the active site. This observation reinforces the idea that the prokaryotic and human proteases are evolutionarily related. The crystal structure presented here provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of the GXGD proteases, and may facilitate the rational design of inhibitors that target specific members of the family.
A putative tumor suppressor locus on the short arm of human chromosome 9 has been localized to a region of less than 40 kilobases by means of homozygous deletions in melanoma cell lines. This region contained a gene, Multiple Tumor Suppressor 1 (MTS1), that encodes a previously identified inhibitor (p16) of cyclin-dependent kinase 4. MTS1 was homozygously deleted at high frequency in cell lines derived from tumors of lung, breast, brain, bone, skin, bladder, kidney, ovary, and lymphocyte. Melanoma cell lines that carried at least one copy of MTS1 frequently carried nonsense, missense, or frameshift mutations in the gene. These findings suggest that MTS1 mutations are involved in tumor formation in a wide range of tissues.
Two vertebrate hypocholesterolemic agents (triparanol and 22,25-diazacholesterol) block the conversion of beta-sitosterol to cholesterol in the larva of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (Johannson). A primary site of inhibitory action is the terminal step in this conversion-the reduction of desmosterol (24-dehydrocholesterol) to cholesterol. This is also the site at which these compounds inhibit de novo cholesterol biosynthesis in higher animals. Both agents severely inhibit growth and maturation of the tobacco hornworm.
The effects of diffuse cerebral dysfunction on oculomotor reaction time were assessed in patients with dementia of presumed Alzheimer's etiology and in normal age-matched control subjects. Patients were classified into mild, moderate, and severe groups on the basis of independent neurological, neuropsychological, and neuroradiological ratings for disease severity. Saccadic latencies to targets appearing in parafoveal and near peripheral vision showed significant increases from the normal controls to dementia groups, with each severity subdivision clearly differentiated from the others in terms of mean oculomotor reaction time. These data offer strong evidence for a direct relationship between degree of cortical structural integrity and simple oculomotor reaction time and suggest a higher cortical regulatory role in sensory-motor integration.
Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is critical in the regulation of vascular function, and can generate both nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O(2)(*-)), which are key mediators of cellular signalling. In the presence of Ca(2+)/calmodulin, eNOS produces NO, endothelial-derived relaxing factor, from l-arginine (l-Arg) by means of electron transfer from NADPH through a flavin containing reductase domain to oxygen bound at the haem of an oxygenase domain, which also contains binding sites for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) and l-Arg. In the absence of BH(4), NO synthesis is abrogated and instead O(2)(*-) is generated. While NOS dysfunction occurs in diseases with redox stress, BH(4) repletion only partly restores NOS activity and NOS-dependent vasodilation. This suggests that there is an as yet unidentified redox-regulated mechanism controlling NOS function. Protein thiols can undergo S-glutathionylation, a reversible protein modification involved in cellular signalling and adaptation. Under oxidative stress, S-glutathionylation occurs through thiol-disulphide exchange with oxidized glutathione or reaction of oxidant-induced protein thiyl radicals with reduced glutathione. Cysteine residues are critical for the maintenance of eNOS function; we therefore speculated that oxidative stress could alter eNOS activity through S-glutathionylation. Here we show that S-glutathionylation of eNOS reversibly decreases NOS activity with an increase in O(2)(*-) generation primarily from the reductase, in which two highly conserved cysteine residues are identified as sites of S-glutathionylation and found to be critical for redox-regulation of eNOS function. We show that eNOS S-glutathionylation in endothelial cells, with loss of NO and gain of O(2)(*-) generation, is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In hypertensive vessels, eNOS S-glutathionylation is increased with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation that is restored by thiol-specific reducing agents, which reverse this S-glutathionylation. Thus, S-glutathionylation of eNOS is a pivotal switch providing redox regulation of cellular signalling, endothelial function and vascular tone.
Brief tetanic stimulation of the preganglionic nerves to the superior cervical ganglion enhances the postganglionic response to single preganglionic stimuli for 1 to 3 hours. This long-term potentiation of transmission through the ganglion is apparently not attributable to a persistent muscarinic action of the preganglionic neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, since neither the magnitude nor the time course of the phenomenon is reduced by atropine. The decay of long-term potentiation can be described by a first-order kinetic process with a mean time constant of 80 minutes. We conclude that long-term potentiation, once considered a unique property of the hippocampus, is in fact a more general feature of synaptic function. This form of synaptic memory may significantly influence information processing and control in other regions of the nervous system, including autonomic ganglia.
High propensity for breast cancer in mice was associated with low dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the brain, low spontaneous motorization, and low motor responses to injections of the catecholamine precursor, L-dopa.
A 4-base pair deletion in the neuronal serine protease neurotrypsin gene was associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation (MR). In situ hybridization experiments on human fetal brains showed that neurotrypsin was highly expressed in brain structures involved in learning and memory. Immuno-electron microscopy on adult human brain sections revealed that neurotrypsin is located in presynaptic nerve endings, particularly over the presynaptic membrane lining the synaptic cleft. These findings suggest that neurotrypsin-mediated proteolysis is required for normal synaptic function and suggest potential insights into the pathophysiological bases of mental retardation.
Glucagon suppression by somatostatin reduces or abolishes hyperglycemia in dogs made insulin-deficient by somatostatin, alloxan, or total pancreatectomy. This suggests that the development of severe diabetic hyperglycemia requires the presence of glucagon, whether secreted by pancreatic or newly identified gastrointestinal A cells, as well as a lack of insulin. Glucagon suppression could improve therapeutic glucoregulation in diabetes.
Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are important regulators of intracellular signal-transduction pathways mediating development and multicellular communication in metazoans. Their activity is normally tightly controlled and regulated. Perturbation of PTK signalling by mutations and other genetic alterations results in deregulated kinase activity and malignant transformation. The lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) and some of its downstream targets, such as the protein-serine/threonine kinases Akt and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), are crucial effectors in oncogenic PTK signalling. This review emphasizes how oncogenic conversion of protein kinases results from perturbation of the normal autoinhibitory constraints on kinase activity and provides an update on our knowledge about the role of deregulated PI(3)K/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6K signalling in human malignancies.
It has been reported that a preparation obtained from prothlalli of the fern species Anemia phyllitidis controls antheridium formation in this species. If this same preparation is applied at the spore stage it induces a physiological state antagonistic to antheridium formation. The inhibitory state is inducible only at a very early stage of development, but, once induced, it remains manifest at much later stages. Quite possibly, the inhibitory state arises in response to the factor that induces formation of anitlheridia. The inhibitory state may have an important function in fern development.
Mutations in the gene encoding the amyloid protein precursor (APP) cause autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Cleavage of APP by unidentified proteases, referred to as beta- and gamma-secretases, generates the amyloid beta-peptide, the main component of the amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer's disease patients. The disease-causing mutations flank the protease cleavage sites in APP and facilitate its cleavage. Here we identify a new membrane-bound aspartyl protease (Asp2) with beta-secretase activity. The Asp2 gene is expressed widely in brain and other tissues. Decreasing the expression of Asp2 in cells reduces amyloid beta-peptide production and blocks the accumulation of the carboxy-terminal APP fragment that is created by beta-secretase cleavage. Solubilized Asp2 protein cleaves a synthetic APP peptide substrate at the beta-secretase site, and the rate of cleavage is increased tenfold by a mutation associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease in Sweden. Thus, Asp2 is a new protein target for drugs that are designed to block the production of amyloid beta-peptide peptide and the consequent formation of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease.
Concentrations of norepinephrine in cerebrospinal fluid are higher in schizophrenic patients, particularly in those with paranoid features, than in normal volunteer subjects of the same age. This observation supports recent reports of elevated concentrations of norepinephrine in specific brain areas adjacent to the cerebral ventricles of paranoid schizophrenic patients. Overflow of the amine from periventricular regions into the cerebrospinal fluid may reflect abnormally high release or diminished enzymatic destruction of norepinephrine in patients with schizophrenia.
When natural scenes are viewed, a multitude of objects that are stable in their environments are brought in and out of view by eye movements. The posterior parietal cortex is crucial for the analysis of space, visual attention and movement. Neurons in one of its subdivisions, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), have visual responses to stimuli appearing abruptly at particular retinal locations (their receptive fields). We have tested the responses of LIP neurons to stimuli that entered their receptive field by saccades. Neurons had little or no response to stimuli brought into their receptive field by saccades, unless the stimuli were behaviourally significant. We established behavioural significance in two ways: either by making a stable stimulus task-relevant, or by taking advantage of the attentional attraction of an abruptly appearing stimulus. Our results show that under ordinary circumstances the entire visual world is only weakly represented in LIP. The visual representation in LIP is sparse, with only the most salient or behaviourally relevant objects being strongly represented.
A soluble extract of rat skeletal muscle increased neurite outgrowth and cholinergic activity of dissociated ventral spinal neurons in culture. The effects were concentration-dependent, saturable, and labile in the presence of heat or trypsin. The morphological enhancement was produced only by skeletal muscle extract and decreased with developmental age, whereas the cholinergic enhancement was produced by extracts of cerebral cortex and cardiac and skeletal muscle and did not change with age. These changes were specific for ventral cord neurons, but no species specificity was observed with respect to the muscle source or the neuronal target.
Stimulus-evoked oscillatory synchronization of neural assemblies and temporal patterns of neuronal activity have been observed in many sensory systems, such as the visual and auditory cortices of mammals or the olfactory system of insects. In the locust olfactory system, single odor puffs cause the immediate formation of odor-specific neural assemblies, defined both by their transient synchronized firing and their progressive transformation over the course of a response. The application of an antagonist of ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors to the first olfactory relay neuropil selectively blocked the fast inhibitory synapse between local and projection neurons. This manipulation abolished the synchronization of the odor-coding neural ensembles but did not affect each neuron's temporal response patterns to odors, even when these patterns contained periods of inhibition. Fast GABA-mediated inhibition, therefore, appears to underlie neuronal synchronization but not response tuning in this olfactory system. The selective desynchronization of stimulus-evoked oscillating neural assemblies in vivo is now possible, enabling direct functional tests of their significance for sensation and perception.
During normal vertebrate development, about half of spinal motoneurons are lost by a process of naturally occurring or programmed cell death. Additional developing motoneurons degenerate after the removal of targets or afferents. Naturally occurring motoneuron death as well as motoneuron death after loss of targets or after axotomy can be prevented by in vivo treatment with putative target (muscle) derived or other neurotrophic agents. Motoneurons can also be prevented from dying in vitro and in vivo (Y.Q.-W., R.W., D.P., J. Johnson and L. Van Eldik, unpublished data and refs 7, 13, 14) by treatment with central nervous system extracts (brain or spinal cord) and purified central nervous system and glia-derived proteins. Here we report that in vivo treatment of chick embryos with brain-derived neurotrophic factor rescues motoneurons from naturally occurring cell death. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (and nerve growth factor) also prevents the induced death of motoneurons that occurs following the removal of descending afferent input (deafferentation). These data indicate that members of the neurotrophin family can promote the survival of developing avian motoneurons.
Angiogenesis--the growth of new blood vessels--is a crucial force for shaping the nervous system and protecting it from disease. Recent advances have improved our understanding of how the brain and other tissues grow new blood vessels under normal and pathological conditions. Angiogenesis factors, especially vascular endothelial growth factor, are now known to have roles in the birth of new neurons (neurogenesis), the prevention or mitigation of neuronal injury (neuroprotection), and the pathogenesis of stroke, Alzheimer's disease and motor neuron disease. As our understanding of pathophysiology grows, these developments may point the way towards new molecular and cell-based therapies.
Songbirds learn a correspondence between vocal-motor output and auditory feedback during development. For neurons in a motor cortex analog of adult zebra finches, we show that the timing and structure of activity elicited by the playback of song during sleep matches activity during daytime singing. The motor activity leads syllables, and the matching sensory response depends on a sequence of typically up to three of the preceding syllables. Thus, sensorimotor correspondence is reflected in temporally precise activity patterns of single neurons that use long sensory memories to predict syllable sequences. Additionally, "spontaneous" activity of these neurons during sleep matches their sensorimotor activity, a form of song "replay." These data suggest a model whereby sensorimotor correspondences are stored during singing but do not modify behavior, and off-line comparison (e.g., during sleep) of rehearsed motor output and predicted sensory feedback is used to adaptively shape motor output.
Human recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) may benefit ischemic stroke patients by dissolving clots. However, independent of thrombolysis, tPA may also have deleterious effects on neurons by promoting excitotoxicity. Zinc neurotoxicity has been shown to be an additional key mechanism in brain injuries. Hence, if tPA affects zinc neurotoxicity, this may provide additional insights into its effect on neuronal death. Independent of its proteolytic action, tPA markedly attenuated zinc-induced cell death in cortical culture, and, when injected into cerebrospinal fluid, also reduced kainate seizure-induced hippocampal neuronal death in adult rats.
When two spatially intermingled sets of random dots move in different directions, the direction of each set may be misperceived. Observers report that each set of dots appears to move in a direction displaced by as much as 20 degrees from the direction of its companion set. Probably the result of inhibitory interactions, this mutual repulsion occurs at a central site in the visual system and may normally enhance discrimination of direction.
Humans, like other animals, alter their behavior depending on whether a threat is close or distant. We investigated spatial imminence of threat by developing an active avoidance paradigm in which volunteers were pursued through a maze by a virtual predator endowed with an ability to chase, capture, and inflict pain. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that as the virtual predator grew closer, brain activity shifted from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex to the periaqueductal gray. This shift showed maximal expression when a high degree of pain was anticipated. Moreover, imminence-driven periaqueductal gray activity correlated with increased subjective degree of dread and decreased confidence of escape. Our findings cast light on the neural dynamics of threat anticipation and have implications for the neurobiology of human anxiety-related disorders.
Genetic studies have shown that mutations within the mahogany locus suppress the pleiotropic phenotypes, including obesity, of the agouti-lethal-yellow mutant. Here we identify the mahogany gene and its product; this study, to our knowledge, represents the first positional cloning of a suppressor gene in the mouse. Expression of the mahogany gene is broad; however, in situ hybridization analysis emphasizes the importance of its expression in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, a region that is intimately involved in the regulation of body weight and feeding. We present new genetic studies that indicate that the mahogany locus does not suppress the obese phenotype of the melanocortin-4-receptor null allele or those of the monogenic obese models (Lep(db), tub and Cpe(fat)). However, mahogany can suppress diet-induced obesity, the mechanism of which is likely to have implications for therapeutic intervention in common human obesity. The amino-acid sequence of the mahogany protein suggests that it is a large, single-transmembrane-domain receptor-like molecule, with a short cytoplasmic tail containing a site that is conserved between Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. We propose two potential, alternative modes of action for mahogany: one draws parallels with the mechanism of action of low-affinity proteoglycan receptors such as fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta, and the other suggests that mahogany itself is a signalling receptor.
To analyze the rules that govern communication between eye and brain, visual responses were recorded from an intact salamander retina. Parallel observation of many retinal ganglion cells with a microelectrode array showed that nearby neurons often fired synchronously, with spike delays of less than 10 milliseconds. The frequency of such synchronous spikes exceeded the correlation expected from a shared visual stimulus up to 20-fold. Synchronous firing persisted under a variety of visual stimuli and accounted for the majority of action potentials recorded. Analysis of receptive fields showed that concerted spikes encoded information not carried by individual cells; they may represent symbols in a multineuronal code for vision.
The "staggerer" mutant is recognized by its staggering gait, mild tremor, hypotonia, and small size. Symptoms develop during postnatal weeks 1 to 4 and remain stationary thereafter. The cerebellar cortex is grossly underdeveloped, with too few granule cells and unaligned Purkinje cells. Genetic linkage studies and neuropathological findings distinguish staggerer from other known mutants.
Activity-independent and activity-dependent mechanisms work in concert to regulate neuronal growth, ensuring the formation of accurate synaptic connections. CPG15, a protein regulated by synaptic activity, functions as a cell-surface growth-promoting molecule in vivo. In Xenopus laevis, CPG15 enhanced dendritic arbor growth in projection neurons, with no effect on interneurons. CPG15 controlled growth of neighboring neurons through an intercellular signaling mechanism that requires its glycosylphosphatidylinositol link. CPG15 may represent a new class of activity-regulated, membrane-bound, growth-promoting proteins that permit exquisite spatial and temporal control of neuronal structure.
Differential spread of afterdischarge activity initiated electrically in ventral and dorsal parts of the hippocampal formation was studied by the [14C]deoxyglucose technique in rats. Afterdischarges initiated in either the ventral or dorsal hippocampal formation, without activation of the ventral subicular cortex, increased glucose utilization in the lateral septum. In contrast, afterdischarges initiated by direct activation of the ventral subicular cortex increased glucose utilization in extensive areas of the ipsilateral amygdala, claustrum, hypothalamus, preoptic region, and basal forebrain.
The concentration of the primary brain metabolite of norepinephrine is diminished in the lumbar spinal fluid of patients with Korsakoff's syndrome. The extent of its reduction is significantly correlated with measures of memory impairment for individual patients. These data suggest that the memory disorder of Korsakoff's syndrome may result from damage to ascending noradrenergic pathways by the diencephalic and brainstem lesions associated with this disease.
We have shown previously that chromosome VI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains nine origins of DNA replication that differ in initiation frequency and replicate sequentially during the S phase of the cell cycle. Here we show that there are links between activation of these multiple origins and regulation of S-phase progression. We study the effects of a DNA-damaging agent, methyl methane sulphonate (MMS), and of mutations in checkpoint genes such as rad53 on the activity of origins, measured by two-dimensional gel analysis, and on cell-cycle progression, measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We find that when MMS slows down S-phase progression it also selectively blocks initiation from late origins. A rad53 mutation enhances late and/or inefficient origins and releases the initiation block by MMS. Mutation of rad53 also results in a late origin becoming early replicating. We conclude that rad53 regulates the timing of initiation of replication from late origins during normal cell growth and blocks initiation from late origins in MMS-treated cells. rad53 is, therefore, involved in the cell's surveillance of S-phase progression. We also find that orc2, which encodes subunit 2 of the origin-recognition complex, is involved in suppression of late origins.
Many neurons receive a continuous, or 'tonic', synaptic input, which increases their membrane conductance, and so modifies the spatial and temporal integration of excitatory signals. In cerebellar granule cells, although the frequency of inhibitory synaptic currents is relatively low, the spillover of synaptically released GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) gives rise to a persistent conductance mediated by the GABA A receptor that also modifies the excitability of granule cells. Here we show that this tonic conductance is absent in granule cells that lack the alpha6 and delta-subunits of the GABAA receptor. The response of these granule cells to excitatory synaptic input remains unaltered, owing to an increase in a 'leak' conductance, which is present at rest, with properties characteristic of the two-pore-domain K+ channel TASK-1 (refs 9,10,11,12). Our results highlight the importance of tonic inhibition mediated by GABAA receptors, loss of which triggers a form of homeostatic plasticity leading to a change in the magnitude of a voltage-independent K + conductance that maintains normal neuronal behaviour.
In an infant rhesus monkey brain damage resulted from subcutaneously administered monosodium glutamate. Although a relatively high dose of monosodium glutamate was used, the infant was asymptomatic for a 3-hour observation period during which time hypothalamic neurons were undergoing a process of acute cell death. With the electron microscope it was observed that dendrites and cell bodies of neurons are the tissue components primarily affected in brain damage induced by monosodium glutamate.
Proteasomes, the primary mediators of ubiquitin-protein conjugate degradation, are regulated through complex and poorly understood mechanisms. Here we show that USP14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme, can inhibit the degradation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates both in vitro and in cells. A catalytically inactive variant of USP14 has reduced inhibitory activity, indicating that inhibition is mediated by trimming of the ubiquitin chain on the substrate. A high-throughput screen identified a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinating activity of human USP14. Treatment of cultured cells with this compound enhanced degradation of several proteasome substrates that have been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. USP14 inhibition accelerated the degradation of oxidized proteins and enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. Enhancement of proteasome activity through inhibition of USP14 may offer a strategy to reduce the levels of aberrant proteins in cells under proteotoxic stress.
The nucleus accumbens is a key mediator of cocaine reward, but the distinct roles of the two subpopulations of nucleus accumbens projection neurons, those expressing dopamine D1 versus D2 receptors, are poorly understood. We show that deletion of TrkB, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor, selectively from D1+ or D2+ neurons oppositely affects cocaine reward. Because loss of TrkB in D2+ neurons increases their neuronal excitability, we next used optogenetic tools to control selectively the firing rate of D1+ and D2+ nucleus accumbens neurons and studied consequent effects on cocaine reward. Activation of D2+ neurons, mimicking the loss of TrkB, suppresses cocaine reward, with opposite effects induced by activation of D1+ neurons. These results provide insight into the molecular control of D1+ and D2+ neuronal activity as well as the circuit-level contribution of these cell types to cocaine reward.
The mossy fibre pathway in the hippocampus uses glutamate as a neurotransmitter, but also contains the opioid peptide dynorphin. Synaptic release of dynorphin causes a presynaptic inhibition of neighbouring mossy fibres and inhibits the induction and expression of mossy fibre long-term potentiation. These findings demonstrate a physiological role for a neuropeptide in the central nervous system, provide a functional basis for the coexistence of a neuropeptide with classic neurotransmitters and demonstrate the very different roles played by these two classes of signalling molecules.
The Rab family of low-molecular-mass GTP-binding proteins are thought to guide membrane fusion between a transport vesicle and the target membrane, and to determine the specificity of docking. The docking and fusion of vesicles is, however, a complex multistep reaction, and the precise point at which Rab proteins act in these sequential processes is unknown. In brain, the Rab protein Rab3A is specific to synaptic vesicles, whose exocytosis can be monitored with submillisecond resolution by following synaptic transmission. We have now determined the precise point at which Rab3A acts in the sequence of synaptic vesicle docking and fusion by using electrophysiological analysis of neurotransmitter release in Rab3A-deficient mice. Unexpectedly, the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles is normal, whereas Ca2+-triggered fusion is altered in the absence of Rab3A in that a more-than-usual number of exocytic events occur within a brief time after arrival of the nerve impulse.
The fly Drosophila melanogaster can discriminate and remember visual landmarks. It analyses selected parts of its visual environment according to a small number of pattern parameters such as size, colour or contour orientation, and stores particular parameter values. Like humans, flies recognize patterns independently of the retinal position during acquisition of the pattern (translation invariance). Here we show that the central-most part of the fly brain, the fan-shaped body, contains parts of a network mediating visual pattern recognition. We have identified short-term memory traces of two pattern parameters--elevation in the panorama and contour orientation. These can be localized to two groups of neurons extending branches as parallel, horizontal strata in the fan-shaped body. The central location of this memory store is well suited to mediate translational invariance.
Dopamine is the principal catecholamine neurotransmitter in the vertebrate retina. The shape of retinal neurons that accumulate dopamine has been demonstrated in an in vitro preparation of cat retina. This was achieved by the discovery that the combined uptake of dopamine and the indoleaminergic transmitter analog 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine leads to an intense, catecholamine-like fluorescence in the cell bodies and processes of presumed dopaminergic amacrine cells in the living retina. This fluorescence served as an in vitro marker for these cells, and their detailed morphology was analyzed after intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase under direct microscopic control. The horseradish peroxidase-filled cells show an unprecedented neuronal morphology: each cell gives rise to multiple, axon-like processes that arise from, and extend for millimeters beyond, the dendritic tree. The unique structure of this type of amacrine cell suggests a function for dopamine in long-range lateral interactions in the inner plexiform layer.
Modulation of substance P activity offers a radical new approach to the management of depression, anxiety and stress. The substance P receptor is highly expressed in areas of the brain that are implicated in these behaviours, but also in other areas such as the nucleus accumbens which mediate the motivational properties of both natural rewards such as food and of drugs of abuse such as opiates. Here we show a loss of the rewarding properties of morphine in mice with a genetic disruption of the substance P receptor. The loss was specific to morphine, as both groups of mice responded when cocaine or food were used as rewards. The physical response to opiate withdrawal was also reduced in substance P receptor knockout mice. We conclude that substance P has an important and specific role in mediating the motivational aspects of opiates and may represent a new pharmacological route for the control of drug abuse.
The fat-derived hormone leptin regulates energy balance in part by modulating the activity of neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. To study the intrinsic activity of these neurons and their responses to leptin, we generated mice that express distinct green fluorescent proteins in these two neuronal types. Leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice differed from wild-type mice in the numbers of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and postsynaptic currents onto neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin neurons. When leptin was delivered systemically to ob/ob mice, the synaptic density rapidly normalized, an effect detectable within 6 hours, several hours before leptin's effect on food intake. These data suggest that leptin-mediated plasticity in the ob/ob hypothalamus may underlie some of the hormone's behavioral effects.
Sodium ion (Na+) channels, which initiate the action potential in electrically excitable cells, are the molecular targets of local anesthetic drugs. Site-directed mutations in transmembrane segment S6 of domain IV of the Na+ channel alpha subunit from rat brain selectively modified drug binding to resting or to open and inactivated channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Mutation F1764A, near the middle of this segment, decreased the affinity of open and inactivated channels to 1 percent of the wild-type value, resulting in almost complete abolition of both the use-dependence and voltage-dependence of drug block, whereas mutation N1769A increased the affinity of the resting channel 15-fold. Mutation I1760A created an access pathway for drug molecules to reach the receptor site from the extracellular side. The results define the location of the local anesthetic receptor site in the pore of the Na+ channel and identify molecular determinants of the state-dependent binding of local anesthetics.
Synaptic transmission involves the regulated exocytosis of vesicles filled with neurotransmitter. Classical transmitters are synthesized in the cytoplasm, and so must be transported into synaptic vesicles. Although the vesicular transporters for monoamines and acetylcholine have been identified, the proteins responsible for packaging the primary inhibitory and excitatory transmitters, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate remain unknown. Studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have implicated the gene unc-47 in the release of GABA. Here we show that the sequence of unc-47 predicts a protein with ten transmembrane domains, that the gene is expressed by GABA neurons, and that the protein colocalizes with synaptic vesicles. Further, a rat homologue of unc-47 is expressed by central GABA neurons and confers vesicular GABA transport in transfected cells with kinetics and substrate specificity similar to those previously reported for synaptic vesicles from the brain. Comparison of this vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) with a vesicular transporter for monoamines shows that there are differences in the bioenergetic dependence of transport, and these presumably account for the differences in structure. Thus VGAT is the first of a new family of neurotransmitter transporters.
The effects of neurotrophins on several forms of neuronal degeneration in murine cortical cell cultures were examined. Consistent with other studies, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4/5 all attenuated the apoptotic death induced by serum deprivation or exposure to the calcium channel antagonist nimodipine. Unexpectedly, however, 24-hour pretreatment with these same neurotrophins markedly potentiated the necrotic death induced by exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation or N-methyl-D-aspartate. Thus, certain neurotrophins may have opposing effects on different types of death in the same neurons.
The incubation of slices of cerebral cortex under hyperbaric oxygen pressures from 1 to 10 atmospheres in the presence of radioactive glucose, pyruvate, succinate, fumarate, L-glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid causes a marked diminution of tissue oxidative reactions. There is a simultaneous decrease in phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate, and a reduction of the apparent intracellular ionic gradients. The increase of lipid peroxides, measured directly, is attributed to the toxic effects of hyperbaric oxygen.
The Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a well-defined syndrome with facial abnormalities, broad thumbs, broad big toes and mental retardation as the main clinical features. Many patients with RTS have been shown to have breakpoints in, and microdeletions of, chromosome 16p13.3 (refs 4-8). Here we report that all these breakpoints are restricted to a region that contains the gene for the human CREB binding protein (CBP), a nuclear protein participating as a co-activator in cyclic-AMP-regulated gene expression. We show that RTS results not only from gross chromosomal rearrangements of chromosome 16p, but also from point mutations in the CBP gene itself. Because the patients are heterozygous for the mutations, we propose that the loss of one functional copy of the CBP gene underlies the developmental abnormalities in RTS and possibly the propensity for malignancy.
Although thousands of large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified in mammals, few have been functionally characterized, leading to debate about their biological role. To address this, we performed loss-of-function studies on most lincRNAs expressed in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and characterized the effects on gene expression. Here we show that knockdown of lincRNAs has major consequences on gene expression patterns, comparable to knockdown of well-known ES cell regulators. Notably, lincRNAs primarily affect gene expression in trans. Knockdown of dozens of lincRNAs causes either exit from the pluripotent state or upregulation of lineage commitment programs. We integrate lincRNAs into the molecular circuitry of ES cells and show that lincRNA genes are regulated by key transcription factors and that lincRNA transcripts bind to multiple chromatin regulatory proteins to affect shared gene expression programs. Together, the results demonstrate that lincRNAs have key roles in the circuitry controlling ES cell state.
A startlingly simple molecule unites neuroscience, physiology, and immunology, and revises scientists' understanding of how cells communicate and defend themselves.
The regulation of gene transcription involves a dynamic balance between packaging regulatory sequences into chromatin and allowing transcriptional regulators access to these sequences. Access is restricted by the nucleosomes, but these can be repositioned or ejected by enzymes known as nucleosome remodellers. In addition, the DNA sequence can impart stiffness or curvature to the DNA, thereby affecting the position of nucleosomes on the DNA, influencing particular promoter 'architectures'. Recent genome-wide studies in yeast suggest that constitutive and regulated genes have architectures that differ in terms of nucleosome position, turnover, remodelling requirements and transcriptional noise.
Follicle rupture during ovulation is associated with inflammation-like changes. Because platelet activating factor (PAF) participates in the inflammatory process, the effect of a PAF-specific antagonist, BN52021, on the ovulatory response was tested in rats. BN52021, administered locally, inhibited follicle rupture in rats stimulated to ovulate with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In addition to suppressing rupture of the follicles, this antagonist suppressed the hCG-stimulated increase in ovarian collagenolysis and vascular permeability. The inhibition of ovulation of BN52021 could be reversed by simultaneous administration of PAF. Furthermore, PAF partially reversed the blockage of ovulation by inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis. Collectively, these results suggest the involvement of PAF in ovulation. Its role seems to be closely related to the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Thus, modulation of PAF action may serve as an additional target for regulation of reproduction via its action on ovulation.
Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a hormone secreted from mammalian atria, regulates the homoeostatic balance of body fluid and blood pressure. ANP-like immunoreactivity is also present in the brain, suggesting that the peptide functions as a neuropeptide. We report here identification in porcine brain of a novel peptide of 26 amino-acid residues, eliciting a pharmacological spectrum very similar to that of ANP, such as natriuretic-diuretic, hypotensive and chick rectum relaxant activities. The complete amino-acid sequence determined for the peptide is remarkably similar to but definitely distinct from the known sequence of ANP, indicating that the genes for the two are distinct. Thus, we have designated the peptide 'brain natriuretic peptide' (BNP). The occurrence of BNP with ANP in mammalian brain suggests the possibility that the physiological functions so far thought to be mediated by ANP may be regulated through a dual mechanism involving both ANP and BNP.
In longitudal studies on psychiatric patients receiving therapeutic doses of reserpine and isocarboxazid, singly or in combination, we observed that the aggravation of psychotic symptoms sometimes occurring during treatment with reserpine was associated with a marked rise in urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Tranquilization was accompanied by a more moderate increase under the influence of reserpine, or by a reduction of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid excretion while on monoamineoxidase inhibitor medication. It is concluded that a moderate rise of free serotonin in the brain is associated with tranquilization, while a greater increase is accompanied by excitation.
The dopamine D4 receptor structurally and pharmacologically resembles the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic that is relatively free of the adverse effects of drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia, binds to the D4 receptor with an affinity 10 times higher than to the D2 and D3 receptors. This may explain clozapine's atypical properties. Here we report the existence of at least three polymorphic variations in the coding sequence of the human D4 receptor. A 48-base-pair sequence in the putative third cytoplasmic loop of this receptor exists either as a direct-repeat sequence (D4.2), as a fourfold repeat (D4.4) or as a sevenfold repeat (D4.7). Two more variant alleles were detected in humans. Expression of the complementary DNA for the three cloned receptor variants showed different properties for the long form (D4.7) and the shorter forms (D4.2, D4.4) with respect to clozapine and spiperone binding. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a receptor in the catecholamine receptor family that displays polymorphic variation in the human population. Such variation among humans may underlie individual differences in susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disease and in responsiveness to antipsychotic medication.
In addition to its well-established inhibitory effect on uric acid synthesis, allopurinol appears to alter substantially pyrimidine metabolism, as evidenced by a striking increase in the urinary excretion of orotidine and orotic acid. Allopurinol ribonucleotide and xanthosine 5'-monophosphate are potent inhibitors of human erythrocyte orotidylic decarboxylase and provide a possible mechanism for this effect.
Subdivisions of the human peri-Sylvian language cortex were derived from stimulation mapping during craniotomies under local anesthesia. Naming, reading, short-term verbal memory, single and sequential orofacial movements, and phoneme identification were tested. Sequential orofacial movements and phoneme identification were altered from the same brain sites and thus identified a common system for language production and understanding. This system surrounded a final motor pathway for speech and was surrounded by a separate short-term verbal-memory system. Between the sequential motor-phoneme identification and memory systems were sites where only naming or reading were altered, including sites related exclusively by syntax.
Neurotransmitter release is mediated by Ca2+ dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Neither the amount of transmitter released from individual synaptic vesicles nor the kinetics of this process have yet been directly determined. Using carbon fibres as electrochemical detectors, we have measured release of the neurotransmitter serotonin from cultured neurons of the leech. This technique allowed us to monitor transmitter discharge from single synaptic vesicles as spike-like oxidation currents at high time resolution, providing new insight into the mechanism of neuronal exocytosis. Two types of signals were characterized, corresponding to exocytosis of small clear and large dense core vesicles present in these cells. A small vesicle discharges about 4,700 transmitter molecules with a time constant in the region of 260 microseconds, whereas large vesicles release their content of approximately 80,000 molecules with a time constant of about 1.3 ms. Release from both vesicle types is initiated rapidly, with a rise time of less than 60 microseconds, suggesting an abrupt opening of a preassembled fusion pore.
Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in Japan (incidence is 0.7-1.2 per 10,000 births), is characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy associated with brain malformation (micropolygria) due to a defect in the migration of neurons. We previously mapped the FCMD gene to a region of less than 100 kilobases which included the marker locus D9S2107 on chromosome 9q31. We have also described a haplotype that is shared by more than 80% of FCMD chromosomes, indicating that most chromosomes bearing the FCMD mutation could be derived from a single ancestor. Here we report that there is a retrotransposal insertion of tandemly repeated sequences within this candidate-gene interval in all FCMD chromosomes carrying the founder haplotype (87%). The inserted sequence is about 3 kilobases long and is located in the 3' untranslated region of a gene encoding a new 461-amino-acid protein. This gene is expressed in various tissues in normal individuals, but not in FCMD patients who carry the insertion. Two independent point mutations confirm that mutation of this gene is responsible for FCMD. The predicted protein, which we term fukutin, contains an amino-terminal signal sequence, which together with results from transfection experiments suggests that fukutin is a secreted protein. To our knowledge, FCMD is the first human disease to be caused by an ancient retrotransposal integration.
Perceptual illusions are usually thought to arise from the way sensory signals are encoded by the brain, and indeed are often used to infer the mechanisms of sensory encoding. But perceptual illusions might also result from the way the brain decodes sensory information, reflecting the strategies that optimize performance in particular tasks. In a fine discrimination task, the most accurate information comes from neurons tuned away from the discrimination boundary, and observers seem to use signals from these 'displaced' neurons to optimize their performance. We wondered whether using signals from these neurons might also bias perception. In a fine direction discrimination task using moving random-dot stimuli, we found that observers' perception of the direction of motion is indeed biased away from the boundary. This misperception can be accurately described by a decoding model that preferentially weights signals from neurons whose responses best discriminate those directions. In a coarse discrimination task, to which a different decoding rule applies, the same stimulus is not misperceived, suggesting that the illusion is a direct consequence of the decoding strategy that observers use to make fine perceptual judgments. The subjective experience of motion is therefore not mediated directly by the responses of sensory neurons, but is only developed after the responses of these neurons are decoded.
The phenomenon of long-term potentiation (LTP), a long lasting increase in the strength of synaptic transmission which is due to brief, repetitive activation of excitatory afferent fibres, is one of the most striking examples of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the induction of LTP requires activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors by synaptically released glutamate with concomitant postsynaptic membrane depolarization. This relieves the voltage-dependent magnesium block of the NMDA-receptor ion channel, allowing calcium to flow into the dendritic spine. Although calcium has been shown to be a necessary trigger for LTP (refs 11, 12), little is known about the immediate biochemical processes that are activated by calcium and are responsible for LTP. The most attractive candidates have been calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) (refs 13-16), protein kinase C (refs 17-19), and the calcium-dependent protease, calpain. Extracellular application of protein kinase inhibitors to the hippocampal slice preparation blocks the induction of LTP (refs 21-23) but it is unclear whether this is due to a pre- and/or postsynaptic action. We have found that intracellular injection into CA1 pyramidal cells of the protein kinase inhibitor H-7, or of the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium, blocks LTP. Furthermore, LTP is blocked by the injection of synthetic peptides that are potent calmodulin antagonists and inhibit CaM-KII auto- and substrate phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that in the postsynaptic cell both activation of calmodulin and kinase activity are required for the generation of LTP, and focus further attention on the potential role of CaM-KII in LTP.
Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins can be conditionally activated in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and interferon (IFN)-gamma. STAT activation was correlated with cell growth inhibition in response to EGF and IFN-gamma. Activated STAT proteins specifically recognized the conserved STAT-responsive elements in the promoter of the gene encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 WAF1/CIP1 and regulated the induction of p21 messenger RNA. IFN-gamma did not inhibit the growth of U3A cells, which are deficient in STAT1, but did inhibit the growth of U3A cells into which STAT1 alpha was reintroduced. Thus, STAT1 protein is essential for cell growth suppression in response to IFN-gamma. The STAT signaling pathway appears to negatively regulate the cell cycle by inducing CDK inhibitors in response to cytokines.
Formation of myelinated tracts in central nervous system (CNS) regions such as the optic nerve seems to depend on two glial cell types, both of which derive from a common progenitor cell. This oligodendrocyte--type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cell gives rise to oligodendrocytes, which produce internodal myelin sheaths, and to type-2 astrocytes, which extend fine processes in the region of the nodal axolemma. The optic nerve also contains a third glial cell, the type-1 astrocyte, which derives from a separate precursor. These three glial cells develop in a fixed sequence over a two-week period: type-1 astrocytes appear at embryonic day 16 (E16), oligodendrocytes at the day of birth (E21 or postnatal day P0), and type-2 astrocytes between P8 and P10. Type-1 astrocytes secrete a potent mitogen which causes expansion of the O-2A progenitor cell population in vitro. Here, we report that dividing O-2A progenitor cells are highly motile and seem to migrate from the brain into the optic nerve, beginning at its chiasmal end. Our results indicate that long-distance migration along the neural axis is characteristic only of progenitors of the O-2A lineage and may serve to distribute these cells to regions of the CNS that will become myelinated. These results also suggest that the intrinsic neuroepithelial cells of the optic stalk may be even more restricted than previously thought, giving rise only to type-1 astrocytes.
Dense, focal injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated-horseradish peroxidase in the locus coeruleus of rats labeled afferent neurons in unexpectedly few brain regions. Major inputs emanate from only two nuclei--the paragigantocellularis and the prepositus hypoglossi, both in the rostral medulla. The dorsal cap of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and the spinal intermediate gray are possible minor afferents to locus coeruleus. Other areas reported to project to locus coeruleus (for example, amygdala, nucleus tractus solitarius, and spinal dorsal horn) did not exhibit consistent retrograde labeling. Anterograde tracing and electrophysiologic experiments confirmed the absence of input to locus coeruleus from these areas, which instead terminate in targets adjacent to locus coeruleus. These findings redefine the anatomic organization of the locus coeruleus, and have implications for hypotheses concerning the functions of this noradrenergic brain nucleus.
Refractory periods were estimated for fibers of the hypothalamic substrate of brain stimulation reward. Two nonoverlapping populations were evident: a homogeneous fast population and a more heterogeneous slow population. Cholinergic blockade eliminated the contribution of the fast but not the slow fibers, while dopaminergic blockade reduced responding without significantly influencing either directly activated fiber population. These data indicate that the hypothalamic reward substrate is more complex than has been widely appreciated; it contains two or more parallel subsystems, and one of these subsystems has a cholinergic link.
Serotonin is implicated in mood regulation, and drugs acting via the serotonergic system are effective in treating anxiety and depression. Specifically, agonists of the serotonin1A receptor have anxiolytic properties, and knockout mice lacking this receptor show increased anxiety-like behaviour. Here we use a tissue-specific, conditional rescue strategy to show that expression of the serotonin1A receptor primarily in the hippocampus and cortex, but not in the raphe nuclei, is sufficient to rescue the behavioural phenotype of the knockout mice. Furthermore, using the conditional nature of these transgenic mice, we suggest that receptor expression during the early postnatal period, but not in the adult, is necessary for this behavioural rescue. These findings show that postnatal developmental processes help to establish adult anxiety-like behaviour. In addition, the normal role of the serotonin1A receptor during development may be different from its function when this receptor is activated by therapeutic intervention in adulthood.
Class switch recombination (CSR) at the antibody immunoglobulin locus is regulated by germline transcription (GLT)-coupled modifications in the accessibility of the switch region, where CSR takes place. Here we show that histone acetylation of switch regions is linked to CSR but that histone acetylation cannot alone promote CSR or GLT. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) specifically associates with the CSR target chromatin in a GLT-coupled manner, which may occur potentially by means of physical interaction between AID and the transcription machinery. These data indicate an important role of GLT in the regulation of chromatin accessibility, strongly suggesting that the target of AID is chromatin DNA. Our results give insights on the role of AID and the regulatory mechanism of CSR.
Synaptic transmission is commonly terminated by diffusion and reuptake of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft. Glutamate reuptake prevents neurotoxicity and sets the lower limit for the concentration of extracellular glutamate, so it is important to understand the thermodynamics of this process. Here we use voltage clamping with a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye to monitor electrical currents and pH changes associated with flux of glutamate mediated by the human neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3. In contrast to a previous model, we find that three sodium ions and one proton are cotransported with each glutamate ion into the cell, while one potassium ion is transported out of the cell. This coupling can support a transmembrane glutamate concentration gradient ([Glu]in/[Glu]out) exceeding 10(6) under equilibrium conditions, and would allow the transporter to continue removing glutamate over a wide range of ionic conditions.
Salmonella typhimurium lacking DNA adenine methylase (Dam) were fully proficient in colonization of mucosal sites but showed severe defects in colonization of deeper tissue sites. These Dam- mutants were totally avirulent and were effective as live vaccines against murine typhoid fever. Dam regulated the expression of at least 20 genes known to be induced during infection; a subset of these genes are among those activated by the PhoP global virulence regulator. PhoP, in turn, affected Dam methylation at specific genomic sites, as evidenced by alterations in DNA methylation patterns. Dam inhibitors are likely to have broad antimicrobial action, and Dam- derivatives of these pathogens may serve as live attenuated vaccines.
Rats with electrolytic lesions in the septal forebrain show increased sleeping times after injection with thiopental sodium or barbital, as compared with normal and other control rats and rats with lesions in the cerebral cortex or caudate nucleus.
Event-related potentials of the brain are enhanced when stimulation is synchronized with diastolic phases of cerebral or cephalic pulse pressure waves. A cerebral vascular event has been found to be temporally consistent with the event-related potential. Averaged evoked vascular responses were measured with bioimpedance techniques from the brain and the arm. Changes in brain blood volume occurred 150 to 250 milliseconds after stimulation synchronized with diastolic but not systolic phases of the cerebral pulse pressure wave. The time course of this phenomenon defies the usually accepted characteristics of metabolic activity. The evoked vascular response may be a neurally mediated event in anticipation of altered metabolic demand, and it offers the possibility of measurement in real time.
Various chronic antidepressant treatments increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis, but the functional importance of this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, using genetic and radiological methods, we show that disrupting antidepressant-induced neurogenesis blocks behavioral responses to antidepressants. Serotonin 1A receptor null mice were insensitive to the neurogenic and behavioral effects of fluoxetine, a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor. X-irradiation of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus prevented the neurogenic and behavioral effects of two classes of antidepressants. These findings suggest that the behavioral effects of chronic antidepressants may be mediated by the stimulation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
In the vast majority of brain areas, the firing rates of neurons, averaged over several hundred milliseconds to several seconds, can be strongly modulated by, and provide accurate information about, properties of their inputs. This is referred to as the rate code. However, the biophysical laws of synaptic plasticity require precise timing of spikes over short timescales (<10 ms). Hence it is critical to understand the physiological mechanisms that can generate precise spike timing in vivo, and the relationship between such a temporal code and a rate code. Here we propose a mechanism by which a temporal code can be generated through an interaction between an asymmetric rate code and oscillatory inhibition. Consistent with the predictions of our model, the rate and temporal codes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons are highly correlated. Furthermore, the temporal code becomes more robust with experience. The resulting spike timing satisfies the temporal order constraints of hebbian learning. Thus, oscillations and receptive field asymmetry may have a critical role in temporal sequence learning.
Mutations in MeCP2, which encodes a protein that has been proposed to function as a global transcriptional repressor, are the cause of Rett syndrome (RT T), an X-linked progressive neurological disorder. Although the selective inactivation of MeCP2 in neurons is sufficient to confer a Rett-like phenotype in mice, the specific functions of MeCP2 in postmitotic neurons are not known. We find that MeCP2 binds selectively to BDNF promoter III and functions to repress expression of the BDNF gene. Membrane depolarization triggers the calcium-dependent phosphorylation and release of MeCP2 from BDNF promoter III, thereby facilitating transcription. These studies indicate that MeCP2 plays a key role in the control of neuronal activity-dependent gene regulation and suggest that the deregulation of this process may underlie the pathology of RT T.
Why sex prevails in nature remains one of the great puzzles of evolution. Sexual reproduction has an immediate cost relative to asexual reproduction, as males only express their contribution to population growth through females. With no males to sustain, an asexual mutant can double its relative representation in the population in successive generations. This is the widely accepted 'twofold cost of males'. Many studies have attempted to explain how sex can recoup this cost from fitness benefits associated with the recombination of parental genotypes, but these require complex biological environments that cycle over evolutionary timescales. In contrast, we have considered the ecological dynamics that govern asexual invasion. Here we show the existence of a threshold growth rate for the sexual population, above which the invasion is halted by intraspecific competition. The asexual population then exerts a weaker inhibitory effect on the carrying capacity of the sexual population than on its own carrying capacity. The stable outcome of this is coexistence on a depleted resource base. Under these ecological circumstances, longer-term benefits of sex may eventually drive out the asexual competitor.
Loss of brain serotonin was associated with overeating and increased body weight. Rats injected with p-chlorophenylalanine intraventricularly began overeating after 3 days and continued to display marked hyperphagia, primarily in the daytime, accompanied by increased body weight for 1 to 2 weeks. The effect was related to drug dose and to the degree and duration of serotonin depletion. Norepinephrine and dopamine levels were not significantly affected. It is concluded that p-chlorophenylalanine disinhibits feeding, as it does a number of other behaviors, by depleting serotonin. This suggests that hypothalamic lesions or dietary deficiencies which selectively and sufficiently deplete serotonin would lead to overeating.
X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy's disease) is an adult-onset form of motorneuron disease which may be associated with signs of androgen insensitivity. We have now investigated whether the androgen receptor gene on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome is a candidate gene for this disease. In patient samples we found androgen receptor gene mutations with increased size of a polymorphic tandem CAG repeat in the coding region. These amplified repeats were absolutely associated with the disease, being present in 35 unrelated patients and none of 75 controls. They segregated with the disease in 15 families, with no recombination in 61 meioses (the maximum log likelihood ratio (lod score) is 13.2 at a recombination rate of 0). The association is unlikely to be due to linkage disequilibrium, because 11 different disease alleles were observed. We conclude that enlargement of the CAG repeat in the androgen receptor gene is probably the cause of this disorder.
The adrenaline-forming enzyme (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) was elevated in the A1 and A2 regions of the brainstem of 4-week-old spontaneously (genetic) hypertensive rats and in the A1 region of adult experimentally (deoxycorticosterone acetate and sodium chloride) hypertensive rats. The administration of a phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor to experimentally hypertensive animals caused a reduction of the elevated blood pressure to normal values. These results implicate adrenaline-containing neurons in the brainstem in the development of hypertension.
In cats, significant loss of glycine occurred in spinal grey matter on the side of local tetanus, whereas the gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration remained unaltered. These findings suggest that tetanus rigidity is due to the blocking of the spinal inhibitory transmission by decrease of inhibitory transmitter and that glycine is an effective inhibitory transmitter in cat spinal cord.
The mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity have been largely inferred from electrophysiological studies performed at sites remote from synaptic terminals. Thus the mechanisms involved in plasticity at the secretory sites have remained ill-defined. We have now used somatic synapses of cultured Helisoma neurones to directly assess presynaptic ion conductances and study the secretory apparatus. At these synapses we determined the actions of a modulatory neuropeptide, Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (FMRFa), on the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Using voltage- and calcium-clamp techniques, we have demonstrated that FMRFa causes a presynaptic inhibition of ACh release by (1) reducing the magnitude of the voltage-dependent calcium current, and (2) regulating the secretory apparatus. The photolabile calcium cage, nitr-5 (refs 3-8), was dialysed into the presynaptic cell. In response to ultraviolet light, calcium was released from nitr-5 and ACh secretion was stimulated. Under conditions of constant internal calcium, FMRFa reduced the rate of ACh release. Thus we conclude that FMRFa reduces the influx of calcium during the action potential and decreases the sensitivity of the secretory apparatus to elevated internal calcium, thereby contributing to a presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release.
Behavioural studies widely implicate sleep in memory consolidation in the learning of a broad range of behaviours. During sleep, brain regions are reactivated, and specific patterns of neural activity are replayed, consistent with patterns observed in previous waking behaviour. Birdsong learning is a paradigmatic model system for skill learning. Song development in juvenile zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) is characterized by sleep-dependent circadian fluctuations in singing behaviour, with immediate post-sleep deterioration in song structure followed by recovery later in the day. In sleeping adult birds, spontaneous bursting activity of forebrain premotor neurons in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) carries information about daytime singing. Here we show that, in juvenile zebra finches, playback during the day of an adult 'tutor' song induced profound and tutor-song-specific changes in bursting activity of RA neurons during the following night of sleep. The night-time neuronal changes preceded tutor-song-induced changes in singing, first observed the following day. Interruption of auditory feedback greatly reduced sleep bursting and prevented the tutor-song-specific neuronal remodelling. Thus, night-time neuronal activity is shaped by the interaction of the song model (sensory template) and auditory feedback, with changes in night-time activity preceding the onset of practice associated with vocal learning. We hypothesize that night-time bursting induces adaptive changes in premotor networks during sleep as part of vocal learning. By this hypothesis, adaptive changes driven by replay of sensory information at night and by evaluation of sensory feedback during the day interact to produce the complex circadian patterns seen early in vocal development.
The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a serine-threonine kinase that regulates cell-cycle progression and growth by sensing changes in energy status. We demonstrated that mTOR signaling plays a role in the brain mechanisms that respond to nutrient availability, regulating energy balance. In the rat, mTOR signaling is controlled by energy status in specific regions of the hypothalamus and colocalizes with neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Central administration of leucine increases hypothalamic mTOR signaling and decreases food intake and body weight. The hormone leptin increases hypothalamic mTOR activity, and the inhibition of mTOR signaling blunts leptin's anorectic effect. Thus, mTOR is a cellular fuel sensor whose hypothalamic activity is directly tied to the regulation of energy intake.
A common single-nucleotide polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, a methionine (Met) substitution for valine (Val) at codon 66 (Val66Met), is associated with alterations in brain anatomy and memory, but its relevance to clinical disorders is unclear. We generated a variant BDNF mouse (BDNF(Met/Met)) that reproduces the phenotypic hallmarks in humans with the variant allele. BDNF(Met) was expressed in brain at normal levels, but its secretion from neurons was defective. When placed in stressful settings, BDNF(Met/Met) mice exhibited increased anxiety-related behaviors that were not normalized by the antidepressant, fluoxetine. A variant BDNF may thus play a key role in genetic predispositions to anxiety and depressive disorders.
A type of excitatory synaptic transmission which is novel for the vertebrate brain has been found in the ner neuron (M-cell) by means of the passive spread of their action currents across the synaptic membrane. After stimulating the ipsilateral eighth cranial nerve, an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) appears in the M-cell with a latency which is very brief ( about 0.1 msec) and which proba; bly represents a negligible synaptic delay. This response is attributed to the club endings: there were steep gradients of potential along the lateral dendrite of the M-cell during activity and the early EPSP was maximal in the distal part of the dendrite where the club endings predominate. Potential changes in the M-cell spread (passively) backwards into certain eighth-nerve fibers (probably club endings) indicating the presence of special low-resistance connections between them and the M-cell.
Functional receptive fields of neurons in sensory cortices undergo progressive refinement during development. Such refinement may be attributed to the pruning of non-optimal excitatory inputs, reshaping of the excitatory tuning profile through modifying the strengths of individual inputs, or strengthening of cortical inhibition. These models have not been directly tested because of the technical difficulties in assaying the spatiotemporal patterns of functional synaptic inputs during development. Here we apply in vivo whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to the recipient layer 4 neurons in the rat primary auditory cortex (A1) to determine the developmental changes in the frequency-intensity tonal receptive fields (TRFs) of their excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Surprisingly, we observe co-tuned excitation and inhibition immediately after the onset of hearing, suggesting that a tripartite thalamocortical circuit with relatively strong feedforward inhibition is formed independently of auditory experience. The frequency ranges of tone-driven excitatory and inhibitory inputs first expand within a few days of the onset of hearing and then persist into adulthood. The latter phase is accompanied by a sharpening of the excitatory but not inhibitory frequency tuning profile, which results in relatively broader inhibitory tuning in adult A1 neurons. Thus the development of cortical synaptic TRFs after the onset of hearing is marked by a slight breakdown of previously formed excitation-inhibition balance. Our results suggest that functional refinement of cortical TRFs does not require a selective pruning of inputs, but may depend more on a fine adjustment of excitatory input strengths.
Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) selectively bind to distinct members of the Trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors, but all three bind with similar affinities to the neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR). The biological significance of neurotrophin binding to p75NTR in cells that also express Trk receptors has been difficult to ascertain. In the absence of TrkA, NGF binding to p75NGR activated the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) in rat Schwann cells. This activation was not observed in Schwann cells isolated from mice that lacked p75NTR. The effect was selective for NGF; NF-kappa B was not activated by BDNF or NT-3.
Synaptic receptors respond to neurotransmitters by opening an intrinsic ion channel in the final step in synaptic transmission. How binding of the neurotransmitter is conveyed over the long distance to the channel remains a central question in neurobiology. Here we delineate a principal pathway that links neurotransmitter binding to channel gating by using a structural model of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor at 4-A resolution, recordings of currents through single receptor channels and determinations of energetic coupling between pairs of residues. We show that a pair of invariant arginine and glutamate residues in each receptor alpha-subunit electrostatically links peripheral and inner beta-sheets from the binding domain and positions them to engage with the channel. The key glutamate and flanking valine residues energetically couple to conserved proline and serine residues emerging from the top of the channel-forming alpha-helix, suggesting that this is the point at which the binding domain triggers opening of the channel. The series of interresidue couplings identified here constitutes a primary allosteric pathway that links neurotransmitter binding to channel gating.
The accumulation in brain of senile plaques containing beta-amyloid protein (A beta) is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid precursor protein (APP)4 from which A beta is derived is subject to several genetic mutations which segregate with rare familial forms of the disease, resulting in early onset of dementia and plaque formation, suggesting that APP metabolism plays a causal role in the disease. Various cell types have been shown to release a soluble form of A beta, thus allowing for the in vitro study of A beta generation. We report here evidence that a substantial portion of the APP secreted by human mixed brain cell cultures, as well as that present in cerebrospinal fluid, is of a novel form cleaved precisely at the amino terminus of A beta, suggesting that a secretory pathway is involved in A beta genesis.
A rabbit antiserum to a peptide sequence present in the precursor for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (proTRH), deduced from cloned amphibian-skin complementary DNA, was raised by immunization with the synthetic decapeptide Cys-Lys-Arg-Gln-His-Pro-Gly-Lys-Arg-Cys (proTRH-SH). Immunohistochemical studies on rat brain tissue showed staining of neuronal perikarya in the parvicellular division of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the raphe complex of the medulla, identical to that already described for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Immunostaining was abolished by preincubation with proTRH-SH (10(-6)M) but not TRH (10(-5)M). Both TRH precursor and TRH were located in neurons of the paraventricular nucleus. However, in contrast to the findings for TRH, no staining was observed in axon terminals of the median eminence. These results suggest that a TRH precursor analogous to that reported in frog skin is present in the rat brain and that TRH in the mammalian central nervous system is a product of ribosomal biosynthesis.
Of the vertebrate senses, touch is the least understood at the molecular level The ion channels that form the core of the mechanosensory complex and confer touch sensitivity remain unknown. However, the similarity of the brain sodium channel 1 (BNC1) to nematode proteins involved in mechanotransduction indicated that it might be a part of such a mechanosensor. Here we show that disrupting the mouse BNC1 gene markedly reduces the sensitivity of a specific component of mechanosensation: low-threshold rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors. In rodent hairy skin these mechanoreceptors are excited by hair movement. Consistent with this function, we found BNC1 in the lanceolate nerve endings that lie adjacent to and surround the hair follicle. Although BNC1 has been proposed to have a role in pH sensing, the acid-evoked current in cultured sensory neurons and the response of acid-stimulated nociceptors were normal in BNC1 null mice. These data identify the BNC1 channel as essential for the normal detection of light touch and indicate that BNC1 may be a central component of a mechanosensory complex.
How a cell chooses to proliferate or to differentiate is an important issue in stem cell and cancer biology. Drosophila neuroblasts undergo self-renewal with every cell division, producing another neuroblast and a differentiating daughter cell, but the mechanisms controlling the self-renewal/differentiation decision are poorly understood. Here we tested whether cell polarity genes, known to regulate embryonic neuroblast asymmetric cell division, also regulate neuroblast self-renewal. Clonal analysis in larval brains showed that pins mutant neuroblasts rapidly fail to self-renew, whereas lethal giant larvae (lgl) mutant neuroblasts generate multiple neuroblasts. Notably, lgl pins double mutant neuroblasts all divide symmetrically to self-renew, filling the brain with neuroblasts at the expense of neurons. The lgl pins neuroblasts show ectopic cortical localization of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and a decrease in aPKC expression reduces neuroblast numbers, suggesting that aPKC promotes neuroblast self-renewal. In support of this hypothesis, neuroblast-specific overexpression of membrane-targeted aPKC, but not a kinase-dead version, induces ectopic neuroblast self-renewal. We conclude that cortical aPKC kinase activity is a potent inducer of neuroblast self-renewal.
Mitochondria continuously undergo two opposing processes, fission and fusion. The disruption of this dynamic equilibrium may herald cell injury or death and may contribute to developmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Nitric oxide functions as a signaling molecule, but in excess it mediates neuronal injury, in part via mitochondrial fission or fragmentation. However, the underlying mechanism for nitric oxide-induced pathological fission remains unclear. We found that nitric oxide produced in response to beta-amyloid protein, thought to be a key mediator of Alzheimer's disease, triggered mitochondrial fission, synaptic loss, and neuronal damage, in part via S-nitrosylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (forming SNO-Drp1). Preventing nitrosylation of Drp1 by cysteine mutation abrogated these neurotoxic events. SNO-Drp1 is increased in brains of human Alzheimer's disease patients and may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration.
Human lung adenocarcinomas with activating mutations in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) often respond to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but the magnitude of tumour regression is variable and transient. This heterogeneity in treatment response could result from genetic modifiers that regulate the degree to which tumour cells are dependent on mutant EGFR. Through a pooled RNA interference screen, we show that knockdown of FAS and several components of the NF-kB pathway specifically enhanced cell death induced by the EGFR TKI erlotinib in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. Activation of NF-kB through overexpression of c-FLIP or IKK (also known as CFLAR and IKBKB, respectively), or silencing of IkB (also known as NFKBIA), rescued EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells from EGFR TKI treatment. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of NF-kB enhanced erlotinib-induced apoptosis in erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant lung cancer models. Increased expression of the NF-kB inhibitor IkB predicted for improved response and survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients treated with EGFR TKI. These data identify NF-kB as a potential companion drug target, together with EGFR, in EGFR-mutant lung cancers and provide insight into the mechanisms by which tumour cells escape from oncogene dependence.
In mast cells and granulocytes, exocytosis starts with the formation of a fusion pore. It has been suggested that neurotransmitters may be released through such a narrow pore without full fusion. However, owing to the small size of the secretory vesicles containing neurotransmitter, the properties of the fusion pore formed during Ca2+-dependent exocytosis and its role in transmitter release are still unknown. Here we investigate exocytosis of individual chromaffin granules by using cell-attached capacitance measurements combined with electrochemical detection of catecholamines, achieved by inserting a carbon-fibre electrode into the patch pipette. This allows the simultaneous determination of the opening of individual fusion pores and of the kinetics of catecholamine release from the same vesicle. We found that the fusion-pore diameter stays at <3 nm for a variable period, which can last for several seconds, before it expands. Transmitter is released much faster through this pore than in mast cells, generating a 'foot' signals which precedes the amperometric spike. Occasionally, the narrow pore forms only transiently and does not expand, allowing complete transmitter release without full fusion of the vesicle with the plasma membrane.
A synthetic peptidemimetic substrate of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease with a nonhydrolyzable pseudodipeptidyl insert at the protease cleavage site was prepared. The peptide U-81749 inhibited recombinant HIV-1 protease in vitro (inhibition constant Ki of 70 nanomolar) and HIV-1 replication in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (inhibitory concentration IC50 of 0.1 to 1 micromolar). Moreover, 10 micromolar concentrations of U-81749 significantly inhibited proteolysis of the HIV-1 gag polyprotein (p55) to the mature viral structural proteins p24 and p17 in cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HIV-1 gag-pol genes. The HIV-1 like particles released from inhibitor-treated cells contained almost exclusively p55 and other gag precursors, but not p24. Incubation of HIV-like particles recovered from drug-treated cultures in drug-free medium indicated that inhibition of p55 proteolysis was at least partially reversible, suggesting that U-81749 was present within the particles.
Abnormally high spiking activity can damage neurons. Signaling systems to protect neurons from the consequences of abnormal discharge activity have been postulated. We generated conditional mutant mice that lack expression of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 in principal forebrain neurons but not in adjacent inhibitory interneurons. In mutant mice,the excitotoxin kainic acid (KA) induced excessive seizures in vivo. The threshold to KA-induced neuronal excitation in vitro was severely reduced in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of mutants. KA administration rapidly raised hippocampal levels of anandamide and induced protective mechanisms in wild-type principal hippocampal neurons. These protective mechanisms could not be triggered in mutant mice. The endogenous cannabinoid system thus provides on-demand protection against acute excitotoxicity in central nervous system neurons.
Concentrations of butylated hydroxyanisole as low as 8 x 10(-9) mole per liter can inhibit detectably the contraction of smooth muscle elicited by bradykinin. The mechanism of the inhibitory effect of this food grade anti-oxidant is apparently complex, and the effect is only partially reversible.
A nuclear protein, CREB, has been isolated from rat brain and shown to stimulate transcription of the cyclic AMP-responsive gene somatostatin as a dimer. Biochemical analysis suggests that dimerization and transcriptional efficacy of CREB protein in vitro are regulated by phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that cellular signals can modulate gene expression by regulating the covalent modification of pre-existing nuclear factors.
The isocitrate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli is an example of a ubiquitous class of enzymes that are regulated by covalent modification. In the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme-substrate complex, isocitrate forms a hydrogen bond with Ser113, the site of regulatory phosphorylation. The structures of Asp113 and Glu113 mutants, which mimic the inactivation of the enzyme by phosphorylation, show minimal conformational changes from wild type, as in the phosphorylated enzyme. Calculations based on observed structures suggest that the change in electrostatic potential when a negative charge is introduced either by phosporylation or site-directed mutagenesis is sufficient to inactivate the enzyme. Thus, direct interaction at a ligand binding site is an alternative mechanism to induced conformational changes from an allosteric site in the regulation of protein activity by phosphorylation.
Functional nicotinic cholinergic receptors are found on mammalian retinal ganglion cell neurons in culture. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) can be detected in the medium of many of these retinal cultures, after release presumably from the choline acetyltransferase-positive amacrine cells. The postsynaptic effect of endogenous or applied ACh on the ganglion cells can be blocked with specific nicotinic antagonists. Here it is shown that within 24 hours of producing such a pharmacologic blockade, the retinal ganglion cells begin to sprout or regenerate neuronal processes. Thus, the growth-enhancing effect of nicotinic antagonists may be due to the removal of inhibition to growth by tonic levels of ACh present in the culture medium. Since there is a spontaneous leak of ACh in the intact retina, the effects of nicotinic cholinergic drugs on process outgrowth in culture may reflect a normal control mechanism for growth or regeneration of retinal ganglion cell processes that is exerted by ACh in vivo.
The stimulation of mating behavior by means of the stereotaxic introduction of small implants of solid C(14)-diethylstilbestrol di-n-butyrate to the hypothalamus of ovariectomized cats is described. Autoradiographic examination of the brains of mating animals reveals that certain neurons in the region of these implants show a selective affinity for labeled estrogen.
Natriuretic peptides inhibit the release and action of many hormones through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), but the mechanism of cGMP action is unclear. In frog ventricular muscle and guinea-pig hippocampal neurons, cGMP inhibits voltage-activated Ca2+ currents by stimulating phosphodiesterase activity and reducing intracellular cyclic AMP; however, this mechanism is not involved in the action of cGMP on other channels or on Ca2+ channels in other cells. Natriuretic peptide receptors in the rat pituitary also stimulate guanylyl cyclase activity but inhibit secretion by increasing membrane conductance to potassium. In an electrophysiological study on rat pituitary tumour cells, we identified the large-conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels (BK) as the primary target of another inhibitory neuropeptide, somatostatin. Here we report that atrial natriuretic peptide also stimulates BK channel activity in GH4C1 cells through protein dephosphorylation. Unlike somatostatin, however, the effect of atrial natriuretic peptide on BK channel activity is preceded by a rapid and potent stimulation of cGMP production and requires cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Protein phosphatase activation by cGMP-dependent kinase could explain the inhibitory effects of natriuretic peptides on electrical excitability and the antagonism of cGMP and cAMP in many systems.
Intracellular recordings from pairs of neurons in slices of rat hippocampus directly demonstrated electronic coupling between CA3 pyramidal cells. When two neurons were impaled simultaneously (as verified by subsequent double staining with horseradish peroxidase), current pulses injected into one cell caused voltage changes in other cells. These interactions were bidirectional. Fast prepotentials, historically thought to represent spike activity in dendrites, resulted from action potentials in other electronically coupled pyramidal cells. These data directly demonstrate electrotonic coupling between neurons in the mammalian brain and indicate that some fast prepotentials are coupling potentials. Coupling between pyramidal cells could mediate synchronization of normal rhythmic activity and of burst discharges during seizures.
Lesions in the medial preoptic area of ovariectomized female rats reduced the quantity of estrogen needed to induce sexual receptivity in these animals. In addition, the number of days over which receptive behavior could be elicited after a single initial estrogen injection and with subsequent daily progesterone treatment was significantly increased by lesions in the medial preoptic area. These findings support the view that estrogen acts to reduce an inhibitory action that is tonically exerted by the medial preoptic area on pathways mediating estrous behavior.
G proteins are an important class of regulatory switches in all living systems. They are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP. This activity makes GEFs attractive targets for modulating disease-relevant G-protein-controlled signalling networks. GEF inhibitors are therefore of interest as tools for elucidating the function of these proteins and for therapeutic intervention; however, only one small molecule GEF inhibitor, brefeldin A (BFA), is currently available. Here we used an aptamer displacement screen to identify SecinH3, a small molecule antagonist of cytohesins. The cytohesins are a class of BFA-resistant small GEFs for ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which regulate cytoskeletal organization, integrin activation or integrin signalling. The application of SecinH3 in human liver cells showed that insulin-receptor-complex-associated cytohesins are required for insulin signalling. SecinH3-treated mice show increased expression of gluconeogenic genes, reduced expression of glycolytic, fatty acid and ketone body metabolism genes in the liver, reduced liver glycogen stores, and a compensatory increase in plasma insulin. Thus, cytohesin inhibition results in hepatic insulin resistance. Because insulin resistance is among the earliest pathological changes in type 2 diabetes, our results show the potential of chemical biology for dissecting the molecular pathogenesis of this disease.
Viruses frequently persist in neurons, suggesting that these cells can evade immune surveillance. In a mouse model, 5 x 10(6) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), did not lyse infected neurons or cause immunopathologic injury. In contrast, intracerebral injection of less than 10(3) CTL caused disease and death when viral antigens were expressed on leptomeningeal and choroid plexus cells of the nervous system. The neuronal cell line OBL21 expresses little or no major histocompatibility (MHC) class I surface glycoproteins and when infected with LCMV, resisted lysis by virus-specific CTLs. Expression of MHC heavy chain messenger RNA was limited, but beta 2-microglobulin messenger RNA and protein was made normally. OBL21 cells were made sensitive to CTL lysis by transfection with a fusion gene encoding another MHC class I molecule. Hence, neuronal cells probably evade immune surveillance by failing to express MHC class I molecules.
Secretory chloride channels can be activated by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase in normal airway epithelial cells but not in cells from individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). In excised, inside-out patches of apical membrane of normal human airway cells and airway cells from three patients with CF, the chloride channels exhibited a characteristic outwardly rectifying current-voltage relation and depolarization-induced activation. Channels from normal tissues were activated by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C. However, chloride channels from CF patients could not be activated by either kinase. Thus, gating of normal epithelial chloride channels is regulated by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, and regulation by both kinases is defective in CF.
The role of the cell-surface molecule CTLA-4 in the regulation of T cell activation has been controversial. Here, lymph nodes and spleens of CTLA-4-deficient mice accumulated T cell blasts with up-regulated activation markers. These blast cells also infiltrated liver, heart, lung, and pancreas tissue, and amounts of serum immunoglobulin were elevated. The mice invariably became moribund by 3 to 4 weeks of age. Although CTLA-4-deficient T cells proliferated spontaneously and strongly when stimulated through the T cell receptor, they were sensitive to cell death induced by cross-linking of the Fas receptor and by gamma irradiation. Thus, CTLA-4 acts as a negative regulator of T cell activation and is vital for the control of lymphocyte homeostasis.
The Drosophila melanogaster gene Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) is homologous to mammalian Alk, a member of the Alk/Ltk family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We have previously shown that the Drosophila Alk RTK is crucial for visceral mesoderm development during early embryogenesis. Notably, observed Alk visceral mesoderm defects are highly reminiscent of the phenotype reported for the secreted molecule Jelly belly (Jeb). Here we show that Drosophila Alk is the receptor for Jeb in the developing visceral mesoderm, and that Jeb binding stimulates an Alk-driven, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated signalling pathway, which results in the expression of the downstream gene duf (also known as kirre)--needed for muscle fusion. This new signal transduction pathway drives specification of the muscle founder cells, and the regulation of Duf expression by the Drosophila Alk RTK explains the visceral-mesoderm-specific muscle fusion defects observed in both Alk and jeb mutant animals.
Hundreds of murine dilute mutations have been identified and analysed, making dilute one of the best genetically characterized of all mammalian loci. The recessive dilute (d) coat colour mutation carried by many inbred strains of mice produces a lightening of coat colour, caused by an abnormal adendritic melanocyte morphology that results in an uneven release of pigment granules into the developing hair shaft. Most dilute alleles (dilute-lethal) also produce a neurological defect, characterized by convulsions and opisthotonus, apparent at 8-10 days of age and continuing until the death of the animal at 2-3 weeks of age. The discovery that the original dilute allele (now termed dilute-viral or dV) is the result of the integration of an ecotropic murine leukaemia provirus has allowed the cloning of genomic DNA and in this study complementary DNA, from the dilute locus. The predicted dilute amino-acid sequence indicates that dilute encodes a novel type of myosin heavy chain, with a tail, or C-terminal, region that has elements of both type II (alpha-helical coiled-coil) and type I (non-coiled-coil) myosin heavy chains. Dilute transcripts are differentially expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues and are very abundant in neurons of the central nervous system, cephalic ganglia, and spinal ganglia. These results suggest an important role for the dilute gene product in the elaboration, maintenance, or function of cellular processes of melanocytes and neurons.
Five characters separate man from other hominoids-a large neocortex, bipedality, reduced anterior dentition with molar dominance, material culture, and unique sexual and reproductive behavior. Evidence provided by the fossil record, primate behavior, and demographic analysis shows that the traditional view that early human evolution was a direct consequence of brain expansion and material culture is incorrect, and that the unique sexual and reproductive behavior of man may be the sine qua non of human origin.
The Ndc80 complex is a key site of regulated kinetochore-microtubule attachment (a process required for cell division), but the molecular mechanism underlying its function remains unknown. Here we present a subnanometre-resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the human Ndc80 complex bound to microtubules, sufficient for precise docking of crystal structures of the component proteins. We find that the Ndc80 complex binds the microtubule with a tubulin monomer repeat, recognizing a- and b-tubulin at both intra- and inter-tubulin dimer interfaces in a manner that is sensitive to tubulin conformation. Furthermore, Ndc80 complexes self-associate along protofilaments through interactions mediated by the amino-terminal tail of the NDC80 protein, which is the site of phospho-regulation by Aurora B kinase. The complex's mode of interaction with the microtubule and its oligomerization suggest a mechanism by which Aurora B could regulate the stability of load-bearing kinetochore-microtubule attachments.
The central auditory system translates sound localization cues into a map of space guided, in part, by visual experience. In barn owls, this process takes place in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICX). However, to date, no trace of visual activity has been observed in this auditory nucleus. Here we show that strong visual responses, which are appropriate to guide auditory plasticity, appear in the ICX when inhibition is blocked in the optic tectum. Thus, visual spatial information is gated into the auditory system by an inhibitory mechanism that operates at a higher level in the brain.
Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, activates three different receptors that directly gate ion channels, namely receptors for AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl isoxozole propionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), and kainate, a structural analogue of glutamate. The contribution of AMPA and NMDA receptors to synaptic transmission and plasticity is well established. Recent work on the physiological function of kainate receptors has focused on the hippocampus, where repetitive activation of the mossy-fibre pathway generates a slow, kainate-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). Here we show that high-intensity single-shock stimulation (of duration 200 microseconds) of primary afferent sensory fibres produces a fast, kainate-receptor-mediated EPSC in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Activation of low-threshold afferent fibres generates typical AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs only, indicating that kainate receptors may be restricted to synapses formed by high-threshold nociceptive (pain-sensing) and thermoreceptive primary afferent fibres. Consistent with this possibility, kainate-receptor-mediated EPSCs are blocked by the analgesic mu-opiate-receptor agonist Damgo and spinal blockade of both kainate and AMPA receptors produces antinociception. Thus, spinal kainate receptors contribute to transmission of somatosensory inputs from the periphery to the brain.
Genomic imprinting results in preferential expression of the paternal or maternal allele of certain genes. We have performed a genome-wide characterization of imprinting in the mouse embryonic and adult brain. This approach uncovered parent-of-origin allelic effects of more than 1300 loci. We identified parental bias in the expression of individual genes and of specific transcript isoforms, with differences between brain regions. Many imprinted genes are expressed in neural systems associated with feeding and motivated behaviors, and parental biases preferentially target genetic pathways governing metabolism and cell adhesion. We observed a preferential maternal contribution to gene expression in the developing brain and a major paternal contribution in the adult brain. Thus, parental expression bias emerges as a major mode of epigenetic regulation in the brain.
Mice were trained to discriminate between scented and unscented air. After olfactory bulbs were removed, discrimination was lost, but returned with the formation of synaptic connections between regenerated primary olfactory neurons and the cortex of the forebrain. The acquisition of a second olfactory-mediated task by long-term bulbectomized mice and controls was indistinguishable. The results emphasize the plasticity of the nervous system, correlate the presence of neural connections between olfactory mucosa and forebrain with the recovery of olfactory function, suggest that olfactory-mediated memory resides at least in part outside the olfactory bulbs, and demonstrate that the bulbs are not required for the acquisition of olfactory tasks.
Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), and Walker-Warburg syndrome are congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) with associated developmental brain defects. Mutations reported in genes of FCMD and MEB patients suggest that the genes may be involved in protein glycosylation. Dystroglycan is a highly glycosylated component of the muscle dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that is also expressed in brain, where its function is unknown. Here we show that brain-selective deletion of dystroglycan in mice is sufficient to cause CMD-like brain malformations, including disarray of cerebral cortical layering, fusion of cerebral hemispheres and cerebellar folia, and aberrant migration of granule cells. Dystroglycan-null brain loses its high-affinity binding to the extracellular matrix protein laminin, and shows discontinuities in the pial surface basal lamina (glia limitans) that probably underlie the neuronal migration errors. Furthermore, mutant mice have severely blunted hippocampal long-term potentiation with electrophysiologic characterization indicating that dystroglycan might have a postsynaptic role in learning and memory. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that defects in dystroglycan are central to the pathogenesis of structural and functional brain abnormalities seen in CMD.
The CD4 receptor on human T cells has been shown to play an integral part in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection process. Recombinant soluble human CD4 (rCD4) was tested for its ability to inhibit SIVagm, an HIV-like virus that naturally infects African green monkeys, in order to define T cell surface receptors critical for SIVagm infection. The rCD4 was found to enhance SIVagm infection of a human T cell line by as much as 18-fold, whereas HIV-1 infection was blocked by rCD4. Induction of syncytium formation and de novo protein synthesis were observed within the first 24 hours after SIVagm infection, whereas this process took 4 to 6 days in the absence of rCD4. This enhancing effect could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed to rCD4. The enhancing effect could be abrogated with antibodies from naturally infected African green monkeys with inhibitory titers of from 1:2,000 to 1:10,000; these antibodies did not neutralize SIVagm infection in the absence of rCD4. Viral enhancement of SIVagm infection by rCD4 may result from the modulation of the viral membrane through gp120-CD4 binding, thus facilitating secondary events involved in viral fusion and penetration.
One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the neurofibrillary tangle, which contains paired helical filaments (PHFs) composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau is hyperphosphorylated in PHFs, and phosphorylation of tau abolishes its ability to bind microtubules and promote microtubule assembly. Restoring the function of phosphorylated tau might prevent or reverse PHF formation in Alzheimer's disease. Phosphorylation on a serine or threonine that precedes proline (pS/T-P) alters the rate of prolyl isomerization and creates a binding site for the WW domain of the prolyl isomerase Pin1. Pin1 specifically isomerizes pS/T-P bonds and regulates the function of mitotic phosphoproteins. Here we show that Pin1 binds to only one pT-P motif in tau and copurifies with PHFs, resulting in depletion of soluble Pin1 in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Pin1 can restore the ability of phosphorylated tau to bind microtubules and promote microtubule assembly in vitro. As depletion of Pin1 induces mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death, sequestration of Pin1 into PHFs may contribute to neuronal death. These findings provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Cannabinoid receptors are molecular targets for marijuana and hashish, the widespread drugs of abuse. These receptors are expressed in areas of the central nervous system that contribute in important ways to the control of memory, cognition, movement and pain perception. Indeed, such functions can be strongly influenced by cannabinoid drugs, with consequences that include euphoria, analgesia, sedation and memory impairment. Although the pharmacology of cannabinoid drugs is now beginning to be understood, we still lack essential information on the endogenous signalling system(s) by which cannabinoid receptors are normally engaged. An endogenous ligand for cannabinoid receptors, anandamide, has been described. Here we report that sn-2 arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), a cannabinoid ligand isolated from intestinal tissue, is present in brain in amounts 170 times greater than anandamide. 2-AG is produced in hippocampal slices by stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals, an excitatory fibre tract that projects from CA3 to CA1 neurons. Formation of 2-AG is calcium dependent and is mediated by the enzymes phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase. 2-AG activates neuronal cannabinoid receptors as a full agonist, and prevents the induction of long-term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses. Our results indicate that 2-AG is a second endogenous cannabinoid ligand in the central nervous system.
The site of action of the antispastic drug baclofen has long been considered to reside in the spinal cord although supraspinal effects have also been reported. This beta-chlorophenyl derivative of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) depresses both monosynaptic and polysynaptic transmission in the cord possibly through a decrease in transmitter release rather than by any antagonism at postsynaptic receptors. Recently, baclofen has been shown to be a selective ligand for a bicuculline-insensitive GABA receptor (GABAB) site that occurs widely in the mammalian central nervous system including the spinal cord. The apparent importance of the cord in the therapeutic effects of this drug prompted us to ask whether they involve GABAB site activation. As an initial step we have located these receptors by autoradiography, comparing them with classical GABAA sites. We report here that GABAB sites, unlike GABAA sites, are present in high concentrations in laminae I, II, III and IV of the dorsal horn and that after the neonatal administration of capsaicin this binding is reduced by 40-50%.
Although information storage in the central nervous system is thought to be primarily mediated by various forms of synaptic plasticity, other mechanisms, such as modifications in membrane excitability, are available. Local dendritic spikes are nonlinear voltage events that are initiated within dendritic branches by spatially clustered and temporally synchronous synaptic input. That local spikes selectively respond only to appropriately correlated input allows them to function as input feature detectors and potentially as powerful information storage mechanisms. However, it is currently unknown whether any effective form of local dendritic spike plasticity exists. Here we show that the coupling between local dendritic spikes and the soma of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons can be modified in a branch-specific manner through an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent regulation of dendritic Kv4.2 potassium channels. These data suggest that compartmentalized changes in branch excitability could store multiple complex features of synaptic input, such as their spatio-temporal correlation. We propose that this 'branch strength potentiation' represents a previously unknown form of information storage that is distinct from that produced by changes in synaptic efficacy both at the mechanistic level and in the type of information stored.
Stimulus-evoked oscillatory synchronization of activity has been observed in many neural systems, including the cerebral cortex of mammals and the brain of insects. The possible functions of such rhythmic synchronization in neural coding, however, remain largely speculative. In the locust, odours evoke activity in dynamic (evolving) ensembles of transiently synchronized neurons. We report here that the active neurons composing these ensembles change in a stimulus-specific manner and with a high degree of reliability on a cycle-by-cycle basis during an odour response. Hence, information about an odour is contained not only in the neural assembly active at each oscillation cycle, but also in the precise temporal sequence in which these assemblies are updated during an odour response. Neural coding with oscillations thus allows combinatorial representations in time as well as in space.
Isoprenaline is a beta-adrenergic agonist of clinical importance as a remedy for asthma. In airway smooth muscle its relaxant action is accompanied by hyperpolarization of the membrane and elevation of the level of intracellular cyclic AMP. Hyperpolarization and relaxation are also induced by drugs such as forskolin, theophylline and dibutyryl cAMP, indicating that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation is involved in producing the electrical response. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) has been reported to activate Ca2+-dependent K+ channels in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells and snail neurons. The membrane of tracheal smooth-muscle cells is characterized by a dense distribution of Ca2+-dependent K+-channels. We have now examined the effect of isoprenaline and protein kinase A on Ca2+-dependent K+-channels in isolated smooth muscle cells of rabbit trachea, using the patch-clamp technique. Our results show that the open-state probability of Ca2+-dependent K+-channel of tracheal myocytes is reversibly increased by either extracellular application of isoprenaline or intracellar application of protein kinase A. We also show that this effect is significantly enhanced and prolonged in the presence of a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid.
Myosin II, which converts the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis into the movement of actin filaments, is a hexamer of two heavy chains, two essential light chains, and two regulatory light chains (RLCs). Dictyostelium myosin II is known to be regulated in vitro by phosphorylation of the RLC. Cells in which the wild-type myosin II heavy chain was replaced with a recombinant form that lacks the binding site for RLC carried out cytokinesis and almost normal development, processes known to be dependent on functional myosin II. Characterization of the purified recombinant protein suggests that a complex of RLC and the RLC binding site of the heavy chain plays an inhibitory role for adenosine triphosphatase activity and a structural role for the movement of myosin along actin.
The A4 protein (or beta-protein) is a 42- or 43-amino-acid peptide present in the extracellular neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease and is derived from a membrane-bound amyloid protein precursor (APP). Three forms of APP have been described and are referred to as APP695, APP751 and APP770, reflecting the number of amino acids encoded for by their respective complementary DNAs. The two larger APPs contain a 57-amino-acid insert with striking homology to the Kunitz family of protease inhibitors. Here we report that the deduced amino-terminal sequence of APP is identical to the sequence of a cell-secreted protease inhibitor, protease nexin-II (PN-II). To confirm this finding, APP751 and APP695 cDNAs were over-expressed in the human 293 cell line, and the secreted N-terminal extracellular domains of these APPs were purified to near homogeneity from the tissue-culture medium. The relative molecular mass and high-affinity binding to dextran sulphate of secreted APP751 were consistent with that of PN-II. Functionally, secreted APP751 formed stable, non-covalent, inhibitory complexes with trypsin. Secreted APP695 did not form complexes with trypsin. We conclude that the secreted form of APP with the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain is PN-II.
Generalization is a cognitive ability that allows similar stimuli along a given dimension to be treated as equivalents. Insects exhibit high levels of visual generalization. Honeybees trained to recognize complex visual stimuli on the basis of a single feature generalize their choice to novel stimuli sharing that common feature with the trained stimuli. The demonstration of this kind of performance has been limited to the use of a single visual feature, and the possibility that bees link different features in learning a visual pattern has been denied. Here we show that honeybees trained with a series of complex patterns sharing a common layout comprising four edge orientations remember these orientations simultaneously in their appropriate positions, and generalize their response to novel stimuli that preserve the trained layout. Honeybees also generalize their response to patterns with fewer correct orientations, depending on their match with the trained layout. Stimulation of the achromatic L-photoreceptor input is necessary for this task. The mini-brain of the honeybee can thus extract regularities in its environment and establish correspondences among correlated features. It can thus generate a large set of object descriptions from a finite set of elements.
Sex-specific alternative processing of doublesex (dsx) precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) regulates somatic sexual differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster. Cotransfection analyses in which the dsx gene and the female-specific transformer (tra) and transformer-2 (tra-2) complementary DNAs were expressed in Drosophila Kc cells revealed that female-specific splicing of the dsx transcript was positively regulated by the products of the tra and tra-2 genes. Furthermore, analyses of mutant constructs of dsx showed that a portion of the female-specific exon sequence was required for regulation of dsx pre-messenger RNA splicing.
Presynaptic nerve terminals release neurotransmitters repeatedly, often at high frequency, and in relative isolation from neuronal cell bodies. Repeated release requires cycles of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-complex assembly and disassembly, with continuous generation of reactive SNARE-protein intermediates. Although many forms of neurodegeneration initiate presynaptically, only few pathogenic mechanisms are known, and the functions of presynaptic proteins linked to neurodegeneration, such as a-synuclein, remain unclear. Here, we show that maintenance of continuous presynaptic SNARE-complex assembly required a nonclassical chaperone activity mediated by synucleins. Specifically, a-synuclein directly bound to the SNARE-protein synaptobrevin-2/vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and promoted SNARE-complex assembly. Moreover, triple-knockout mice lacking synucleins developed age-dependent neurological impairments, exhibited decreased SNARE-complex assembly, and died prematurely. Thus, synucleins may function to sustain normal SNARE-complex assembly in a presynaptic terminal during aging.
The presence of a novel receptor for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on peripheral autonomic nerve terminals and in mammalian brain slices has been described recently. This receptor differs from the classical GABA site as it is unaffected by recognized GABA antagonists such as bicuculline and is not sensitive to the majority of accepted GABA-mimetics such as 3-aminopropanesulphonic acid (3-APS) or isoguvacine. We propose to designate the classical site as the GABA A and the novel site as the GABA B receptor. The beta-p-chlorophenyl derivative of GABA, baclofen, is stereospecifically active at the GABA B site whereas it is devoid of activity at the classical GABA A3 site. We now report that high-affinity saturable binding of 3H-baclofen and 3H-GABA to the GABA B site can be detected in fragments of crude synaptic membranes prepared from rat brain. The results support the concept of a novel GABA receptor within the mammalian brain and show that GABA and baclofen can compete for the same recognition site.
The massive visual input from the eye to the brain requires selective processing of some visual information at the expense of other information, a process referred to as visual attention. Increases in the responses of visual neurons with attention have been extensively studied along the visual processing streams in monkey cerebral cortex, from primary visual areas to parietal and frontal cortex. Here we show, by recording neurons in attending macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), that attention modulates visual signals before they even reach cortex by increasing responses of both magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the first relay between retina and cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). At the same time, attention decreases neuronal responses in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Crick argued for such modulation of the LGN by observing that it is inhibited by the TRN, and suggested that "if the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, the reticular complex might be described as the guardian of the gateway", a reciprocal relationship we now show to be more than just hypothesis. The reciprocal modulation in LGN and TRN appears only during the initial visual response, but the modulation of LGN reappears later in the response, suggesting separate early and late sources of attentional modulation in LGN.
Norepinephrine has a strongly lateralized distribution in the human thalamus. In the pulvinar region the left hemisphere is rich in norepinephrine, whereas in the somatosensory input area the right hemisphere has a higher concentration of this catecholamine. Such naturally occurring left-right differences in concentration of a neurotransmitter represent a new aspect of hemispheric specialization.
Numerous peptides appear to be neurotransmitter candidates in the brain. Some, such as the opioid peptide enkephalins, neurotensin, and substance P, were first isolaterd from the brain. Peptides, such as cholecystokinin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, were known as intestinal hormones and later recognized as brain constituents. Certain hypothalamic-releasing hormones, pituitary peptides, and blood-derived peptides like angiotensin II and bradykinin, may also be central neurotransmitters. The diversity of localization of these peptides throughout the brain implies a multiplicity of potential roles.
The neurotrophin receptor TrkB is essential for normal function of the mammalian brain. It is expressed in three splice variants. Full-length receptors (TrkB(FL)) possess an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and are considered as those TrkB receptors that mediate the crucial effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5). By contrast, truncated receptors (TrkB-T1 and TrkB-T2) lack tyrosine kinase activity and have not been reported to elicit rapid intracellular signalling. Here we show that astrocytes predominately express TrkB-T1 and respond to brief application of BDNF by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. The calcium transients are insensitive to the tyrosine kinase blocker K-252a and persist in mutant mice lacking TrkB(FL). By contrast, neurons produce rapid BDNF-evoked signals through TrkB(FL) and the Na(v)1.9 channel. Expression of antisense TrkB messenger RNA strongly reduces BDNF-evoked calcium signals in glia. Thus, our results show that, unexpectedly, TrkB-T1 has a direct signalling role in mediating inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent calcium release; in addition, they identify a previously unknown mechanism of neurotrophin action in the brain.
Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) contain multiple protein-binding domains that allow them to assemble specific multiprotein complexes in particular regions of the cell. CASK/LIN-2, a MAGUK required for EGF receptor localization and signalling in Caenorhabditis elegans, contains a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-like domain followed by PDZ, SH3 and guanylate kinase-like domains. In adult rat brain, CASK is concentrated at neuronal synapses and binds to the cell-surface proteins neurexin and syndecan and the cytoplasmic proteins Mint/LIN-10 and Veli/LIN-7. Here we report that, through its guanylate kinase domain, CASK interacts with Tbr-1, a T-box transcription factor that is involved in forebrain development. CASK enters the nucleus and binds to a specific DNA sequence (the T-element) in a complex with Tbr-1. CASK acts as a coactivator of Tbr-1 to induce transcription of T-element containing genes, including reelin, a gene that is essential for cerebrocortical development. Our findings show that a MAGUK which is usually associated with cell junctions has a transcription regulation function.
Protein phosphorylation is important in synaptic transmission and plasticity. At the neuromuscular junction, phosphorylation of acetylcholine (ACh) receptor-channels increases the rate of agonist-induced channel desensitization. In contrast, potentiation of ACh channel activity through protein phosphorylation has not been described. We report here that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide present at presynaptic motor nerve terminals, enhances the postsynaptic response at developing neuromuscular junctions by increasing the burst duration of embryonic ACh channels. The effect of CGRP on these ACh channels is mimicked by dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and prevented by a specific peptide inhibitor of PKA. Moreover, postsynaptic inhibition of PKA reduced the amplitude and decay time of spontaneous synaptic currents, suggesting that endogenous CGRP may act as a potentiating factor during the early phase of synaptogenesis.
Simocyclinones are bifunctional antibiotics that inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase by preventing DNA binding to the enzyme. We report the crystal structure of the complex formed between the N-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli gyrase A subunit and simocyclinone D8, revealing two binding pockets that separately accommodate the aminocoumarin and polyketide moieties of the antibiotic. These are close to, but distinct from, the quinolone-binding site, consistent with our observations that several mutations in this region confer resistance to both agents. Biochemical studies show that the individual moieties of simocyclinone D8 are comparatively weak inhibitors of gyrase relative to the parent compound, but their combination generates a more potent inhibitor. Our results should facilitate the design of drug molecules that target these unexploited binding pockets.
Extracellular signals often result in simultaneous activation of both the Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways (where ERK is extracellular-regulated kinase, MEK is mitogen-activated protein kinase or ERK kinase, and PI3K is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). However, these two signaling pathways were shown to exert opposing effects on muscle cell hypertrophy. Furthermore, the PI3K-Akt pathway was shown to inhibit the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway; this cross-regulation depended on the differentiation state of the cell: Akt activation inhibited the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in differentiated myotubes, but not in their myoblast precursors. The stage-specific inhibitory action of Akt correlated with its stage-specific ability to form a complex with Raf, suggesting the existence of differentially expressed mediators of an inhibitory Akt-Raf complex.
The mammalian neocortex is subdivided into functionally distinct areas differing in cytoarchitecture and connectivity. Areal specification is thought to occur late in development and to be controlled by extrinsic cues, particularly thalamic afferents. We have produced a transgenic mouse line in which beta-galactosidase expression in the neocortex is largely restricted to layer-IV neurons of the somatosensory area. Transgene expression in these mice may be considered as an intrinsic marker of a somatosensory cortex identity. We investigated whether the fate of pieces of embryonic cortex from transgenic embryos is modified after transplantation to ectopic locations. Parietal or occipital cortex obtained on embryonic days 14-16 maintained their characteristics with respect to transgene expression after heterotopic transplantation to the cerebellum or neocortex of newborn hosts. This shows that the specification of neocortical areas involves a previously unsuspected early step of areal determination.
Interactions between neural cell surfaces seem to be of prime importance during neuroontogenesis, and responsible for the guidance of migrating neuroblasts and growing axons and for the formation of synapses. Little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms, but most hypotheses imply the existence of cell-surface molecules that mediate the formation of transient or permanent bonds between neural cells. Recently, a membrane glycoprotein called neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) has been characterized in chick and rodent nervous tissue that appears to act as a ligand in adhesion among neural cell bodies or neurites. We have identified a mouse neural surface glycoprotein, named BSP-2 (ref. 7), which by criteriaof electrophoretic migration, developmental changes, amino acid and sugar composition seems to be closely related or identical to N-CAM. Both BSP-2 (refs 8, 9) and N-CAM undergo conversion from an embryonic to an adult form during brain development and it has been suggested that this transition changes the adhesive properties or the binding specificity of the molecule. Using a neuroblastoma line to study functional differences between embryonic and adult BSP-2/N-CAM molecules, we show here that liposomes bearing adult BSP-2 but not those bearing the embryonic form adhere to neuroblastoma cells, demonstrating that the two forms do indeed possess different binding properties.
As a consequence of alternative RNA processing events, a single rat gene can generate messenger RNA's (mRNA's) encoding either calcitonin or a neuropeptide referred to as alpha-type calcitonin gene-related peptide (alpha-CGRP). An mRNA product of a related gene has been identified in rat brain and thyroid encoding the protein precursor of a peptide differing from alpha-CGRP by only a single amino acid. The RNA encoding this peptide, which is referred to as beta-CGRP, appears to be the only mature transcript of the beta-CGRP gene. Hybridization histochemistry reveals a similar distribution of alpha- and beta-CGRP mRNA's, but their relative levels of expression vary in different cranial nerve nuclei. Thus beta-CGRP is a new member of a family of related genes with potential functions in regulating the transduction of sensory and motor information.
A long-standing conjecture in neuroscience is that aspects of cognition depend on the brain's ability to self-generate sequential neuronal activity. We found that reliably and continually changing cell assemblies in the rat hippocampus appeared not only during spatial navigation but also in the absence of changing environmental or body-derived inputs. During the delay period of a memory task, each moment in time was characterized by the activity of a particular assembly of neurons. Identical initial conditions triggered a similar assembly sequence, whereas different conditions gave rise to different sequences, thereby predicting behavioral choices, including errors. Such sequences were not formed in control (nonmemory) tasks. We hypothesize that neuronal representations, evolved for encoding distance in spatial navigation, also support episodic recall and the planning of action sequences.
The cerebral cortex of the human brain is a sheet of about 10 billion neurons divided into discrete subdivisions or areas that process particular aspects of sensation, movement, and cognition. Recent evidence has begun to transform our understanding of how cortical areas form, make specific connections with other brain regions, develop unique processing networks, and adapt to changes in inputs.
A reticular stimulation producing a powerful arousal reaction decreases the potential in the cochlear nucleus evoked by a click. This reduction results from the contraction of the middle ear muscles, which lessens the pressure transmitted to the cochlea, and is not due to a direct neural inhibitory effect at the level of the first synapse of the auditory pathway.
Several decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological studies have established that visual signals are enhanced at the locus of attention. What remains a mystery is the mechanism that initiates biases in the strength of visual representations. Recent evidence argues that, during spatial attention, these biases reflect nascent saccadic eye movement commands. We examined the functional interaction of saccade preparation and visual coding by electrically stimulating sites within the frontal eye fields (FEF) and measuring its effect on the activity of neurons in extrastriate visual cortex. Here we show that visual responses in area V4 could be enhanced after brief stimulation of retinotopically corresponding sites within the FEF using currents below that needed to evoke saccades. The magnitude of the enhancement depended on the effectiveness of receptive field stimuli as well as on the presence of competing stimuli outside the receptive field. Stimulation of non-corresponding FEF representations could suppress V4 responses. The results suggest that the gain of visual signals is modified according to the strength of spatially corresponding eye movement commands.
It has been proposed that three major receptor subtypes subserve the putative transmitter role of glutamate and aspartate in the mammalian central nervous system. One subtype is classified by the specific agonist N-methylaspartate (NMA) and the specific antagonist 4-amino-2-phosphonovaleric acid. It has been shown recently that excitation of neurones by NMA is also selectively reduced by dissociative anaesthetics such as ketamine and phencyclidine and by sigma opiates, drugs of abuse with common psychotomimetic properties. Responses to NMA have an unusual voltage relation which may result from a voltage-dependent block of the activated channel by physiological concentrations of magnesium. No synaptic potential with properties similar to those of responses to NMA, however, has yet been reported. We describe here an excitatory postsynaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) evoked by electrical stimulation of the white matter and recorded intracellularly from pyramidal cells in slices of rat somatosensory cortex. This e.p.s.p. has the appropriate voltage relation and sensitivity to Mg2+ and ketamine to be an NMA receptor-mediated synapse and a potential central site for the psychotomimetic actions of ketamine.
Some eukaryotic genes can be expressed in bacteria but there are few examples of the expression of prokaryotic genes in eukaryotes. Antibiotic G418 is a 2-deoxystreptamine antibiotic that is structurally related to gentamicin but has inhibitory activity against a much wider variety of pro- and eukaryotic organisms. In bacteria, resistance to G418 can be determined by several plasmid-encoded modifiying enzymes and, in view of the broad spectrum of activity of G418, we considered that this antibiotic might be useful as a selective agent for the introduction of these antibiotic resistance genes into a eukaryotic organism such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Additional impetus for these experiments came from the knowledge that certain of the G418-resistance determinants in bacteria are carried on transposable elements; a study of the properties of these elements in eukaryotes would be intriguing.
Despite the great diversity of shapes exhibited by different classes of nerve cells, nearly all neurons share one feature in that they have a single axon and several dendrites. The two types of processes differ in their morphology, in their rate of growth, in the macromolecular composition of their cytoskeletons and surface membranes, and in their synaptic polarity. When hippocampal neurons are dissociated from the embryonic brain and cultured, they reproducibly establish this basic form with a single axon and several dendrites, despite the absence of any spatially organized environmental cues, and without the need for cell to cell contact. We have cut the axons of young hippocampal neurons within a day of their development: in some cases the initial axon regenerated, but more frequently one of the other processes, which if undisturbed would have become a dendrite, instead became the axon. Frequently the stump of the original axon persisted following the transection and subsequently became a dendrite. Evidently the neuronal processes that first develop in culture have the capacity to form either axons or dendrites. The acquisition of axonal characteristics by one neuronal process apparently inhibits the others from becoming axons, so they subsequently become dendrites.
Kainic (KA) and quisqualic (QA) acids have a potent depolarizing action on a variety of neurones of the central nervous system, including retinal horizontal cells. We now report the novel finding that at low concentrations (1-3 microM), these 'excitatory' amino acids hyperpolarize horizontal cells of the fish retina. We show that the hyperpolarizing effects of both KA and QA are reversed by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist bicuculline, whereas a second GABA antagonist, picrotoxin, reverses the effects of KA, but not of QA. Neither GABA antagonist influences horizontal cell depolarization by 50 microM KA or 50 microM QA, thus the excitatory (depolarizing and inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) effects of the amino acids involve independent mechanisms. We provide evidence that the hyperpolarizing effects are not mediated by the dopaminergic pathways associated with retinal horizontal cells.
The tachykinins are a family of peptides with the carboxyl terminal amino acid sequence Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2. Three major mammalian tachykinins have been identified--substance K, neuromedin K, and substance P--but only two tachykinin receptors have been postulated. Three tachykinins were labeled with radioiodinated Bolton-Hunter reagent and their binding characteristics were determined in crude membrane suspensions from several tissues. In cerebral cortex labeled eledoisin exhibited high-affinity binding that was inhibited by tachykinins in a manner indicating a definitive SP-E receptor site. In gastrointestinal smooth muscle and bladder, high-affinity binding of labeled substance P was inhibited in a pattern indicating a definitive SP-P site. In intestinal smooth muscle and bladder, however, labeled substance K and labeled eledoisin were both bound in a pattern indicating a preference for substance K itself. The results suggest the existence of three distinct types of tachykinin receptors: SP-P, SP-E, and SP-K.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a large class of regulatory RNAs that repress target messenger RNAs to control various biological processes. Accordingly, miRNA biogenesis is highly regulated, controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and overexpression and underexpression of miRNAs are linked to various human diseases, particularly cancers. As RNA concentrations are generally a function of biogenesis and turnover, active miRNA degradation might also modulate miRNA accumulation, and the plant 3'-->5' exonuclease SDN1 has been implicated in miRNA turnover. Here we report that degradation of mature miRNAs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, mediated by the 5'-->3' exoribonuclease XRN-2, affects functional miRNA homeostasis in vivo. We recapitulate XRN-2-dependent miRNA turnover in larval lysates, where processing of precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNA) by Dicer, unannealing of the miRNA duplex and loading of the mature miRNA into the Argonaute protein of the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) are coupled processes that precede degradation of the mature miRNA. Although Argonaute:miRNA complexes are highly resistant to salt, larval lysate promotes efficient release of the miRNA, exposing it to degradation by XRN-2. Release and degradation can both be blocked by the addition of miRNA target RNA. Our results therefore suggest the presence of an additional layer of regulation of animal miRNA activity that might be important for rapid changes of miRNA expression profiles during developmental transitions and for the maintenance of steady-state concentrations of miRNAs. This pathway might represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention on miRNA expression.
The neocortex receives information about the environment and the rest of the brain through pathways from the thalamus. These pathways have frequency-dependent properties that can strongly influence their effect on the neocortex. In 1943 Morison and Dempsey described "augmenting responses," a form of short-term plasticity in some thalamocortical pathways that is triggered by 8- to 15-hertz activation. Results from anesthetized rats showed that the augmenting response is initiated by pyramidal cells in layer V. The augmenting response was also observed in awake, unrestrained animals and was found to be dynamically modulated by their behavioral state.
It has been suggested that placebo analgesia involves both higher order cognitive networks and endogenous opioid systems. The rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and the brainstem are implicated in opioid analgesia, suggesting a similar role for these structures in placebo analgesia. Using positron emission tomography, we confirmed that both opioid and placebo analgesia are associated with increased activity in the rACC. We also observed a covariation between the activity in the rACC and the brainstem during both opioid and placebo analgesia, but not during the pain-only condition. These findings indicate a related neural mechanism in placebo and opioid analgesia.
Encoding of information in the cortex is thought to depend on synchronous firing of cortical neurons. Inhibitory neurons are known to be critical in the coordination of cortical activity, but how interaction among inhibitory cells promotes synchrony is not well understood. To address this issue directly, we have recorded simultaneously from pairs of fast-spiking (FS) cells, a type of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neocortical interneuron. Here we report a high occurrence of electrical coupling among FS cells. Electrical synapses were not found among pyramidal neurons or between FS cells and other cortical cells. Some FS cells were interconnected by both electrical and GABAergic synapses. We show that communication through electrical synapses allows excitatory signalling among inhibitory cells and promotes their synchronous spiking. These results indicate that electrical synapses establish a network of fast-spiking cells in the neocortex which may play a key role in coordinating cortical activity.
Neurons in deep laminae of the rabbit cingulate cortex develop discriminative activity at an early stage of behavioral discrimination learning, whereas neurons in the anteroventral nucleus of thalamus and neurons in the superficial cortical laminae develop such activity in a late stage of behavioral learning. It is hypothesized that early-forming discriminative neuronal activity, relayed to anteroventral neurons via the corticothalamic pathway, contributes to the construction of changes underlying the late-forming neuronal discrimination in the anteroventral nucleus. The resultant late discriminative activity in the anteroventral nucleus is then relayed via the thalamocortical pathway back to the superficial cortical laminae, promoting disengagement of cortex from further task-processing.
Electrophoretically pure mouse interferon inhibits erythropoietin-dependent proliferation of committed erythroid precursors (CFU-E) obtained either from adult mouse bone marrow or from 14-day fetal mouse livers. The degree of inhibition is significantly influenced by the genotype of the cell donor; about ten times as much interferon is required to inhibit proliferation of CFU-E from C57BL/6 than is needed for comparable inhibition of CFU-E from BALB/c or Swiss mice. These strain-dependent results point to the existence of genes that influence the degree of the inhibitory effect of interferon on cell multiplication.
Administration of morphine or ethanol to rats produces a decrease in regional brain calcium in vivo. This effect is selectively antagonized by the stereospecific narcotic antagonist naloxone. Reserpine and the dopamine-acetaldehyde conjugate salsolinol also produce a depletion of regional brain calcium, but only the salsolinol depletion is antagonized by naloxone. Experiments with naloxone provide evidence for two calcium-sensitive pools in the central nervous system.
Lipocortin-like proteins are a family of steroid-induced inhibitors of phospholipase activity with potential anti-inflammatory activity. Related proteins have been detected in a variety of tissues and species. The best characterized form is a protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) approximately 40,000 (40K), which is phosphorylated in vivo by protein tyrosine kinases and by protein serine-threonine kinases. It has been proposed that the phospholipase inhibitory activity of lipocortin can be regulated by its phosphorylation. In the A431 cell line, a protein of approximately 35K is phosphorylated by the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Here we report that human lipocortin is phosphorylated near its amino terminus by the EGF receptor/kinase. By peptide mapping and immunological analyses, we show that lipocortin and the endogenous 35K substrate for the EGF receptor/kinase from A431 cells are the same protein.
There is substantial evidence that human serum contains antibodies to many autoantigens. For example, all healthy people have autoantibodies (immunoglobulin M) to some undefined brain antigens. In this study immunoblots and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect antibodies to neural tissues in serum samples from 200 healthy people and 200 patients with various neurological diseases. Ninety-nine percent of the 400 subjects had serum immunoglobulin M and 95 percent had immunoglobulin G that bound to a 200-kilodalton protein in homogenates of neural tissues. In most cases there were no antibodies to anything else in the homogenates. The 200-kilodalton protein was the heaviest of the neurofilament triplet proteins. These observations do not support a role for antibodies to the 200-kilodalton protein of neurofilaments in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases.
Collagenase is a zinc-dependent endoproteinase and is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of enzymes. The MMPs participate in connective tissue remodeling events and aberrant regulation has been associated with several pathologies. The 2.4 angstrom resolution structure of the inhibited enzyme revealed that, in addition to the catalytic zinc, there is a second zinc ion and a calcium ion which play a major role in stabilizing the tertiary structure of collagenase. Despite scant sequence homology, collagenase shares structural homology with two other endoproteinases, bacterial thermolysin and crayfish astacin. The detailed description of protein-inhibitor interactions present in the structure will aid in the design of compounds that selectively inhibit individual members of the MMP family. Such inhibitors will be useful in examining the function of MMPs in pathological processes.
Vesicle fusion and recycling are particularly critical for ongoing neurotransmitter release in the small nerve terminals of the brain, which typically contain about 30 functional vesicles. However, the modes of exocytosis and endocytosis that operate at synapses of the central nervous system are incompletely understood. Here we show real-time visualization of a single vesicle fusing at a small synapse of the central nervous system, made possible by highly intensified charge-coupled device imaging of hippocampal synaptic terminals, in which a single vesicle was labelled with the fluorescent membrane marker FM1-43 (ref. 6). In a small number of cases, full loss of fluorescent membrane dye was elicited by a single action potential, consistent with classical complete collapse. In most cases, however, action potentials triggered only partial loss of fluorescence, suggesting vesicular retention of membrane marker, consistent with 'kiss-and-run' vesicle cycling. An alternative hypothesis of independent fusion of partially stained vesicles arising from endosomal splitting could be excluded by observations on the size and timing of successive fusion events. Thus, our experimental evidence supports a predominance of kiss-and-run fusion events and rapid vesicular re-use.
The mammalian brain comprises a number of functionally distinct systems. It might therefore be expected that natural selection on particular behavioural capacities would have caused size changes selectively, in the systems mediating those capacities. It has been claimed, however, that developmental constraints limited such mosaic evolution, causing co-ordinated size change among individual brain components. Here we analyse comparative data to demonstrate that mosaic change has been an important factor in brain structure evolution. First, the neocortex shows about a fivefold difference in volume between primates and insectivores even after accounting for its scaling relationship with the rest of the brain. Second, brain structures with major anatomical and functional links evolved together independently of evolutionary change in other structures. This is true at the level of both basic brain subdivisions and more fine-grained functional systems. Hence, brain evolution in these groups involved complex relationships among individual brain components.
Long-term recording from single lumbar motoneurons of intact cats revealed activation patterns fundamentally different from those seen in decerebrate preparations. In intact cats, motoneuron bursts showed marked rate modulation without initial doublets. Each unit's frequencygram generally resembled the envelope of the gross electromyogram simultaneously recorded from the corresponding muscle. Average and peak discharge rates increased for faster gaits. These findings suggest that, in cat locomotion, rate modulation is a more important contributor to force regulation than was previously thought.
Synaptojanin is a nerve terminal protein of relative molecular mass 145,000 which appears to participate with dynamin in synaptic vesicle recycling. The central region of synaptojanin defines it as a member of the inositol-5-phosphatase family, which includes the product of the gene that is defective in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe. Synaptojanin has 5-phosphatase activity and its amino-terminal domain is homologous with the yeast protein Sac1 (Rsd1), which is genetically implicated in phospholipid metabolism and in the function of the actin cytoskeleton. The carboxy terminus, which is of different lengths in adult and developing neurons owing to the alternative use of two termination sites, is proline-rich, consistent with the reported interaction of synaptojanin with the SH3 domains of Grb2 (refs 1, 2). Synaptojanin is the only other major brain protein besides dynamin that binds the SH3 domain of amphiphysin, a presynaptic protein with a putative function in endocytosis. Our results suggest a link between phosphoinositide metabolism and synaptic vesicle recycling.
Interest in the Brattleboro diabetes insipidus rat has resurged with the recent increase in research on brain peptides. Various reports have suggested that in these rats, the impaired ability for memory consolidation is due essentially to a chronic lack of vasopressin. On the other hand, sleep stages and particularly the paradoxical phase of sleep have been shown to have a key role in the processes of learning and memory consolidation. Curiously, the possible involvement of sleep deficits in the impairment of memory function in the Brattleboro rat has never been suspected. Here I report a significant reduction (38%) in the daily duration of paradoxical sleep (PS) in the homozygous diabetes insipidus (HODI) rat compared to the heterozygous Long Evans strain. Normal or increased durations of PS were observed after intravenous (i.v.) administration of vasopressin but also when the normal daily water intake (240 ml) was infused i.v. These results provide direct evidence that PS deficits in the HODI rat are not due to the absence of vasopressin. They also suggest that the impaired ability for learning and memory processes are probably due to the impairment of PS rather than to some direct consequence of the hereditary lack of vasopressin.
Beta-galactosidase-deficient siblings in two litters of English springer spaniel puppies showed a progressive neurological impairment, dwarfism, orbital hypertelorism, and dysostosis multiplex. An excess of GM1-ganglioside was found in the brain. Three abnormal oligosaccharides were present in samples of urine, brain, liver, and cartilage. Light microscopy of selected tissue specimens revealed cytoplasmic vacuoles in neurons, circulating blood cells, macrophages, and chondrocytes. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that these membrane-bound vacuoles were of two types--one containing lamellated membranes and the other, finely granular material. These clinical and pathological findings are similar to those observed in human patients affected by the infantile form of GM1-gangliosidosis.
In rats after portacaval anastomosis (an animal model of chronic liver disease), transport of tryptophan and other members of the large neutral amino acid group from blood to brain was markedly enhanced. Increased transport activity was apparently restricted to the neutral amino acid transport system, since brain uptake of glucose, inulin, and tyramine was unaffected while blood-brain arginine transport was significantly reduced. These results strikingly confirm the hypothesis that carrier-mediated blood-brain transport is the limiting factor determining the availability of the neutral amino acids to the brain. The encephalopathy associated with cirrhosis may be the result of abnormal neurotransmitter metabolism and neurotransmission secondary to increased neutral amino acid  transport activity and an increased brain content of members of the neutral amino acid group.
After injection of tritiated amino acid into the mouse eye, radioactivity appeared in the contralateral visual cortex, indicating that some material had been transferred from optic axons to lateral geniculate neurons. The radioactivity in the cortex was about 2 percent of that arriving in the geniculate, and most of it was contained in material that appeared to be protein.
The relationship between the semantic processing of words and of pictures is a matter of debate among cognitive scientists. We studied the functional anatomy of such processing by using positron-emission tomography (PET). We contrasted activity during two semantic tasks (probing knowledge of associations between concepts, and knowledge of the visual attributes of these concepts) and a baseline task (discrimination of physical stimulus size), performed either with words or with pictures. Modality-specific activations unrelated to semantic processing occurred in the left inferior parietal lobule for words, and the right middle occipital gyrus for pictures. A semantic network common to both words and pictures extended from the left superior occipital gyrus through the middle and inferior temporal cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus. A picture-specific activation related to semantic tasks occurred in the left posterior inferior temporal sulcus, and word-specific activations related to semantic tasks were localized to the left superior temporal sulcus, left anterior middle temporal gyrus, and left inferior frontal sulcus. Thus semantic tasks activate a distributed semantic processing system shared by both words and pictures, with a few specific areas differentially active for either words or pictures.
Overexpression of the polycomb group gene Bmi1 promotes cell proliferation and induces leukaemia through repression of Cdkn2a (also known as ink4a/Arf) tumour suppressors. Conversely, loss of Bmi1 leads to haematological defects and severe progressive neurological abnormalities in which de-repression of the ink4a/Arf locus is critically implicated. Here, we show that Bmi1 is strongly expressed in proliferating cerebellar precursor cells in mice and humans. Using Bmi1-null mice we demonstrate a crucial role for Bmi1 in clonal expansion of granule cell precursors both in vivo and in vitro. Deregulated proliferation of these progenitor cells, by activation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, leads to medulloblastoma development. We also demonstrate linked overexpression of BMI1 and patched (PTCH), suggestive of SHH pathway activation, in a substantial fraction of primary human medulloblastomas. Together with the rapid induction of Bmi1 expression on addition of Shh or on overexpression of the Shh target Gli1 in cerebellar granule cell cultures, these findings implicate BMI1 overexpression as an alternative or additive mechanism in the pathogenesis of medulloblastomas, and highlight a role for Bmi1-containing polycomb complexes in proliferation of cerebellar precursor cells.
The self-mobile maize transposable element Ac (Activator) displays two trans-acting genetic functions: it induces transposition of the element Ds (Dissociation) but, as its dosage is increased, it also inhibits transposition. Previous work has shown that the 4563 base pair (bp)-long Ac element contains three open reading frames (ORF's) and that a deletion in ORF 1 in wx-m9(Ds), a Ds derivative from Ac isolated at the wx (waxy) locus, results in loss of transposition. The Ds element in the bronze allele bz-m2(DI) is shown to have arisen from Ac by a 1312-bp deletion that is located almost entirely within ORF 2 and does not affect ORF 1. The Ds elements in wx-m9(Ds) and bzm2(DI), defective in ORF 1 and ORF 2, respectively, do not complement genetically to restore the transposition function of Ac; therefore, this function must be specified jointly by ORF's 1 and 2. Furthermore, since bz-m2(DI) does not contribute to Ac's inhibitory dosage effect, both Ac properties result from the expression of the same genetic functional unit.
Desensitization is a phenomenon that is common to many ligand-gated ion channels but has been demonstrated only rarely with physiological stimulation. Numerous studies describe desensitization of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor by exogenous agonists, but whether synaptic stimulation causes desensitization has been unknown. Synaptic stimulation of NMDA receptors on rat hippocampal neurons resulted in desensitization that was prevented by intracellular 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP-gamma-S), or inhibitors of phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), but not by inhibitors of phosphatases 1 and 2A or of tyrosine phosphatases. Synaptic NMDA receptors may fluctuate between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms, depending on the rate of synaptic stimulation and the magnitude of the associated influx of calcium through NMDA receptors.
A major monoaminergic innervation in infant rat neocortex, predominantly in layer IV, has been demonstrated by ultrastructural and biochemical studies after the administration of exogenous catecholamine precursors and congeners. One-third of all cortical synapses have an uptake-storage mechanism for catecholamines. In newborn cortex, the storage capacity for catecholamines is tenfold greater than the endogenous levels, and the uptake-storage mechanism matures earlier than the ability to synthesize neurotransmitter.
Patients with Alzheimer's disease or other neurodegenerative disorders show remarkable fluctuations in neurological functions, even during the same day. These fluctuations cannot be caused by sudden loss or gain of nerve cells. Instead, it is likely that they reflect variations in the activity of neural networks and, perhaps, chronic intoxication by abnormal proteins that the brain is temporarily able to overcome. These ideas have far-reaching therapeutic implications.
NF-kB is crucial for innate immune defence against microbial infection. Inhibition of NF-kB signalling has been observed with various bacterial infections. The NF-kB pathway critically requires multiple ubiquitin-chain signals of different natures. The question of whether ubiquitin-chain signalling and its specificity in NF-kB activation are regulated during infection, and how this regulation takes place, has not been explored. Here we show that human TAB2 and TAB3, ubiquitin-chain sensory proteins involved in NF-kB signalling, are directly inactivated by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli NleE, a conserved bacterial type-III-secreted effector responsible for blocking host NF-kB signalling. NleE harboured an unprecedented S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activity that specifically modified a zinc-coordinating cysteine in the Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) domains in TAB2 and TAB3. Cysteine-methylated TAB2-NZF and TAB3-NZF (truncated proteins only comprising the NZF domain) lost the zinc ion as well as the ubiquitin-chain binding activity. Ectopically expressed or type-III-secretion-system-delivered NleE methylated TAB2 and TAB3 in host cells and diminished their ubiquitin-chain binding activity. Replacement of the NZF domain of TAB3 with the NleE methylation-insensitive Npl4 NZF domain resulted in NleE-resistant NF-kB activation. Given the prevalence of zinc-finger motifs and activation of cysteine thiol by zinc binding, methylation of zinc-finger cysteine might regulate other eukaryotic pathways in addition to NF-kB signalling.
Adenosine and its analogues are potent inhibitors of synaptic activity in the central and peripheral nervous system. In the central nervous system (CNS), this appears to arise primarily by inhibition of presynaptic release of transmitters, including glutamate, which is possibly the major excitatory transmitter in the brain. In addition, postsynaptic effects of adenosine have been reported which would also serve to reduce neurotransmission. The mechanism by which adenosine inhibits CNS neurotransmission is unknown, although it appears to exert its effect via an A1 receptor which in some systems is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition, we have examined the effect of pertussis toxin (PTX) on the ability of the stable adenosine analogue (-)phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) to inhibit glutamate release from cerebellar neurones maintained in primary culture. PTX, by ADP-ribosylating the nucleotide-binding protein Ni, prevents coupling of inhibitory receptors such as the A1 receptor to adenylate cyclase. As reported here, we found that PTX, as well as preventing inhibition of adenylate cyclase by PIA, also converts the PIA-induced inhibition of glutamate release to a stimulation. Our results suggest strongly that purinergic inhibitory modulation of transmitter release occurs by inhibition of adenylate cyclase.
The movement disorder tardive dyskinesia is a serious side effect of the long-term treatment of schizophrenia with neuroleptic drugs. Similar symptoms to those of tardive dyskinesia have been observed in Cebus apella monkeys following long-term treatment with neuroleptic drugs, and these monkeys may therefore be a useful animal model of tardive dyskinesia. Motor defects have persisted in these dyskinetic monkeys for periods of 1-6 yr after the cessation of neuroleptic treatment. We report here that in three regions of the brains of dyskinetic monkeys (substantia nigra, medial globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus) glutamate decarboxylase activities and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels are reduced relative to control monkeys that had been treated with neuroleptics but which showed none of the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. These results suggest that alterations in the GABA neurone system are involved in neuroleptic drug-induced tardive dyskinesia.
gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is regarded as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of vertebrates. GABA exerts its inhibitory actions by interacting with specific receptors on pre- and postsynaptic membranes and has been shown to inhibit somatostatin release from hypothalamic neurones in vitro. Concepts of innervation of the gastrointestinal tract have been expanded by recent studies which suggest that GABAergic neurones are not confined solely to the central nervous system but may also exist in the vertebrate peripheral autonomic nervous system. Jessen and coworkers have demonstrated the presence, synthesis and uptake of GABA by the myenteric plexus of the guinea pig taenia coli, and have documented the presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in isolated myenteric plexus. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of glutamic acid to GABA in GABAergic neurones. The possibility that GABA may have a role in neurotransmission or neuromodulation in the enteric nervous system of the vertebrate gut has been suggested by several investigators. Furthermore, GABA receptors have been demonstrated on elements of the enteric nervous system. The effects of GABA on gastrointestinal endocrine cell function have not been examined. We report here the effects of GABA on gastrin and somatostatin release from isolated rat antral mucosa in short-term in vitro incubations.
Programmed cell death (apoptosis) occurs during normal development of the central nervous system. However, the mechanisms that determine which neurons will succumb to apoptosis are poorly understood. Blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors for only a few hours during late fetal or early neonatal life triggered widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain, suggesting that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, acting at NMDA receptors, controls neuronal survival. These findings may have relevance to human neurodevelopmental disorders involving prenatal (drug-abusing mothers) or postnatal (pediatric anesthesia) exposure to drugs that block NMDA receptors.
In the brains of rats without tolerance to morphine, the accumulation of [(14)C]dopamine formed from [(14)C]tyrosine injected intracisternally is increased, reaching a maximum in the hypothalamus and striatum 1 hour after administration of morphine. In tolerant rats, the rate of incorporation of carbon-14 into dopamine and into norepinephrine in these areas is more than twice that in animals that have received only one injection of morphine.
When a kitten is subjected to monocular lid suture early in life, cells in laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) connected to the sutured eye grow less than normal and cells in those laminae connected to the non-sutured eye grow more than normal. These changes are seen primarily in the binocular segment of the LGN, which corresponds to the central visual field, and are due to competition either between intracortical afferents originating from the different LGN laminae, or directly among cells within the LGN. The afferent deprivation induced by lid suture, however, is not complete, as retinal ganglion cells fire tonically both in darkness and in light. It is generally thought that this tonic retinal activity is necessary to maintain neuronal excitability at normal threshold in the central visual pathway. In the visual cortex of developing kittens, we previously showed a long-lasting change in ocular dominance of binocular cells by a brief blockade of retinal activity in one optic nerve. We report here that a complete blockade of retinal activity in one eye causes major changes in LGN cell size within 1 week. These changes occur throughout the LGN, including the monocular segment where binocular competition does not occur. The results indicate that tonic retinal activity may have an important role in the control of geniculate cell size.
Before the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, a protein complex is thought to form between VAMP--an integral membrane protein of the vesicle--and two proteins associated with the plasma membrane, SNAP-25 and syntaxin. The yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning system has now been used to identify additional proteins from Aplysia that interact directly with VAMP. A 33-kilodalton membrane protein, termed VAP-33 (VAMP-associated protein of 33 kilodaltons), was identified whose corresponding messenger RNA was detected only in the central nervous system and the gill of Aplysia. Presynaptic injection of antibodies specific for VAP-33 inhibited synaptic transmission, which suggests that VAP-33 is required for the exocytosis of neurotransmitter.
There is a long-standing controversy regarding the mechanisms that generate the functional subdivisions of the cerebral neocortex. One model proposes that thalamic axonal input specifies these subdivisions; the competing model postulates that patterning mechanisms intrinsic to the dorsal telencephalon generate neocortical regions. Gbx-2 mutant mice, whose thalamic differentiation is disrupted, were investigated. Despite the lack of cortical innervation by thalamic axons, neocortical region-specific gene expression (Cadherin-6, EphA-7, Id-2, and RZR-beta) developed normally. This provides evidence that patterning mechanisms intrinsic to the neocortex specify the basic organization of its functional subdivisions.
In presenting the neuropathology of asphyxia neonatorum and some related conditions, as illustrated in experiments with monkeys (12), I have tried to make six principal points. (i) Newborn monkeys need not be asphyxiated to the point of terminal apnea to suffer structural brain damage. Mental retardation has not been proved, but neither has it been excluded, in these monkeys. (ii) Asphyxia neonatorum requiring resuscitation of the offspring, which otherwise would die, is associated with a remarkably constant syndrome of bilaterally symmetrical, nonhemorrhagic lesions in thalamic and brain-stem nuclei, mainly those of afferent systems. The individuals in this category clearly are retarded. (iii) Asphyxia neonatorum of this second degree may be associated with postpartum complications leading to neocortical atrophy, often of considerable magnitude. The individuals are markedly retarded, often palsied, epileptic, and in a few instances even comatose. (iv) Increased intrauterine pressure in the monkey during prolonged labor leads to fetal and postpartum depression, in connection with which cerebral cortical injury occurs in the absence of typical asphyxial lesions. (v) The relationship of cerebral hemorrhages to mental retardation is not clear, but their presence at autopsy probably signifies trauma during birth, or is an agonal artifact associated with death after postpartum depression. (vi) Finally, kernicterus, a condition in which bile pigment escapes into the brain tissues from the blood when the bilirubin level is high and when there is, in combination with it, some depressing factor such as asphyxia, has been produced in the newborn monkey. It, too, is associated with mental retardation.
Several transcription factors are expressed at higher levels in the waking than in the sleeping brain. In experiments with rats, the locus coeruleus, a noradrenergic nucleus with diffuse projections, was found to regulate such expression. In brain regions depleted of noradrenergic innervation, amounts of c-Fos and nerve growth factor-induced A after waking were as low as after sleep. Phosphorylation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein was also reduced. In contrast, electroencephalographic activity was unchanged. The reduced activity of locus coeruleus neurons may explain why the induction of certain transcription factors, with potential effects on plasticity and learning, does not occur during sleep.
In Drosophila, the misexpression or altered activity of genes from the bithorax complex results in homeotic transformations. One of these genes, abd-A, normally specifies the identity of the second through fourth abdominal segments (A2 to A4). In the dominant Hyperabdominal mutations (Hab), portions of the third thoracic segment (T3) are transformed toward A2 as the result of ectopic abd-A expression. Sequence analysis and deoxyribonuclease I footprinting demonstrate that the misexpression of abd-A in two independent Hab mutations results from the same single base change in a binding site for the gap gene Kruppel protein. These results establish that the spatial limits of the homeotic genes are directly regulated by gap gene products.
The primate retina contains three classes of cones, the L, M and S cones, which respond preferentially to long-, middle- and short-wavelength visible light, respectively. Colour appearance results from neural processing of these cone signals within the retina and the brain. Perceptual experiments have identified three types of neural pathways that represent colour: a red-green pathway that signals differences between L- and M-cone responses; a blue-yellow pathway that signals differences between S-cone responses and a sum of L- and M-cone responses; and a luminance pathway that signals a sum of L- and M-cone responses. It might be expected that there are neurons in the primary visual cortex with response properties that resemble these three perceptual pathways, but attempts to find them have led to inconsistent results. We have therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine responses in the human brain to a large number of colours. In visual cortical areas V1 and V2, the strongest response is to red-green stimuli, and much of this activity is from neurons receiving opposing inputs from L and M cones. A strong response is also seen with blue-yellow stimuli, and this response declines rapidly as the temporal frequency of the stimulus is increased. These responses resemble psychophysical measurements, suggesting that colour signals relevant for perception are encoded in a large population of neurons in areas V1 and V2.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced during various electron transfer reactions in vivo, are generally considered to be deleterious to cells. In the mammalian haematopoietic system, haematopoietic stem cells contain low levels of ROS. However, unexpectedly, the common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) produce significantly increased levels of ROS(2). The functional significance of this difference in ROS level in the two progenitor types remains unresolved. Here we show that Drosophila multipotent haematopoietic progenitors, which are largely akin to the mammalian myeloid progenitors, display increased levels of ROS under in vivo physiological conditions, which are downregulated on differentiation. Scavenging the ROS from these haematopoietic progenitors by using in vivo genetic tools retards their differentiation into mature blood cells. Conversely, increasing the haematopoietic progenitor ROS beyond their basal level triggers precocious differentiation into all three mature blood cell types found in Drosophila, through a signalling pathway that involves JNK and FoxO activation as well as Polycomb downregulation. We conclude that the developmentally regulated, moderately high ROS level in the progenitor population sensitizes them to differentiation, and establishes a signalling role for ROS in the regulation of haematopoietic cell fate. Our results lead to a model that could be extended to reveal a probable signalling role for ROS in the differentiation of CMPs in mammalian haematopoietic development and oxidative stress response.
The rate of release of gamma-aminobutyric acid from the perforated pial surface of the cerebral cortex in the cat showed systematic variations with the state of activation or "arousal" of the electrocorticogram. In animals subjected to midbrain coagulation and showing constant spindle patterns characteristic of sleep, the rate of release was three times greater (about 2 micrograms per hour per square centimeter) than in animals showing a largely "aroused" electrocorticogram, which had sections of the upper cervical cord or were neuraxially intact but had been given local anesthesia. The rate of release of glutamic acid was lower in the "sleeping" animals than in "aroused" animals, while no such differences were found for glutamine and aspartic acid. Such studies may lead to a better understanding of chemical mechanisms involved in the control of states of consciousness by the brain stem.
Rats given intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine after pretreatment with pargyline become aphagic and adipsic, and show severe loss of brain catecholamines. Like rats with lateral hypothalamic lesions, these animals gradually recover ingestive behaviors, although catecholamine depletions are permanent. Both groups decrease food and water intakes markedly after the administration of alpha-methyltyrosine, at doses that do not affect the ingestive behaviors of control rats. Thus, both the loss and recovery of feeding and drinking behaviors may involve central catecholamine-containing neurons.
At the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the prion protein (PrP) can be synthesized in several topological forms. The role of these different forms was explored with transgenic mice expressing PrP mutations that alter the relative ratios of the topological forms. Expression of a particular transmembrane form (termed CtmPrP) produced neurodegenerative changes in mice similar to those of some genetic prion diseases. Brains from these mice contained CtmPrP but not PrPSc, the PrP isoform responsible for transmission of prion diseases. Furthermore, in one heritable prion disease of humans, brain tissue contained CtmPrP but not PrPSc. Thus, aberrant regulation of protein biogenesis and topology at the endoplasmic reticulum can result in neurodegeneration.
Immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) region genes are assembled in precursor B (pre-B) lymphocytes from multiple germline segments. The heavy-chain V-region gene is composed of variable (VH), diversity (D) and joining (JH) segments; kappa (K) and lambda (lambda) light-chain V-region genes have analogous VL and JL segments. Assembly of Ig V-gene segments, as well as those of the highly related T-cell receptor, is regulated at several levels and shows both stage and tissue specificity; for example Ig heavy-chain V-gene assembly precedes that of Ig light chains during B-cell differentiation. Joining of all classes of V-gene segments involves conserved recognition sequences that are probably targets for a common recombinase. Evidence has been presented suggesting that rearrangement of specific classes of segments is regulated by modulation of their accessibility to the recombinase. To elucidate mechanisms which control V-region gene assembly, we have investigated the effect of flanking gene expression on the frequency at which introduced V-gene segments are assembled in pre-B cell lines. Our findings suggest that transcription may play a direct role in the regulation of immunoglobulin V-gene assembly.
The primary role of cytokines in haemato-lymphopoiesis is thought to be the regulation of cell growth and survival. But the instructive action of cytokines in haematopoiesis has not been well addressed. Here we show that a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor, a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes (T, B and natural killer cells), can be redirected to the myeloid lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin (IL)-2 and GM-CSF (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) receptors. Analysis of mutants of the beta-chain of the IL-2 receptor revealed that the granulocyte- and monocyte-differentiation signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic domains, showing that the signalling pathway(s) responsible for these unique developmental outcomes are separable. Finally, we show that the endogenous myelomonocytic cytokine receptors for GM-CSF and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) are expressed at low to moderate levels on the more primitive haematopoietic stem cells, are absent on common lymphoid progenitors, and are upregulated after myeloid lineage induction by IL-2. We conclude that cytokine signalling can regulate cell-fate decisions and propose that a critical step in lymphoid commitment is downregulation of cytokine receptors that drive myeloid cell development.
Recurrent seizures, commonly known as epilepsies, occur in 1.7% of the general population by age 40. The factors that initiate or underlie seizures are not well understood, but trauma, infectious disease and genetics have been implicated. An understanding of the molecular basis of seizures would shed light on the basic mechanisms of neuronal homeostasis and allow new therapeutic strategies to be explored. Here, we report the mapping of an epilepsy gene to a specific chromosomal region, on the basis of cosegregation of two closely-linked DNA markers with a form of epilepsy known as benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC2, 12120 in ref. 3). The linked markers confirm the genetic basis and autosomal dominant inheritance of this trait, and localize the gene causing BFNC in this family to the long arm of chromosome 20. This regional placement is the first step towards the isolation of a gene involved in neuronal activity in the human brain.
Recent advances have uncovered the general protein apparatus used by all eukaryotes for intracellular transport, including secretion and endocytosis, and for triggered exocytosis of hormones and neurotransmitters. Membranes are shaped into vesicles by cytoplasmic coats which then dissociate upon GTP hydrolysis. Both vesicles and their acceptor membranes carry targeting proteins which interact specifically to initiate docking. A general apparatus then assembles at the docking site and fuses the vesicle with its target.
A method is described to implant a permanent indwelling polyethylene tube venting to the surface of the cerebral cortex of the dog. Morphine, amobarbital, or imipramine was administered through the tube, and behavioral changes were observed in unanesthetized and unrestrained animals. The results are different from those occurring after intraventricular injection.
Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. The ionotropic glutamate receptors are classified into two groups, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors and AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptors. The AMPA receptor is a ligand-gated cation channel that mediates the fast component of excitatory postsynaptic currents in the central nervous system. Here we report that AMPA receptors function not only as ion channels but also as cell-surface signal transducers by means of their interaction with the Src-family non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase Lyn. In the cerebellum, Lyn is physically associated with the AMPA receptor and is rapidly activated following stimulation of the receptor. Activation of Lyn is independent of Ca2+ and Na+ influx through AMPA receptors. As a result of activation of Lyn, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway is activated, and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) messenger RNA is increased in a Lyn-kinase-dependent manner. Thus, AMPA receptors generate intracellular signals from the cell surface to the nucleus through the Lyn-MAPK pathway, which may contribute to synaptic plasticity by regulating the expression of BDNF.
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), the gene product that is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, has a well-recognized function as a cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channel, but this property does not account for the abnormally high basal rate and cAMP sensitivity of sodium ion absorption in CF airway epithelia. Expression of complementary DNAs for rat epithelial Na+ channel (rENaC) alone in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells generated large amiloride-sensitive sodium currents that were stimulated by cAMP, whereas coexpression of human CFTR with rENaC generated smaller basal sodium currents that were inhibited by cAMP. Parallel studies that measured regulation of sodium permeability in fibroblasts showed similar results. In CF airway epithelia, the absence of this second function of CFTR as a cAMP-dependent regulator likely accounts for abnormal sodium transport.
Local paroxysmal discharges of epileptic tissue within the human brain, which may be electrically recorded as voltage spikes in the electroencephalogram, also generate extracranial magnetic fields. These fields were assessed by means of recently developed neuromagnetometric techniques. Surface measurements of magnetic spike field strength in the region of the focus appear sufficient to establish the location, depth, orientation, and polarity of currents underlying the paroxysmal discharge.
Platelet lysates obtained from blood of humans, dogs, and rats catalyzed the transamination of 4-aminobutyrate with 2-oxoglutarate as cosubstrate. Human platelet 4-aminobutyrate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (36.5 +/- 3.2 picomoles per minute per milligram of platelet protein) resembled the brain enzyme in kinetic properties and in response to cofactors and inhibitors.
Analogs of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) inhibit the growth of cultured cell lines. The effects of 8-bromo- and N6-butyryl-substituted analogs of cyclic and noncyclic AMP on six cell lines were examined and were equally inhibitory. Variant cell lines with altered cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase were more resistant to both cyclic and noncyclic nucleotides. We conclude that growth inhibition by analogs of cyclic AMP (i) does not require a 3',5' phosphodiester bond and (ii) may be mediated by a pathway involving endogenous cyclic AMP.
There is extensive evidence indicating that new neurons are generated in the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus, a region of the brain that is important for learning and memory. However, it is not known whether these new neurons become functional, as the methods used to study adult neurogenesis are limited to fixed tissue. We use here a retroviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein that only labels dividing cells, and that can be visualized in live hippocampal slices. We report that newly generated cells in the adult mouse hippocampus have neuronal morphology and can display passive membrane properties, action potentials and functional synaptic inputs similar to those found in mature dentate granule cells. Our findings demonstrate that newly generated cells mature into functional neurons in the adult mammalian brain.
Functional impairment of T cells is characteristic of many chronic mouse and human viral infections. The inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; also known as PDCD1), a negative regulator of activated T cells, is markedly upregulated on the surface of exhausted virus-specific CD8 T cells in mice. Blockade of this pathway using antibodies against the PD ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as CD274) restores CD8 T-cell function and reduces viral load. To investigate the role of PD-1 in a chronic human viral infection, we examined PD-1 expression on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8 T cells in 71 clade-C-infected people who were naive to anti-HIV treatments, using ten major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramers specific for frequently targeted epitopes. Here we report that PD-1 is significantly upregulated on these cells, and expression correlates with impaired HIV-specific CD8 T-cell function as well as predictors of disease progression: positively with plasma viral load and inversely with CD4 T-cell count. PD-1 expression on CD4 T cells likewise showed a positive correlation with viral load and an inverse correlation with CD4 T-cell count, and blockade of the pathway augmented HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell function. These data indicate that the immunoregulatory PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is operative during a persistent viral infection in humans, and define a reversible defect in HIV-specific T-cell function. Moreover, this pathway of reversible T-cell impairment provides a potential target for enhancing the function of exhausted T cells in chronic HIV infection.
Hydroxyurea has a differential lethal effect on cultured Chinesehamster cells that are at different stages in their cell cycle. Cells synthesizing DNA at the time of exposure to the drug are lethally damaged. Cells in the phase of growth preceding DNA synthesis (G(1)) survive but are prevented from beginning DNA synthesis. Cells in the phase after DNA synthesis (G(2)) survive and appear to progress until just before the beginning of the next period of DNA synthesis. This differential lethal and inhibitory effect of hydroxyurea may be useful for synchronizing asynchronous cell populations and explaining effects of the drug in human therapy.
The 'heavy', collagen-tailed form of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), having a s(0)20,w of 16S in mammals, occurs at vertebrate muscle endplates and has been widely regarded as a marker of neuronal influence on muscle in vivo. However, an interesting exception has been described by Bacou et al., in a previous report in Nature. They found, in a slow-twitch muscle of the rabbit, that after denervation the 16S form of AChE increases markedly, rather than disappearing. Such a phenomenon would modify current concepts of neuromuscular regulation. We report here, however, that this exception is apparent rather than real in terms of endplate AChE regulation.
Amyloid-b oligomers may cause cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease by impairing neuronal NMDA-type glutamate receptors, whose function is regulated by the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2. Here we show that amyloid-b oligomers bind to the fibronectin repeats domain of EphB2 and trigger EphB2 degradation in the proteasome. To determine the pathogenic importance of EphB2 depletions in Alzheimer's disease and related models, we used lentiviral constructs to reduce or increase neuronal expression of EphB2 in memory centres of the mouse brain. In nontransgenic mice, knockdown of EphB2 mediated by short hairpin RNA reduced NMDA receptor currents and impaired long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus, which are important for memory formation. Increasing EphB2 expression in the dentate gyrus of human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice reversed deficits in NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation and memory impairments. Thus, depletion of EphB2 is critical in amyloid-b-induced neuronal dysfunction. Increasing EphB2 levels or function could be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.
Definition of cell fates along the dorso-ventral axis depends on an antagonistic relationship between ventralizing transforming growth factor-beta superfamily members, the bone morphogenetic proteins and factors secreted from the dorsal organizer, such as Noggin and Chordin. The extracellular binding of the last group to the bone morphogenetic proteins prevents them from activating their receptors, and the relative ventralizer:antagonist ratio is thought to specify different dorso-ventral cell fates. Here, by taking advantage of a non-genetic interference method using a specific competitive inhibitor, the Lefty-related gene product Antivin, we provide evidence that cell fate along the antero-posterior axis of the zebrafish embryo is controlled by the morphogenetic activity of another transforming growth factor-beta superfamily subgroup--the Activin and Nodal-related factors. Increasing antivin doses progressively deleted posterior fates within the ectoderm, eventually resulting in the removal of all fates except forebrain and eyes. In contrast, overexpression of activin or nodal-related factors converted ectoderm that was fated to be forebrain into more posterior ectodermal or mesendodermal fates. We propose that modulation of intercellular signalling by Antivin/Activin and Nodal-related factors provides a mechanism for the graded establishment of cell fates along the antero-posterior axis of the zebrafish embryo.
Protein phosphorylation catalysed by cyclic AMP-dependent, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent and Ca2+/diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinases is important both in the modulation of synaptic transmission and in the regulation of neuronal membrane permeability (for reviews see refs 5-7). However, there has previously been no evidence for the involvement of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (cGMP-PK) in the regulation of neuronal function. Serotonin induces an increase of Ca2+ current in a group of identified ventral neurones of the snail Helix aspersa. This effect is probably mediated by cGMP because it is mimicked by the intracellular injection of cGMP or the application of zaprinast, an inhibitor of cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase. We have now found that the effect of either serotonin or zaprinast on the Ca2+ current is potentiated by the intracellular injection of cGMP-PK. Moreover, the intracellular injection of activated cGMP-PK (cGMP-PK + 1 microM cGMP) greatly enhances the Ca2+ current of the identified ventral neurones seen in the absence of serotonin. These results indicate that cGMP-PK has a physiological role in the control of the membrane permeability of these neurones.
Infant rats rewarded for crawling by being allowed to suckle on the dry nipple of an anesthetized dam showed a decreasing rate of ultrasound production during acquisition and an increasing rate during extinction. These results suggest that infant rats can be stressed and are aroused as a result of successive nonrewards just as adult rats are. In addition, these results do not support the hypothesis that infant rats lack inhibitory mechanisms related to poorly developed neural centers.
Genes associated with Hirschsprung disease, a failure to form enteric ganglia in the hindgut, were highly up-regulated in gut neural crest stem cells relative to whole-fetus RNA. One of these genes, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor Ret, was necessary for neural crest stem cell migration in the gut. GDNF promoted the migration of neural crest stem cells in culture but did not affect their survival or proliferation. Gene expression profiling, combined with reverse genetics and analyses of stem cell function, suggests that Hirschsprung disease is caused by defects in neural crest stem cell function.
The stable propagation of genetic information requires that the entire genome of an organism be faithfully replicated once and only once each cell cycle. In eukaryotes, this replication is initiated at hundreds to thousands of replication origins distributed over the genome, each of which must be prohibited from re-initiating DNA replication within every cell cycle. How cells prevent re-initiation has been a long-standing question in cell biology. In several eukaryotes, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have been implicated in promoting the block to re-initiation, but exactly how they perform this function is unclear. Here we show that B-type CDKs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae prevent re-initiation through multiple overlapping mechanisms, including phosphorylation of the origin recognition complex (ORC), downregulation of Cdc6 activity, and nuclear exclusion of the Mcm2-7 complex. Only when all three inhibitory pathways are disrupted do origins re-initiate DNA replication in G2/M cells. These studies show that each of these three independent mechanisms of regulation is functionally important.
The capacity to predict future events permits a creature to detect, model, and manipulate the causal structure of its interactions with its environment. Behavioral experiments suggest that learning is driven by changes in the expectations about future salient events such as rewards and punishments. Physiological work has recently complemented these studies by identifying dopaminergic neurons in the primate whose fluctuating output apparently signals changes or errors in the predictions of future salient and rewarding events. Taken together, these findings can be understood through quantitative theories of adaptive optimizing control.
Sensory experience begins when neural circuits in the cerebral cortex are still immature; however, the contribution of experience to cortical maturation remains unclear. In the visual cortex, the selectivity of neurons for oriented stimuli at the time of eye opening is poor and increases dramatically after the onset of visual experience. Here we investigate whether visual experience has a significant role in the maturation of orientation selectivity and underlying cortical circuits using two forms of deprivation: dark rearing, which completely eliminates experience, and binocular lid suture, which alters the pattern of sensory driven activity. Orientation maps were present in dark-reared ferrets, but fully mature levels of tuning were never attained. In contrast, only rudimentary levels of orientation selectivity were observed in lid-sutured ferrets. Despite these differences, horizontal connections in both groups were less extensive and less clustered than normal, suggesting that long-range cortical processing is not essential for the expression of orientation selectivity, but may be needed for the full maturation of tuning. Thus, experience is beneficial or highly detrimental to cortical maturation, depending on the pattern of sensory driven activity.
When the food intake of organisms such as yeast and rodents is reduced (dietary restriction), they live longer than organisms fed a normal diet. A similar effect is seen when the activity of nutrient-sensing pathways is reduced by mutations or chemical inhibitors. In rodents, both dietary restriction and decreased nutrient-sensing pathway activity can lower the incidence of age-related loss of function and disease, including tumors and neurodegeneration. Dietary restriction also increases life span and protects against diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease in rhesus monkeys, and in humans it causes changes that protect against these age-related pathologies. Tumors and diabetes are also uncommon in humans with mutations in the growth hormone receptor, and natural genetic variants in nutrient-sensing pathways are associated with increased human life span. Dietary restriction and reduced activity of nutrient-sensing pathways may thus slow aging by similar mechanisms, which have been conserved during evolution. We discuss these findings and their potential application to prevention of age-related disease and promotion of healthy aging in humans, and the challenge of possible negative side effects.
Antithrombin, a member of the serpin family, functions as an inhibitor of thrombin and other enzymes. Cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal loop of antithrombin induces a conformational change in the molecule. Here it is shown that the cleaved conformation of antithrombin has potent antiangiogenic and antitumor activity in mouse models. The latent form of intact antithrombin, which is similar in conformation to the cleaved molecule, also inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth. These data provide further evidence that the clotting and fibrinolytic pathways are directly involved in the regulation of angiogenesis.
Output from the circadian clock controls rhythmic behavior through poorly understood mechanisms. In Drosophila, null mutations of the neurofibromatosis-1 (Nf1) gene produce abnormalities of circadian rhythms in locomotor activity. Mutant flies show normal oscillations of the clock genes period (per) and timeless (tim) and of their corresponding proteins, but altered oscillations and levels of a clock-controlled reporter. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity is increased in Nf1 mutants, and the circadian phenotype is rescued by loss-of-function mutations in the Ras/MAPK pathway. Thus, Nf1 signals through Ras/MAPK in Drosophila. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a circadian oscillation of phospho-MAPK in the vicinity of nerve terminals containing pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), a secreted output from clock cells, suggesting a coupling of PDF to Ras/MAPK signaling.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent polypeptide mitogen originally isolated from the adult male mouse submaxillary gland. It also acts as a gastrointestinal hormone. EGF-immunoreactive material has recently been identified within neuronal fibers and terminals in rodent brain. In the present study, EGF was found to enhance survival and process outgrowth of primary cultures of subneocortical telencephalic neurons of neonatal rat brain in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was observed with EGF concentrations as low as 100 picograms per milliliter (0.016 nanomolar) and was dependent on the continuous presence of EGF in the medium. Similar effects were observed with basic fibroblast growth factor, but several other growth-promoting substances, including other mitogens for glial elements, were without effect. Thus EGF, in addition to its mitogenic and hormonal activities, may act as a neurite elongation and maintenance factor for select neurons of the rodent central nervous system.
In the olfactory bulb, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines, is expressed after birth when the axons of olfactory epithelial neurons have made synapses in the bulb. It has been suggested that expression of TH is regulated trans-synaptically because on deafferentation of the bulb there is a marked decrease in the contents of TH, dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, which, however, return to normal levels after regeneration of the primary afferents. To date the molecular signalling involved in this trans-synaptic induction has not yet been characterized; I have therefore studied the expression of dopaminergic properties (presence of TH and dopamine uptake) in dissociated cell cultures from embryonic mouse olfactory bulb. I report that the number of dopaminergic cells increases fivefold when olfactory bulb neurons are co-cultured with olfactory epithelial neurons and that soluble factors, rather than cell interactions, mediate this effect. The dopaminergic-inducing factor is the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) which is present in chemosensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium and when added at nanomolar concentrations to olfactory bulb cultures mimics the effect of olfactory epithelial neurons. Significantly the induction of dopaminergic phenotypes brought about by olfactory epithelial neurons is abolished by an antiserum to CGRP. These observations show that CGRP is involved in the differentiation of dopaminergic olfactory bulb neurons.
Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has a variety of effects on different cell types in vitro, inhibiting the differentiation of embryonic stem cells and promoting the survival and/or proliferation of primitive haematopoietic precursors and primordial germ cells. Here we show that LIF-deficient mice derived by gene targeting techniques have dramatically decreased numbers of stem cells in spleen and bone marrow. Injection of spleen and marrow cells from these mice promotes long-term survival of lethally irradiated wild-type animals, however, showing that the LIF- stem cells remain pluripotent. The numbers of committed progenitors are also reduced in the spleen but not the bone marrow, suggesting that stem cells interact differently with the splenic and medullary microenvironment. Heterozygous animals are intermediate in phenotype, implying that LIF has a dosage effect, and defects in stem cell number can be compensated by exogenous LIF. LIF thus appears to be required for the survival of the normal pool of stem cells, but not their terminal differentiation.
The primate visual system is often divided into two channels, designated M and P, whose signals are relayed to the cerebral cortex by neurons in the magnocellular and parvicellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. We have identified a third population of geniculocortical neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of macaques, which is immunoreactive for the alpha subunit of type II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. This large third population occupies interlaminar regions (intercalated layers) ventral to each principal layer. Retrograde labeling of kinase-immunoreactive cells from the primary visual cortex shows that they provide the geniculocortical input to cytochrome oxidase-rich puffs in layers II and III.
The agent responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) is thought to be a malfolded, protease-resistant version (PrPres) of the normal cellular prion protein (PrP). The interspecies transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to mice was studied. Although all of the mice injected with homogenate from BSE-infected cattle brain exhibited neurological symptoms and neuronal death, more than 55 percent had no detectable PrPres. During serial passage, PrPres appeared after the agent became adapted to the new host. Thus, PrPres may be involved in species adaptation, but a further unidentified agent may actually transmit BSE.
Neuronal excitotoxicity during stroke is caused by activation of unidentified large-conductance channels, leading to swelling and calcium dysregulation. We show that ischemic-like conditions [O(2)/glucose deprivation (OGD)] open hemichannels, or half gap junctions, in neurons. Hemichannel opening was indicated by a large linear current and flux across the membrane of small fluorescent molecules. Single-channel openings of hemichannels (530 picosiemens) were observed in OGD. Both the current and dye flux were blocked by inhibitors of hemichannels. Therefore, hemichannel opening contributes to the profound ionic dysregulation during stroke and may be a ubiquitous component of ischemic neuronal death.
Administration of 6-hydroxydopamine to neonatal rats produces a rapid and profound depletion of brain dopamine. Total activity of treated animals is significantly greater than that of controls between 12 and 22 days of age, but then declines, an activity pattern similar to that seen in affected children. This suggests a functional deficiency of brain dopamine in the pathogenesis of minimal brain dysfunction.
Actinomycin D and thyroxine interact in solution (pH 8 to 10), as revealed by changes in the absorbance of actinomycin D. Thyroxine can prevent the growth-inhibitory effect of actinomycin D on Bacillus subtilis if it is present in a molar ratio of 3000 (thyroxine to actinomycin D).
Electrophysiological studies indicate the existence of several types of receptors for excitatory amino acids. Thus, responses induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) are potently and selectively blocked by D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), while responses induced by such agonists as kainate and quisqualate are relatively resistant to this antagonist. Evidence is mounting that excitatory amino acid receptors are involved in synaptic excitation in many regions of the central nervous system (see refs 1 and 4 for reviews). Although the identity of the transmitter(s) acting at these receptors remains uncertain, L-aspartate has been considered the most likely transmitter at NMDA receptors and L-glutamate at kainate/quisqualate receptors. Other endogenous acidic amino acids proposed as possible transmitters include a range of sulphur-containing amino acids and the tryptophan metabolite, quinolinic acid. Ligand-binding studies offer a means not only of assessing receptor densities in different brain regions but also of comparing affinities of transmitter candidates for these receptors. However, to avoid difficulties of interpretation arising from the use of ligands which bind to more than one type of receptor, such as [3H]-L-glutamate and [3H]-L-aspartate (for example, refs 8-12), ligands with high receptor selectivity are required. Here, we report that [3H]-D-AP5 binds specifically to rat brain membranes, that the hippocampus and cerebral cortex are enriched in these sites relative to other brain areas and that L-glutamate has higher affinity for these receptors than have all other transmitter candidates tested.
The tertiary analogute of phospholine, namely, (C(2)H(5)O)(2)P(O)SCH(2)CH(2)N(CH(3))(2), is a potent, irreversible inhibitor of cholinesterase which, when externally applied to the sqluid giant axon, readily penetrates in its inhibitory form into the axoplasm. However, even a 10(-2) molar solution of this compound does not block axonal conduction unless the axon is first treated with a low concentration of venom from the cottonmouth moccasin. The question of the activity of acetylcholinesterase in these axons is considered, and the possibility of subcellular permeability barriers for indivisual components of the excitable membrane is discussed.
Deposition of amyoid-beta peptide in the central nervous system is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and a possible cause of neurodegeneration. The factors that initiate or promote deposition of amyloid-beta peptide are not known. The transforming growth factor TGF-beta1 plays a central role in the response of the brain to injury, and increased TGF-beta1 has been found in the central nervous system of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Here we report that TGF-beta1 induces amyloid-beta deposition in cerebral blood vessels and meninges of aged transgenic mice overexpressing this cytokine from astrocytes. Co-expression of TGF-beta1 in transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid-precursor protein, which develop Alzheimer's like pathology, accelerated the deposition of amyloid-beta peptide. More TGF-beta1 messenger RNA was present in post-mortem brain tissue of Alzheimer's patients than in controls, the levels correlating strongly with amyloid-beta deposition in the damaged cerebral blood vessels of patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These results indicate that overexpression of TGF-beta1 may initiate or promote amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease and in experimental models and so may be a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease.
In budding yeast many genes are expressed under cell-cycle control in late G1. These include a large group of DNA synthesis genes, the HO gene involved in mating-type switching, CTS1 (chitinase) and also CLN1 and CLN2 (ref. 4) encoding G1 cyclins. Two factors, encoded by the SWI4 and SWI6 genes, are required for HO (ref. 5), CLN (refs 6, 7) and CTS1 (ref. 3) gene expression and, at least in the HO promoter, bind to CACGA4 upstream sequences (CCBs). This motif is not found upstream of the DNA synthesis genes, which instead have a hexamer element, ACGCGT1 (MCB), an MluI restriction site, that is recognized by a cell-cycle regulated transcription complex DSC1 (ref. 1). This MluI-activation system consisting of the MCBs and DSC1 is conserved in fission yeast where a DSC1-like complex controls the cdc22+ ribonucleotide reductase gene. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc10+ gene encodes a component of DSC1 (ref. 10) and, significantly, this has homology with both the Swi4 and Swi6 proteins. Here we show that Swi6 is an essential component of DSC1 and that deletion of SWI6 impairs the cell-cycle regulation of the DNA synthesis genes, as well as CLN1 and CLN2. Thus Swi6 is the common factor in regulation of all the above genes and may therefore be responsible for the timing of their expression in late G1.
Arguments are presented for the hypothesis that during an early stage of development the cells which become principal neurons of the autonomic nervous system possess information regarding the positions they will occupy within the body. A second stage of development, during which a decision is made regarding which neurotransmitter to employ, is delayed until each neuron has assumed its permanent position in the body and has sampled, presumably via its growing axons, the peripheral field which it will innervate. The development of cholinergic mechanisms takes precedence; adrenergic neurons may develop only when cholinergic sites have been occupied. An extended period during which the differentiation of transmitter mechanisms may be modulated permits the neuron to adequately sample the periphery prior to commitment to a specific transmitter economy.
Transcriptional feedback loops constitute the molecular circuitry of the plant circadian clock. In Arabidopsis, a core loop is established between CCA1 and TOC1. Although CCA1 directly represses TOC1, the TOC1 protein has no DNA binding domains, which suggests that it cannot directly regulate CCA1. We established a functional genomic strategy that led to the identification of CHE, a TCP transcription factor that binds specifically to the CCA1 promoter. CHE is a clock component partially redundant with LHY in the repression of CCA1. The expression of CHE is regulated by CCA1, thus adding a CCA1/CHE feedback loop to the Arabidopsis circadian network. Because CHE and TOC1 interact, and CHE binds to the CCA1 promoter, a molecular linkage between TOC1 and CCA1 gene regulation is established.
Mouse tumors induced by gamma radiation are a useful model system for oncogenesis. DNA from such tumors contains an activated K-ras oncogene that can transform NIH 3T3 cells. This report describes the cloning of a fragment of the mouse K-ras oncogene containing the first exon from both a transformant in rat-2 cells and the brain of the same mouse that developed the tumor. Hybrid constructs containing one of the two pieces were made and only the plasmid including the first exon from the transformant gave rise to foci in NIH 3T3 cells. There was only a single base difference (G----A) in the exonic sequence, which changed glycine to aspartic acid in the transformant. By use of a synthetic oligonucleotide the presence of the mutation was demonstrated in the original tumor, ruling out modifications during DNA-mediated gene transfer and indicating that the alteration was present in the thymic lymphoma but absent from other nonmalignant tissue. The results are compatible with gamma radiation being a source of point mutations.
Synaptic transmission of most vertebrate synapses is thought to be terminated by rapid transport of the neurotransmitter into presynaptic nerve terminals or neuroglia. L-Glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter in brain and its transport represents the mechanism by which it is removed from the synaptic cleft and kept below toxic levels. Here we use an antibody against a glial L-glutamate transporter from rat brain to isolate a complementary DNA clone encoding this transporter. Expression of this cDNA in transfected HeLa cells indicates that L-glutamate accumulation requires external sodium and internal potassium and transport shows the expected stereospecificity. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 573 amino acids with 8-9 putative transmembrane alpha-helices. Database searches indicate that this protein is not homologous to any identified protein of mammalian origin, including the recently described superfamily of neurotransmitter transporters. This protein therefore seems to be a member of a new family of transport molecules.
Delta oscillations, characteristic of the electroencephalogram (EEG) of slow wave sleep, estimate sleep depth and need and are thought to be closely linked to the recovery function of sleep. The cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of delta waves at the cortical and thalamic levels are well documented, but the molecular regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here we demonstrate in the mouse that the gene encoding the retinoic acid receptor beta determines the contribution of delta oscillations to the sleep EEG. Thus, retinoic acid signaling, which is involved in the patterning of the brain and dopaminergic pathways, regulates cortical synchrony in the adult.
Golgi-stained dendrites of single randomly chosen layer-II pyramidal neurons in the human parahippocampal gyrus were quantified with a computer-microscope system. In nondemented aged cases (average age, 79.6 years), dendritic trees were more extensive than in adult cases (average age, 51.2), with most of the difference resulting from increases in the number and average length of terminal segments of the dendritic tree. These results provide morphological evidence for plasticity in the mature and aged human brain. In senile dementia (average age, 76.0), dendritic trees were less extensive than in adult brains, largely because their terminal segments were fewer and shorter. Cells with shrunken dendritic trees were found in all brains. These data suggest a model of aging in the central nervous system in which one population of neurons dies and regresses and the other survives and grows. The latter appears to be the dominant population in aging without dementia.
Some animals have larger brains than others, but it is not yet known why. Species differences in life-style, including dietary habits and patterns of development of the young, are associated with variation in brain weight, independently of the effects of body weight and evolutionary history. Taken together with behavioral and neuroanatomical analyses, these studies begin to suggest the evolutionary pressures that favor different sized brains and brain components.
Errors in the identification of objects have been made frequently because of faulty interpretation of their flat images or sections. Such errors are perpetuated through a strange psychological chain reaction. 1) The first author who observes sections of an object, although presenting faithful pictures of sections of it, identifies its shape incorrectly. Such an initial mistake may be due to identification of the flat image with the object itself or to failure to consider the shape of the image as a function of the shape of the real object and the angle and level of cutting. 2) The first author describes verbally his personal concept of the object. 3) The reader reads the text of a publication before or without examining the pictorial evidence. 4) The reader's belief in the authority of the printed word immunizes him against critical evaluation of the evidence. 5) The reader regards a published opinion as a "fact." 6) A mechanism of suppression of new evidence is set up in the brain of the reader in favor of previously published, verbalized concepts. His brain unconsciously rejects new concepts that might arise intracerebrally. The printed word supersedes visual evidence. 7) A secondary mechanism parallels steps 3 to 6. An observer notices an unfamiliar figure in the microscope. Following established procedures for scientific investigations, he refrains from forming an opinion about his observation. Instead he rushes to the library searching for similar, published observations. If he finds a previous report about a similar shape, he accepts it as a "fact" and he "confirms" the previously printed viewpoint. Let me interject a personal experience concerning this mechanism. I investigated the arrangement of blood vessels in the human liver by means of corrosion preparations. The work was divided between an assistant and me. He was assigned the task of preparing drawings of two specimens. In his drawings he showed a structure which was absent from the specimens but had been described in a previous publication. This article shows simple ways for correct initial identification of shape and structure and for the breaking of the reverberating circuit of erroneous thinking.
Hemagglutination of turkey erythrocytes by Mycoplasma gallisepticum was inhibited by mucoproteins containing sialic acid, by sialic acid itself, and by treatment of the erythrocytes with neuraminidase. Neuraminidase treatment of the mucoprotein-rich inhibitors reduced or abolished their inhibitory activity. The findings indicate that sialic acid on the erythrocyte surface provides binding sites for Mycoplasma gallisepticum.
The orphan receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (also known as HER2 or Neu) transforms cells when overexpressed, and it is an important therapeutic target in human cancer. Structural studies have suggested that the oncogenic (and ligand-independent) signalling properties of ErbB2 result from the absence of a key intramolecular 'tether' in the extracellular region that autoinhibits other human ErbB receptors, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Although ErbB2 is unique among the four human ErbB receptors, here we show that it is the closest structural relative of the single EGF receptor family member in Drosophila melanogaster (dEGFR). Genetic and biochemical data show that dEGFR is tightly regulated by growth factor ligands, yet a crystal structure shows that it, too, lacks the intramolecular tether seen in human EGFR, ErbB3 and ErbB4. Instead, a distinct set of autoinhibitory interdomain interactions hold unliganded dEGFR in an inactive state. All of these interactions are maintained (and even extended) in ErbB2, arguing against the suggestion that ErbB2 lacks autoinhibition. We therefore suggest that normal and pathogenic ErbB2 signalling may be regulated by ligands in the same way as dEGFR. Our findings have important implications for ErbB2 regulation in human cancer, and for developing therapeutic approaches that target novel aspects of this orphan receptor.
Nerve growth factor (NGF) is essential for the survival of both peripheral ganglion cells and central cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. The accelerated loss of central cholinergic neurons during Alzheimer's disease may be a determinant of dementia in these patients and may therefore suggest a therapeutic role for NGF. However, NGF does not significantly penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which makes its clinical utility dependent on invasive neurosurgical procedures. When conjugated to an antibody to the transferrin receptor, however, NGF crossed the blood-brain barrier after peripheral injection. This conjugated NGF increased the survival of both cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons of the medial septal nucleus that had been transplanted into the anterior chamber of the rat eye. This approach may prove useful for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders that are amenable to treatment by proteins that do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.
The physical changes representing a memory are believed to be localized to specific neurons, widely distributed in multiple parallel pathways in the brain. 2-Fluorodeoxyglucose, labeled with two discriminable radioactive tracers, was used to construct quantitative metabolic maps in split-brain cats during a visual task. One side of the brain served to estimate the metabolic variability of nonspecific influences. The other side was used to map metabolic changes related to the presence of previously learned visual cues, as well as changes related to nonspecific influences, in the same periods of time. When the two sides were compared, between 5 million and 100 million neurons (depending upon the significance level selected) were identified in which activity increased during presentation of the familiar cues. The wide distribution of these neurons throughout the brain is compatible with prior evidence of a distributed memory system. However, the large number of neurons involved is difficult to reconcile with theories in which individual neurons are dedicated to specific memories.
Direct stimulation of the pyramidal tract increases the size of the excitatory receptive fields of neurons in the somatosensory cortex of the cat. This effect reflects greater transmission of cutaneous information through the dorsal column nuclei as a result of the facilitation of cells in these nuclei by pyramidal tract fibers.
Nicotine exerts antinociceptive effects by interacting with one or more of the subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that are present throughout the neuronal pathways that respond to pain. To identify the particular subunits involved in this process, we generated mice lacking the alpha4 subunit of the neuronal nAChR by homologous recombination techniques and studied these together with previously generated mutant mice lacking the beta2 nAChR subunit. Here we show that the homozygous alpha4-/- mice no longer express high-affinity [3H]nicotine and [3H]epibatidine binding sites throughout the brain. In addition, both types of mutant mice display a reduced antinociceptive effect of nicotine on the hot-plate test and diminished sensitivity to nicotine in the tail-flick test. Patch-clamp recordings further reveal that raphe magnus and thalamic neurons no longer respond to nicotine. The alpha4 nAChR subunit, possibly associated with the beta2 nAChR subunit, is therefore crucial for nicotine-elicited antinociception.
Despite the high prevalence and poor outcome of patients with metastatic lung cancer the mechanisms of tumour progression and metastasis remain largely uncharacterized. Here we modelled human lung adenocarcinoma, which frequently harbours activating point mutations in KRAS and inactivation of the p53 pathway, using conditional alleles in mice. Lentiviral-mediated somatic activation of oncogenic Kras and deletion of p53 in the lung epithelial cells of Kras(LSL-G12D/+);p53(flox/flox) mice initiates lung adenocarcinoma development. Although tumours are initiated synchronously by defined genetic alterations, only a subset becomes malignant, indicating that disease progression requires additional alterations. Identification of the lentiviral integration sites allowed us to distinguish metastatic from non-metastatic tumours and determine the gene expression alterations that distinguish these tumour types. Cross-species analysis identified the NK2-related homeobox transcription factor Nkx2-1 (also called Ttf-1 or Titf1) as a candidate suppressor of malignant progression. In this mouse model, Nkx2-1 negativity is pathognomonic of high-grade poorly differentiated tumours. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cells derived from metastatic and non-metastatic tumours demonstrated that Nkx2-1 controls tumour differentiation and limits metastatic potential in vivo. Interrogation of Nkx2-1-regulated genes, analysis of tumours at defined developmental stages, and functional complementation experiments indicate that Nkx2-1 constrains tumours in part by repressing the embryonically restricted chromatin regulator Hmga2. Whereas focal amplification of NKX2-1 in a fraction of human lung adenocarcinomas has focused attention on its oncogenic function, our data specifically link Nkx2-1 downregulation to loss of differentiation, enhanced tumour seeding ability and increased metastatic proclivity. Thus, the oncogenic and suppressive functions of Nkx2-1 in the same tumour type substantiate its role as a dual function lineage factor.
In layer 4 of cat visual cortex, the monocular, concentric receptive fields of thalamic neurons, which relay retinal input to the cortex, are transformed into 'simple' cortical receptive fields that are binocular and selective for the precise orientation, direction of motion, and size of the visual stimulus. These properties are thought to arise from the pattern of connections from thalamic neurons, although anatomical studies show that most excitatory inputs to layer 4 simple cells are from recurrently connected circuits of cortical neurons. We examined single fibre inputs to spiny stellate neurons. We examined single fibre inputs to spiny stellate neurons in slices of cat visual cortex, and conclude that thalamocortical synapses are powerful and the responses they evoke are unusually invariant for central synapses. However, the responses to intracortical inputs, although less invariant, are strong enough to provide most of the excitation to simple cells in vivo. Our results suggest that the recurrent excitatory circuits of cortex may amplify the initial feedforward thalamic signal, subserving dynamic modifications of the functional properties of cortical neurons.
Bacteria have developed mechanisms to communicate and compete with one another in diverse environments. A new form of intercellular communication, contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI), was discovered recently in Escherichia coli. CDI is mediated by the CdiB/CdiA two-partner secretion (TPS) system. CdiB facilitates secretion of the CdiA 'exoprotein' onto the cell surface. An additional small immunity protein (CdiI) protects CDI(+) cells from autoinhibition. The mechanisms by which CDI blocks cell growth and by which CdiI counteracts this growth arrest are unknown. Moreover, the existence of CDI activity in other bacteria has not been explored. Here we show that the CDI growth inhibitory activity resides within the carboxy-terminal region of CdiA (CdiA-CT), and that CdiI binds and inactivates cognate CdiA-CT, but not heterologous CdiA-CT. Bioinformatic and experimental analyses show that multiple bacterial species encode functional CDI systems with high sequence variability in the CdiA-CT and CdiI coding regions. CdiA-CT heterogeneity implies that a range of toxic activities are used during CDI. Indeed, CdiA-CTs from uropathogenic E. coli and the plant pathogen Dickeya dadantii have different nuclease activities, each providing a distinct mechanism of growth inhibition. Finally, we show that bacteria lacking the CdiA-CT and CdiI coding regions are unable to compete with isogenic wild-type CDI(+) cells both in laboratory media and on a eukaryotic host. Taken together, these results suggest that CDI systems constitute an intricate immunity network with an important function in bacterial competition.
Understanding inter-individual differences in stress response requires the explanation of genetic influences at multiple phenotypic levels, including complex behaviours and the metabolic responses of brain regions to emotional stimuli. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is anxiolytic and its release is induced by stress. NPY is abundantly expressed in regions of the limbic system that are implicated in arousal and in the assignment of emotional valences to stimuli and memories. Here we show that haplotype-driven NPY expression predicts brain responses to emotional and stress challenges and also inversely correlates with trait anxiety. NPY haplotypes predicted levels of NPY messenger RNA in post-mortem brain and lymphoblasts, and levels of plasma NPY. Lower haplotype-driven NPY expression predicted higher emotion-induced activation of the amygdala, as well as diminished resiliency as assessed by pain/stress-induced activations of endogenous opioid neurotransmission in various brain regions. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs16147) located in the promoter region alters NPY expression in vitro and seems to account for more than half of the variation in expression in vivo. These convergent findings are consistent with the function of NPY as an anxiolytic peptide and help to explain inter-individual variation in resiliency to stress, a risk factor for many diseases.
Progression of the cell cycle and control of apoptosis (programmed cell death) are thought to be intimately linked processes, acting to preserve homeostasis and developmental morphogenesis. Although proteins that regulate apoptosis have been implicated in restraining cell-cycle entry and controlling ploidy (chromosome number), the effector molecules at the interface between cell proliferation and cell survival have remained elusive. Here we show that a new inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein, survivin, is expressed in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in a cycle-regulated manner. At the beginning of mitosis, survivin associates with microtubules of the mitotic spindle in a specific and saturable reaction that is regulated by microtubule dynamics. Disruption of survivin-microtubule interactions results in loss of survivin's anti-apoptosis function and increased caspase-3 activity, a mechanism involved in cell death, during mitosis. These results indicate that survivin may counteract a default induction of apoptosis in G2/M phase. The overexpression of survivin in cancer may overcome this apoptotic checkpoint and favour aberrant progression of transformed cells through mitosis.
In Alzheimer's disease (AD) there are dramatic reductions in the content of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), reciprocal increases in CRF receptors, and morphological abnormalities in CRF neurons in affected brain areas. Cognitive impairment in AD patients is associated with a lower cerebrospinal fluid concentration of CRF, which is known to induce increases in learning and memory in rodents. This suggests that CRF deficits contribute to cognitive impairment. The identification in post-mortem brain of CRF-binding protein (CRF-BP), a high-affinity binding protein that inactivates CRF, and the differential distribution of CRF-BP and CRF receptors, provides the potential for improving learning and memory without stress effects of CRF receptor agonists. Here we show that ligands that dissociate CRF from CRF-BP increase brain levels of 'free CRF' in AD to control levels and show cognition-enhancing properties in models of learning and memory in animals without the characteristic stress effects of CRF receptor agonists.
The growth in vitro of human breast cancer cells, line MCF-7, was inhibited by a daily supplement of L-arginine (1 milligram per milliliter). Arginine acted synergistically with dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) (10(-6) molar) to enhance the growth inhibitory effect: the cell replication ceased completely within 2 days after treatment. The growth arrest accompanied a change in cell morphology and was preceded by increases in the cellular concentration of cyclic AMP, adenylate cyclase, and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activities as well as a decrease of estrogen binding activity. The results suggest that growth of human breast cancer cells is subject to cyclic AMP-mediated regulation and that arginine may play a specific role in this process.
Potent anticoagulants have been derived by targeting the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex with naive peptide libraries displayed on M13 phage. The peptides specifically block the activation of factor X with a median inhibitory concentration of 1 nM and selectively inhibit tissue-factor-dependent clotting. The peptides do not bind to the active site of factor VIIa; rather, they work by binding to an exosite on the factor VIIa protease domain, and non-competitively inhibit activation of factor X and amidolytic activity. One such peptide (E-76) has a well defined structure in solution determined by NMR spectroscopy that is similar to the X-ray crystal structure when complexed with factor VIIa. These structural and functional studies indicate an allosteric 'switch' mechanism of inhibition involving an activation loop of factor VIIa and represent a new framework for developing inhibitors of serine proteases.
Tetrodotoxin (3 x 10(-8) molar) promoted the release of thiamine from perfused rat and frog nerve preparations in a manner similar to other neuroactive drugs. When the rats were injected with thiamine labeled with sulfur-35, analyses of brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve homogenates revealed labeled thiamine in membrane, synaptosomes, and mitochondrial subfractions. However, on incubation of these fractions with tetrodotoxin, thiamine was released only from the membrane fragments.
By electrocoagulation of the thalamic posterior commissure, the electroencephalographic arousal by high frequency stimulation of the thalamic unspecific nuclei was prevented, whereas the synchronizing influence on the cerebral cortex remained intact. On this ground, the role of the "thalamic reticular system" in the control of the cerebral rhythms is discussed.
Either L-dopa, in combination with 1-alpha-methyldopa hydrazine (MK-486), or 1-(2''-pyrimidyl)-4-piperonylpiperazine, an agent that stimulates dopamine receptors, relieves surgically induced tremor in monkeys and concomitantly evokes involuntary movements. These results indicate that tremor and involuntary movements are associated with a common mechanism and that the activity of the dopamine receptors is involved in the regulation of these dysfunctions.
Bidirectional changes in the efficacy of neuronal synaptic transmission, such as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), are thought to be mechanisms for information storage in the brain. LTP and LTD may be mediated by the modulation of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazloe proprionic acid) receptor phosphorylation. Here we show that LTP and LTD reversibly modify the phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit. However, contrary to the hypothesis that LTP and LTD are the functional inverse of each other, we find that they are associated with phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively, of distinct GluR1 phosphorylation sites. Moreover, the site modulated depends on the stimulation history of the synapse. LTD induction in naive synapses dephosphorylates the major cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) site, whereas in potentiated synapses the major calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) site is dephosphorylated. Conversely, LTP induction in naive synapses and depressed synapses increases phosphorylation of the CaMKII site and the PKA site, respectively. LTP is differentially sensitive to CaMKII and PKA inhibitors depending on the history of the synapse. These results indicate that AMPA receptor phosphorylation is critical for synaptic plasticity, and that identical stimulation conditions recruit different signal-transduction pathways depending on synaptic history.
Just-noticeable differences of physical parameters are often limited by the resolution of the peripheral sensory apparatus. Thus, two-point discrimination in vision is limited by the size of individual photoreceptors. Frequency selectivity is a basic property of neurons in the mammalian auditory pathway. However, just-noticeable differences of frequency are substantially smaller than the bandwidth of the peripheral sensors. Here we report that frequency tuning in single neurons recorded from human auditory cortex in response to random-chord stimuli is far narrower than that typically described in any other mammalian species (besides bats), and substantially exceeds that attributed to the human auditory periphery. Interestingly, simple spectral filter models failed to predict the neuronal responses to natural stimuli, including speech and music. Thus, natural sounds engage additional processing mechanisms beyond the exquisite frequency tuning probed by the random-chord stimuli.
The inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing (GABAergic) neurons of the thalamic reticular and perigeniculate nuclei are involved in the generation of normal and abnormal synchronized activity in thalamocortical networks. An important factor controlling the generation of activity in this system is the amplitude and duration of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in thalamocortical cells, which depend on the pattern of activity generated in thalamic reticular and perigeniculate cells. Activation of single ferret perigeniculate neurons generated three distinct patterns of GABAergic IPSPs in thalamocortical neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus: Low-frequency tonic discharge resulted in small-amplitude IPSPs mediated by GABAA receptors, burst firing resulted in large-amplitude GABAA IPSPs, and prolonged burst firing activated IPSPs mediated by GABAA and GABAB receptors. These functional properties of GABAergic inhibition can reconfigure the operations of thalamocortical networks into patterns of activity associated with waking, slow-wave sleep, and generalized seizures.
Animals with a history of receiving daily injections of +-amphetamine in a specific environment showed a placebo effect (enhanced activity) when injected with saline and placed there; control animals with similar but dissociated drug histories and experience with the test chamber failed to show the effect. The dopamine receptor blocker pimozide antagonized the establishment of conditioning. However, the same dose of pimozide, when given to previously conditioned animals on the placebo test day, failed to antagonize the expression of conditioned activity. Thus, during conditioning dopaminergic neurons mediated a change that subsequently influenced behavior even when dopaminergic systems were blocked. Although schizophrenia may be related to hyperfunctioning of dopamine, neuroleptic drugs, which block dopamine receptors on their first administration, do not have therapeutic effects for a number of days. The results of the pimozide experiments may resolve this paradox.
Estimates of IQ heritability are subject to a variety of systematic errors. The IQ scores themselves contain uncontrollable, systematic errors of unknown magnitude. These arise because IQ scores, unlike conventional physical and biological measurements, have a purely instrumental definition. The effects of these errors are apparent in the very large discrepancies among IQ correlations measured by different investigators. Genotype-environment correlations, whose effects can sometimes be minimized, if not wholly eliminated, in experiments with plants and animals, are nearly always important in human populations. The absence of significant effects arising from genotype-environment correlations is a necessary condition for the applicability of conventional heritability analysis to phenotypically plastic traits. When this condition fails, no quantitative inferences about heritability can be drawn from measured phenotypic variances and covariances, except under special conditions that are unlikely to be satisfied by phenotypically plastic traits in human populations. Inadequate understanding of the precise environmental factors relevant to the development of specific behavioral traits is an important source of systematic errors, as is the inability to allow adequately for the effects of assortative mating and gene-gene interaction. Systematic cultural differences and differences in psychological environment among races and among sociocco-nomic groups vitiate any attempt to draw from IQ data meaningful inferences about genetic differences. Estimates based on phenotypic correlations between separated monozygotic twins-usually considered to be the most reliable kind of estimates-are vitiated by systematic errors inherent in IQ tests, by the presence of genotype-environment correlation, and by the lack of detailed understanding of environmental factors relevant to the development of behavioral traits. Other kinds of estimates are beset, in addition, by systematic errors arising from incomplete allowance for the effects of assortative mating and from gene-gene interactions. The only potentially useful data are phenotypic correlations between unrelated foster children reared together, which could, in principle, yield lower limits for e(2). Available data indicate that, for unrelated foster children reared together, the broad heritability (h(2)) may lie between 0.0 and 0.5. This estimate does not apply to populations composed of children reared by their biological parents or by near relatives. For such populations the heritability of IQ remains undefined. The only data that might yield meaningful estimates ot narrow heritability are phenotypic correlations between half-sibs reared in statistically independent environments. No useful data of this kind are available. Intervention studies like Heber's Milwaukee Project afford an alternative and comparatively direct way of studying the plasticity of cognitive and other behavioral traits in human populations. Results obtained so far strongly suggest that the development of cognitive skills is highly sensitive to variations in environmental factors. These conclusions have three obvious implications for the broader issues mentioned at the beginning of this article. 1) Published analyses of IQ data provide no support whatever for Jensen's thesis that inequalities in cognitive performance are due largely to genetic differences. As Lewontin (8) has clearly shown, the value of the broad heritability of IQ is in any case only marginally relevant to this question. I have argued that conventional estimates of the broad heritability of IQ are invalid and that the only data on which potentially valid estimates might be based are consistent with a broad heritability of less than 0.5. On the other hand, intervention studies, if their findings prove to be replicable, would directly establish that, under suitable conditions, the offspring of parents whose cognitive skills are so poorly developed as to exclude them from all but the most menial occupations can achieve what are regarded as distinctly high levels of cognitive performance. Thus, despite the fact that children differ suibstantially in cognitive aptitudes and appetites, and despite the very high probability that these differences have a substantial genetic component, available scientific evidence strongly suggests that environmental factors are responsible for the failure of children not suffering from specific neurological disorders to achieve adequate levels of cognitive performance. 2) Under prevailing social conditions, no valid inferences can be drawn from IQ data concerning systematic genetic differences among races or socioeconomic groups. Research along present lines directed toward this end-whatever its ethical status-is scientifically worthless. 3) Since there are no suitable data for estimating the narrow heritability of IQ, it seems pointless to speculate about the prospects for a hereditary meritocracy based on IQ.
Little is known about the factors which regulate the growth and development of the mammalian brain. Although proliferation of neuronal cells ceases relatively early in development, certain types of glial cells proliferate and differentiate mainly perinatally. In the perinatal period, the ability of acetylcholine to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in brain reaches peak levels, and indeed the stable acetylcholine analogue carbachol can stimulate PI hydrolysis of primary neonatal astroglial cells. As PI hydrolysis is thought to be important in the regulation of cell proliferation, we investigated whether cellular DNA synthesis can be induced by carbachol. Our results show that carbachol stimulates DNA synthesis via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), in primary astrocytes derived from perinatal rat brain, in an age-dependent fashion. Carbachol is also mitogenic in certain brain-derived astrocytoma and neuroblastoma cell lines, as well as in chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing recombinant muscarinic receptors. DNA synthesis is strongly activated by carbachol in those brain-derived cell lines and transfected CHO cells that express mAChR subtypes which activate PI hydrolysis efficiently, and poorly activated in cells expressing mAChR subtypes which only weakly activate PI hydrolysis. These results strongly support a role for acetylcholine in regulating astroglial cell growth in the developing brain, and indicate that the specificity of acetylcholine-induced cell proliferation may be determined by the expression of those mAChR subtypes which activate PI hydrolysis.
Antipsychotic or neuroleptic drugs, which block central dopamine receptors, produce a behavioural state in animals in which they fail to correct externally imposed postures. This is referred to as catalepsy. Previous lesion studies have shown that the dopamine receptors in the striatum are involved in this neuroleptic-induced catalepsy. Dopamine receptors, identified by the specific, high-affinity binding of the potent neuroleptic haloperiodol, have been shown to be equally distributed postsynaptically on striatal neurones and presynaptically on cortico-striatal terminals. Because the electrolytic lesioning studies have unavoidably damaged both pre- and postsynaptic striatal dopamine receptors, it is not known whether these two receptors are separately involved in neuroleptic-induced catalepsy. Using kainic acid and cortical ablation to destroy postsynaptic and presynaptic dopamine receptors, respectively, the present study demonstrates that the cataleptic effects of haloperidol are apparently mediated by dopamine receptors localised postsynaptically on striatal neurones.
The neurons of layer 4 in the adult cerebral cortex receive their major ascending inputs from the thalamus. In development, however, thalamic axons arrive at the appropriate cortical area long before their target layer 4 neurons have migrated into the cortical plate. The axons accumulate and wait in the zone below the cortical plate, the subplate, for several weeks before invading the cortical plate. The subplate is a transient zone that contains the first postmitotic neurons of the telencephalon. These neurons mature well before other cortical neurons, and disappear by cell death after the thalamic axons have grown into the overlying cortical plate. The close proximity of growing thalamocortical axons and subplate neurons suggests that they might be involved in interactions important for normal thalamocortical development. Here we show that early in development the deletion of subplate neurons located beneath visual cortex prevents axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus from recognizing and innervating visual cortex, their normal target. In the absence of subplate neurons, lateral geniculate nucleus axons continue to grow in the white matter past visual cortex despite the presence of their target layer 4 neurons. Thus the transient subplate neurons are necessary for appropriate cortical target selection by thalamocortical axons.
A large proportion of right-hemisphere stroke patients show hemispatial neglect-a neurological deficit of perception, attention, representation, and/or performing actions within their left-sided space, inducing many functional debilitating effects on everyday life, and responsible for poor functional recovery and ability to benefit from treatment. The frequent parietal locus of the lesion producing neglect reflects the impairment of coordinate transformation used by the nervous system to represent extrapersonal space. Given that adaptation to a visual distortion can provide an efficient way to stimulate neural structures responsible for the transformation of sensorimotor coordinates, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of prism adaptation on various neglect symptoms, including the pathological shift of the subjective midline to the right. All patients exposed to the optical shift of the visual field to the right were improved on their manual body-midline demonstration and on classical neuropsychological tests. Unlike other physiological manipulations used to improve neglect, this improvement lasted for at least two hours after prism removal and thus could be useful in rehabilitation programmes. The positive effect found for both sensorimotor and more cognitive spatial functions suggests that they share or depend on a common level of space representation linked to multisensory integration.
The direction and rate at which an object moves are normally not correlated with the manifold physical cues (for example, brightness and texture) that enable it to be seen. As befits its goals, human perception of visual motion largely evades this diversity of cues for image form; direction and rate of motion are perceived (with few exceptions) in a fashion that does not depend on the physical characteristics of the object. The middle temporal visual area of the primate cerebral cortex contains many neurons that respond selectively to motion in a particular direction and is an integral part of the neural substrate for perception of motion. When stimulated with moving patterns characterized by one of three very diverse cues for form, many middle temporal neurons exhibited similar directional tuning. This lack of sensitivity for figural cue characteristics may allow the uniform perception of motion of objects having a broad spectrum of physical cues.
Removal of sensory input from a focal region of adult neocortex can lead to a large reorganization of cortical topography within the deprived area during subsequent months. Although this form of functional recovery is now well documented across several sensory systems, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive. Weeks after binocular retinal lesions silence a corresponding portion of striate cortex in the adult cat, this cortex again becomes responsive, this time to retinal loci immediately outside the scotoma. Earlier findings showed a lack of reorganization in the lateral geniculate nucleus and an inadequate spread of geniculocortical afferents to account for the cortical reorganization, suggesting the involvement of intrinsic cortical connections. We investigated the possibility that intracortical axonal sprouting mediates long-term reorganization of cortical functional architecture. The anterograde label biocytin was used to compare the density of lateral projections into reorganized and non-deprived cortex. We report here that structural changes in the form of axonal sprouting of long-range laterally projecting neurons accompany topographic remodelling of the visual cortex.
The auditory cortex of the mustache bat, Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus, is composed of functional divisions which are differently organized to be suited for processing the elements of its biosonar signal according to their biological significance. Unlike the Doppler-shifted-CF (constant frequency) processing area, the area processing the frequency-modulated components does not show clear tonotopic and amplitopic representations, but consists of several clusters of neurons, each of which is sensitive to a particular combination (or combinations) of information-bearing elements of the biosonar signal and echoes. The response properties of neurons in the major clusters indicate that processing of information carried by the frequency-modulated components of echoes is facilitated by the first harmonic of the emitted biosonar signal. The properties of some of these neurons suggest that they are tuned to a target which has a particular cross-sectional area and which is located at a particular distance.
In the rat, doses of glucose sufficient to raise glucose concentrations in the blood to levels equivalent to those produced by a meal or stress suppress the firing of dopamine-containing neurons located within the substantia nigra. Glucose also prevents or reverses the increase in discharge rates of dopaminergic cells normally elicited by the antipsychotic agent haloperidol.
Focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) is a member of a growing family of structurally distinct protein tyrosine kinases that includes the recently identified FakB and PYK2/CAKbeta/RAFTK. Activation of pp125FAK has been functionally linked to the formation of focal adhesions, integrin-mediated sites of contact between the cell and the extracellular matrix. The carboxy-terminal domain of pp125FAK is also expressed as a separate protein called pp41/43FRNK (where FRNK represents pp125FAK-related non-kinase). Here we show that pp41/43FRNK acts as an inhibitor of pp125FAK by transiently blocking the formation of focal adhesions on fibronectin and constitutively reducing tyrosine phosphorylation of both pp125FAK and two focal adhesion proteins, tensin and paxillin. These inhibitory effects of pp41/43FRNK are reversed by co-expression of pp125FAK, suggesting that pp125FAK and pp41/43 FRNK compete for a common binding protein(s) whose association with pp125FAK is necessary for signalling by pp125FAK. We propose that pp41/43FRNK functions as an endogenous regulator of pp125FAK, thus providing an unusual means to regulate both tyrosine kinase activity and cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix.
The present study was undertaken to examine the possibility that cerebral energy metabolism can be fueled by lactate. As a sole energy substrate, lactate supported normal synaptic function in rat hippocampal slices for hours without any sign of deterioration. Slices that were synaptically silent as a result of glucose depletion could be reactivated with lactate to show normal synaptic function. When slices were exposed to the glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetic acid, lactate-supported synaptic function was unaffected, whereas that supported by glucose was completely abolished. This indicated that lactate was metabolized directly via pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, under conditions that lead to lactate accumulation (cerebral ischemia) this "end product" may be a useful alternative as a substrate for energy metabolism.
Protein folding and unfolding are coupled to a range of biological phenomena, from the regulation of cellular activity to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Defining the nature of the conformations sampled in nonnative proteins is crucial for understanding the origins of such phenomena. We have used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis to study unfolded states of the protein lysozyme. Extensive clusters of hydrophobic structure exist within the wild-type protein even under strongly denaturing conditions. These clusters involve distinct regions of the sequence but are all disrupted by a single point mutation that replaced residue Trp62 with Gly located at the interface of the two major structural domains in the native state. Thus, nativelike structure in the denatured protein is stabilized by the involvement of Trp62 in nonnative and long-range interactions.
In chicks, visual deprivation leads to myopia and enlargement of the vitreous chamber of the eye. When chicks were raised with white translucent occluders over their eyes so that either the nasal half, the temporal half, or all of the retina was visually deprived, the resulting myopia (median = -15 diopters) was limited to the deprived part of the retina, regardless of which half of the retina was visually deprived; the nondeprived part remained nearly emmetropic. Correspondingly, the vitreous chamber was elongated only in the region of the visual deprivation, resulting in eyes with different asymmetric shapes depending on which retinal region was deprived. These results argue for a local regulation of ocular growth that is dependent on vision and suggest a hypothesis to explain the epidemiological association of myopia in humans with large amounts of reading. Because most nonfoveal retinal neurons have large receptive fields, they cannot resolve the individual letters on the printed page; this may lead to their activity being less during reading than during most other forms of visual stimulation. Thus, the impoverished stimulus situation of reading may lead to myopia, as do other types of visual form deprivation.
The receptive fields of certain ganglion cells in the goldfish retina have been mapped. These fields are "off" center. "on-off" intermediate, and "on" periphery types. The excitatory process controlling the "on" response is stimulated maximally by green light; the "off" response process, inhibitory in nature, is stimulated maximally by red light. The two processes can be light adapted independently.
Mutations in the unc-17 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans produce deficits in neuromuscular function. This gene was cloned and complementary DNAs were sequenced. On the basis of sequence similarity to mammalian vesicular transporters of biogenic amines and of localization to synaptic vesicles of cholinergic neurons in C. elegans, unc-17 likely encodes the vesicular transporter of acetylcholine. Mutations that eliminated all unc-17 gene function were lethal, suggesting that the acetylcholine transporter is essential. Molecular analysis of unc-17 mutations will allow the correlation of specific parts of the gene (and the protein) with observed functional defects. The mutants will also be useful for the isolation of extragenic suppressors, which could identify genes encoding proteins that interact with UNC-17.
Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a leading cause of death due to disease in young people, but the biological determinants of treatment failure remain poorly understood. Recent genome-wide profiling of structural DNA alterations in ALL have identified multiple submicroscopic somatic mutations targeting key cellular pathways, and have demonstrated substantial evolution in genetic alterations from diagnosis to relapse. However, DNA sequence mutations in ALL have not been analysed in detail. To identify novel mutations in relapsed ALL, we resequenced 300 genes in matched diagnosis and relapse samples from 23 patients with ALL. This identified 52 somatic non-synonymous mutations in 32 genes, many of which were novel, including the transcriptional coactivators CREBBP and NCOR1, the transcription factors ERG, SPI1, TCF4 and TCF7L2, components of the Ras signalling pathway, histone genes, genes involved in histone modification (CREBBP and CTCF), and genes previously shown to be targets of recurring DNA copy number alteration in ALL. Analysis of an extended cohort of 71 diagnosis-relapse cases and 270 acute leukaemia cases that did not relapse found that 18.3% of relapse cases had sequence or deletion mutations of CREBBP, which encodes the transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CREBBP, also known as CBP). The mutations were either present at diagnosis or acquired at relapse, and resulted in truncated alleles or deleterious substitutions in conserved residues of the histone acetyltransferase domain. Functionally, the mutations impaired histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation of CREBBP targets, including glucocorticoid responsive genes. Several mutations acquired at relapse were detected in subclones at diagnosis, suggesting that the mutations may confer resistance to therapy. These results extend the landscape of genetic alterations in leukaemia, and identify mutations targeting transcriptional and epigenetic regulation as a mechanism of resistance in ALL.
Why dopamine-containing neurons of the brain's substantia nigra pars compacta die in Parkinson's disease has been an enduring mystery. Our studies suggest that the unusual reliance of these neurons on L-type Ca(v)1.3 Ca2+ channels to drive their maintained, rhythmic pacemaking renders them vulnerable to stressors thought to contribute to disease progression. The reliance on these channels increases with age, as juvenile dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta use pacemaking mechanisms common to neurons not affected in Parkinson's disease. These mechanisms remain latent in adulthood, and blocking Ca(v)1.3 Ca2+ channels in adult neurons induces a reversion to the juvenile form of pacemaking. Such blocking ('rejuvenation') protects these neurons in both in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease, pointing to a new strategy that could slow or stop the progression of the disease.
An extra eye primordium was implanted into the forebrain region of embryonic Rana pipiens. During development both normal and supernumerary optic tracts terminated within a single, previously uninnervated tectal lobe. Autoradiographic tracing of either the normal or supernumerary eye's projection revealed distinct, eye-specific bands of radioactivity running rostrocaudally through the dually innervated tectum. Interactions among axons of retinal ganglion cells, possibly mediated through tectal neurons, must be invoked to explain this stereotyped disruption of the normally continuous retinal termination pattern.
The phosphoric amide herbicide amiprophos-methyl (APM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of taxol-induced rose microtubule polymerization in vitro. Parallel studies on taxol-induced assembly of bovine brain microtubules showed no effect of APM at a concentration ten times that required to give complete inhibition of rose microtubule assembly. The data indicate that (i) APM is a specific and potent antimicrotubule drug and (ii) APM directly poisons microtubule dynamics in plant cells, rather than indirectly depolymerizing microtubules through a previously proposed mechanism involving deregulation of intracellular calcium levels.
Horizontal gene transfer plays a major role in microbial evolution. However, newly acquired sequences can decrease fitness unless integrated into preexisting regulatory networks. We found that the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) selectively silences horizontally acquired genes by targeting sequences with GC content lower than the resident genome. Mutations in hns are lethal in Salmonella unless accompanied by compensatory mutations in other regulatory loci. Thus, H-NS provides a previously unrecognized mechanism of bacterial defense against foreign DNA, enabling the acquisition of DNA from exogenous sources while avoiding detrimental consequences from unregulated expression of newly acquired genes. Characteristic GC/AT ratios of bacterial genomes may facilitate discrimination between a cell's own DNA and foreign DNA.
6-Sulfidopeptide-containing leukotriene-like immunoreactivity was synthesized in gerbil forebrains after bilateral common carotid occlusion and reperfusion. At 5, 10, or 15 minutes of ischemia, concentrations increased significantly and became more marked on reperfusion. Immunoreactivity was highest in forebrain gray matter and was below the detection limit of the assay in brain regions remote from the zone of ischemia. In vitro experiments with vascular cells and organ cultures of cerebral arteries indicate that the cerebral blood vessel wall is not a major source of biosynthetic activity in the brain. These experiments demonstrate leukotriene biosynthesis by the brain. Because synthesis occurs during ischemia and reperfusion and because leukotrienes are potent vasoconstrictors and promoters of tissue edema, they may play a role in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia.
The SWI1, SWI2, and SWI3 proteins, which are required for regulated transcription of numerous yeast genes, were found also to be essential for rat glucocorticoid receptor function in yeast; the receptor failed to activate transcription in strains with mutations in the SWI1, SWI2, or SWI3 genes. Certain mutations in genes encoding components of chromatin, identified as suppressors of swi mutations, partially relieved the SWI- requirement for receptor function. Immunoprecipitation of glucocorticoid receptor derivatives from wild-type (SWI+) yeast extracts coprecipitated the SWI3 protein; such receptor-SWI3 complexes were not detected in swi1- or swi2- mutant strains, implying that a complex of multiple SWI proteins may associate with the receptor. Prior incubation of a Drosophila embryo transcription extract with the yeast SWI3-specific antibody inhibited receptor function in vitro whereas the antibody had no effect if added after initiation complex formation. Thus, positive regulation by the glucocorticoid receptor in vivo and in vitro appears to require its interaction, at an early step, with one or more SWI proteins.
Monoclonal antibodies specific for monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and MAO B, respectively, were used to localize these enzymes in primate brain. The reagents recognized different populations of neurons: those that recognized MAO A were located in cell groups containing catecholamines, including the substantia nigra, nucleus locus coeruleus, nucleus subcoeruleus, and the periventricular region of the hypothalamus, whereas those that recognized MAO B were observed in serotonin regions, including the nucleus raphe dorsalis and nucleus centralis superior. These data illustrate the physiological independence of MAO A and B and show that neurons may be specialized for their degradative as well as their synthetic functions.
The structures of five neurotrophic molecules have so far been published. Nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and purpurin, have been identified as nerve-cell survival molecules. More recently, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor have been cloned and sequenced. As all these proteins stimulate the survival of ciliary or sensory neurons, a new cell survival assay is required if novel neurotrophic molecules are to be discovered. P19 teratoma cells differentiate to nerve-like cells in the presence of 5 x 10(-7) M retinoic acid (RA). But when P19 cells are plated in N2 synthetic medium without being exposed to RA, they die within 48 h. In an attempt to identify a molecule(s) that can substitute for RA in promoting P19 survival, we assayed serum-free growth-conditioned media for their ability to promote P19 survival. One cell line from the rat eye secreted a molecule that promoted the survival of P19 cells and some types of nerve cell. We identified this molecule as activin, better known for its role in hormone secretion.
Chemically induced differentiation of cultured murine erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells results in a several hundred-fold increase in transcription of the adult mouse globin genes and thus serves as a model for gene activation during erythropoiesis. One approach to study gene regulation in this system has been to analyse the expression of foreign globin genes introduced into MEL cells. By introducing cosmid DNA containing the human adult(beta), fetal(gamma) and embryonic(epsilon)-globin genes, we have shown here that expression of the beta, but not the gamma or epsilon genes, is regulated during MEL differentiation. Regulated expression of the human beta-globin gene was observed when it was introduced either as part of the intact globin gene cluster or as an individual gene with 1.5 kilobases (kb) of 5' flanking DNA. Transcription from a herpes simplex virus (HSV) promoter adjacent to the thymidine kinase (tk) gene is also inducible in MEL cells.
Neurons in the primary visual cortex are selective for the size, orientation and direction of motion of patterns falling within a restricted region of visual space known as the receptive field. The response to stimuli presented within the receptive field can be facilitated or suppressed by other stimuli falling outside the receptive field which, when presented in isolation, fail to activate the cell. Whether this interaction is facilitative or suppressive depends on the relative orientation of pattern elements inside and outside the receptive field. Here we show that neuronal facilitation preferentially occurs when a near-threshold stimulus inside the receptive field is flanked by higher-contrast, collinear elements located in surrounding regions of visual space. Collinear flanks and orthogonally oriented flanks, however, both act to reduce the response to high-contrast stimuli presented within the receptive field. The observed pattern of facilitation and suppression may be the cellular basis for the observation in humans that the detectability of an oriented pattern is enhanced by collinear flanking elements. Modulation of neuronal responses by stimuli falling outside their receptive fields may thus represent an early neural mechanism for encoding objects and enhancing their perceptual saliency.
Intracisternal injection of ovine corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) into the pylorus-ligated rat or the rat with gastric fistula resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of gastric secretion stimulated with pentagastrin or thyrotropin-releasing hormone. When injected into the lateral hypothalamus--but not when injected into the cerebral cortex--CRF suppressed pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion. The inhibitory effect of CRF was blocked by vagotomy and adrenalectomy but not by hypophysectomy or naloxone treatment. These results indicate that CRF acts within the brain to inhibit gastric acid secretion through vagal and adrenal mechanisms and not through hypophysiotropic effects.
The fate of ventral epidermal cells differs among nematode species. Nonvulval cells fuse with the epidermis in Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas the homologous cells undergo apoptosis in Pristionchus pacificus. The homeotic gene lin-39 is involved in the regulation of these epidermal cell fates. In Caenorhabditis, lin-39 prevents cell fusion of potential vulval cells and specifies the vulva equivalence group. Pristionchus vulvaless mutants that displayed apoptosis of the vulval precursor cells were isolated, and point mutations in lin-39 were identified. Thus, the evolution of these epidermal cell fates is driven by different intrinsic properties of homologous cells.
Arthropod head segments offer a paradigm for understanding the diversification of form during evolution, as a variety of morphologically diverse appendages have arisen from them. There has been long-running controversy, however, concerning which head appendages are homologous among arthropods, and from which ancestral arrangement they have been derived. This controversy has recently been rekindled by the proposition that the probable ancestral arrangement, with appendages on the first head segment, has not been lost in all extant arthropods as previously thought, but has been retained in the pycnogonids, or sea spiders. This proposal was based on the neuroanatomical analysis of larvae from the sea spider Anoplodactylus sp., and suggested that the most anterior pair of appendages, the chelifores, are innervated from the first part of the brain, the protocerebrum. Our examination of Hox gene expression in another sea spider, Endeis spinosa, refutes this hypothesis. The anterior boundaries of Hox gene expression domains place the chelifore appendages as clearly belonging to the second head segment, innervated from the second part of the brain, the deutocerebrum. The deutocerebrum must have been secondarily displaced towards the protocerebrum in pycnogonid ancestors. As anterior-most appendages are also deutocerebral in the other two arthropod groups, the Euchelicerata and the Mandibulata, we conclude that the protocerebral appendages have been lost in all extant arthropods.
Altering the balance of activity between the two eyes during the critical period for visual-system development profoundly affects competitive interactions among neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex. Neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus that are deprived of activity by closing or silencing one eye atrophy as a result of competition with non-deprived neurons for some critical factor(s) presumed to be present in the cortex. Based on their actions in the developing visual system, neurotrophins are attractive candidates for such factors. We tested whether neurotrophins mediate intracortical competition of afferents from the lateral geniculate nucleus by using monocular deprivation and a new method for highly localized, in vivo delivery of neurotrophins. This method allowed unambiguous identification of neurons that were exposed to neurotrophin. Here we report that only one neurotrophin, the TrkB ligand NT-4, rescued neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus from the dystrophic effects of monocular deprivation.
Central nervous system myelin is a specialized structure produced by oligodendrocytes that ensheaths axons, allowing rapid and efficient saltatory conduction of action potentials. Many disorders promote damage to and eventual loss of the myelin sheath, which often results in significant neurological morbidity. However, little is known about the fundamental mechanisms that initiate myelin damage, with the assumption being that its fate follows that of the parent oligodendrocyte. Here we show that NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) glutamate receptors mediate Ca2+ accumulation in central myelin in response to chemical ischaemia in vitro. Using two-photon microscopy, we imaged fluorescence of the Ca2+ indicator X-rhod-1 loaded into oligodendrocytes and the cytoplasmic compartment of the myelin sheath in adult rat optic nerves. The AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX completely blocked the ischaemic Ca2+ increase in oligodendroglial cell bodies, but only modestly reduced the Ca2+ increase in myelin. In contrast, the Ca2+ increase in myelin was abolished by broad-spectrum NMDA receptor antagonists (MK-801, 7-chlorokynurenic acid, d-AP5), but not by more selective blockers of NR2A and NR2B subunit-containing receptors (NVP-AAM077 and ifenprodil). In vitro ischaemia causes ultrastructural damage to both axon cylinders and myelin. NMDA receptor antagonism greatly reduced the damage to myelin. NR1, NR2 and NR3 subunits were detected in myelin by immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation, indicating that all necessary subunits are present for the formation of functional NMDA receptors. Our data show that the mature myelin sheath can respond independently to injurious stimuli. Given that axons are known to release glutamate, our finding that the Ca2+ increase was mediated in large part by activation of myelinic NMDA receptors suggests a new mechanism of axo-myelinic signalling. Such a mechanism may represent a potentially important therapeutic target in disorders in which demyelination is a prominent feature, such as multiple sclerosis, neurotrauma, infections (for example, HIV encephalomyelopathy) and aspects of ischaemic brain injury.
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate most of our physiological responses to hormones, neurotransmitters and environmental stimulants, and so have great potential as therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of diseases. They are also fascinating molecules from the perspective of membrane-protein structure and biology. Great progress has been made over the past three decades in understanding diverse GPCRs, from pharmacology to functional characterization in vivo. Recent high-resolution structural studies have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of GPCR activation and constitutive activity.
Optical methods were used to locate the cell bodies of directionally selective ganglion cells in isolated rabbit retinas. These neurons detect the direction in which images move across the retinal surface and transmit that information to the brain. The receptive field of each identified cell was determined, after which the cell was injected with Lucifer yellow. An image of the receptive field border was then projected onto the fluorescent image of the dendrites, allowing precise comparison between them. The size of the receptive field matched closely the size of the dendritic arbor of that cell. This result restricts the types of convergence that can be postulated in modeling the mechanism of retinal directional selectivity.
Chromosomal translocations associated with malignancies often result in deregulated expression of genes encoding transcription factors. In human T-cell leukaemias such regulators belong to diverse protein families and may normally be expressed widely (for example, Ttg-1/rbtn1, Ttg-2/rbtn2), exclusively outside the haematopoietic system (for example, Hox11), or specifically in haematopoietic cells and other selected sites (for example, tal-1/SCL, lyl-1). Aberrant expression within T cells is though to interfere with programmes of normal maturation. The most frequently activated gene in acute T-cell leukaemias, tal-1 (also called SCL), encodes a candidate regulator of haematopoietic development, a basic-helix-loop-helix protein, related to critical myogenic and neurogenic factors. Here we show by targeted gene disruption in mice that tal-1 is essential for embryonic blood formation in vivo. With respect to embryonic erythropoiesis, tal-1 deficiency resembles loss of the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 or the LIM protein rbtn2. Profound reduction in myeloid cells cultured in vivo from tal-1 null yolk sacs suggests a broader defect manifest at the myelo-erythroid or multipotential progenitor cell level.
Synaptic plasticity is a key mechanism for chronic pain. It occurs at different levels of the central nervous system, including spinal cord and cortex. Studies have mainly focused on signaling proteins that trigger these plastic changes, whereas few have addressed the maintenance of plastic changes related to chronic pain. We found that protein kinase M zeta (PKMz) maintains pain-induced persistent changes in the mouse anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Peripheral nerve injury caused activation of PKMz in the ACC, and inhibiting PKMz by a selective inhibitor, z-pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide (ZIP), erased synaptic potentiation. Microinjection of ZIP into the ACC blocked behavioral sensitization. These results suggest that PKMz in the ACC acts to maintain neuropathic pain. PKMz could thus be a new therapeutic target for treating chronic pain.
The population vector hypothesis was introduced almost twenty years ago to illustrate that a population vector constructed from neural activity in primary motor cortex (MI) of non-human primates could predict the direction of hand movement during reaching. Alternative explanations for this population signal have been suggested but could not be tested experimentally owing to movement complexity in the standard reaching model. We re-examined this issue by recording the activity of neurons in contralateral MI of monkeys while they made reaching movements with their right arms oriented in the horizontal plane-where the mechanics of limb motion are measurable and anisotropic. Here we found systematic biases between the population vector and the direction of hand movement. These errors were attributed to a non-uniform distribution of preferred directions of neurons and the non-uniformity covaried with peak joint power at the shoulder and elbow. These observations contradict the population vector hypothesis and show that non-human primates are capable of generating reaching movements to spatial targets even though population vectors based on MI activity do not point in the direction of hand motion.
Excitatory amino acids such as L-glutamate and L-aspartate are well established as neurotransmitter candidates in the mammalian central nervous system, and three types of receptor for these substances have been proposed, characterized by the agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate and quisqualate. All these receptors have been suggested to have synaptic roles in excitatory transmission in the brain. Here I demonstrate that NMDA receptors play a crucial role in the observed response of ventrobasal thalamus (VB) neurones to natural stimulation of somatosensory afferents, but do not appear to be responsible for the short-latency excitation seen on electrical stimulation of the afferents which is apparently mediated by excitatory amino-acid receptors of the non-NMDA type. This result indicates an involvement of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors in the responses of VB neurones to stimulation of somatosensory somatosensory afferents, depending on the mode of stimulation of the pathway.
L cells, a family of continuous cell lines of mouse fibroblastic origin, generate a prolonged active membrane hyperpolarization (the hyperpolarizing activation response) when stimulated mechanically or electrically. lontophoretically applied acetylcholine elicits a similar response; atropine blocks the acetylcholine but not the electrically or mechanically elicited responses. The hyperpolarizing activation response can also be elicited by electrical, mechanical, or acetylcholine stimulation of cells adjacent to the recorded cell. Propagation of the response from one cell to another is not dependent on direct electrical coupling between cells and is not blocked by application of a bath containing atropine or curare. These results show that L cells are capable of generating an active electrical response. that they are sensitive to at least one neurotransmitter (acetylcholine), and that humorally mediated interaction (probably noncholinergic) between L cells occurs.
The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilizes retinal images by generating smooth eye movements that are equal in amplitude and opposite in direction to head turns. Whenever image motion occurs persistently during head turns, the VOR undergoes motor learning; as a result image stability is gradually restored. A group of brain stem neurons that are in the modified pathways has now been described. The neurons express changes in firing in association with motor learning in the VOR and receive monosynaptic inhibition from the flocculus of the cerebellum. The changes in firing have an appropriate magnitude and are expressed at the correct latency to account for the altered VOR. The response properties of the neurons point to their brain stem vestibular inputs for further investigation of the site of motor learning.
During neurotransmitter release at the synapse, influx of calcium ions stimulates the release of neurotransmitter. However, the mechanism by which synaptic vesicle fusion is coupled to calcium has been unclear, despite the identification of both the core fusion machinery [soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)] and the principal calcium sensor (synaptotagmin). Here, we describe what may represent a basic principle of the coupling mechanism: a reversible clamping protein (complexin) that can freeze the SNAREpin, an assembled fusion-competent intermediate en route to fusion. When calcium binds to the calcium sensor synaptotagmin, the clamp would then be released. SNARE proteins, and key regulators like synaptotagmin and complexin, can be ectopically expressed on the cell surface. Cells expressing such "flipped" synaptic SNAREs fuse constitutively, but when we coexpressed complexin, fusion was blocked. Adding back calcium triggered fusion from this intermediate in the presence of synaptotagmin.
Vasopressin and related peptides (10(-9) to 10(-6) molar) induced bursting pacemaker potential activity and altered the current-voltage relations of the membrane in a specific molluscan neurosecretory cell. These effects long outlasted the period of application of the peptides. Sensitivity of the cell to these peptides was primarily localized on the axon hillock region. The observed effects do not resemble conductance changes evoked by conventional neurotransmitters, but rather suggest a membrane regulatory role for these peptides, and thus may be indicative of a new form of information transfer in the nervous system.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of gene regulatory molecules (reviewed in refs 1, 2). Although computational work indicates that miRNAs repress more than a third of human genes, their roles in vertebrate development are only now beginning to be determined. Here we show that miR-196 acts upstream of Hoxb8 and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in vivo in the context of limb development, thereby identifying a previously observed but uncharacterized inhibitory activity that operates specifically in the hindlimb. Our data indicate that miR-196 functions in a fail-safe mechanism to assure the fidelity of expression domains that are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level, supporting the idea that many vertebrate miRNAs may function as a secondary level of gene regulation.
The cause of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) is unknown. Patients with HD have an expanded NH2-terminal polyglutamine region in huntingtin. An NH2-terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin was localized to neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) and dystrophic neurites (DNs) in the HD cortex and striatum, which are affected in HD, and polyglutamine length influenced the extent of huntingtin accumulation in these structures. Ubiquitin was also found in NIIs and DNs, which suggests that abnormal huntingtin is targeted for proteolysis but is resistant to removal. The aggregation of mutant huntingtin may be part of the pathogenic mechanism in HD.
The reality of axoplasmic transport is widely accepted; various neutrotransmitters, enzymes, labelled proteins and peptides are known to move rapidly along the axons of different nerve fibres. In the terminals of sympathetic nerves, noradrenaline release is controlled by various regulatory mechanisms which imply the occurrence of presynaptic receptors. In this regard, there is considerable indirect physiological evidence for the existence of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the sympathetic nerve endings; the stimulation by acetylcholine of such presynaptic receptors elicits an inhibitory effect on noradrenaline release. We not provide direct biochemical evidence for the occurrence in dog splenic nerve of muscarinic receptors which seem to move along the axon as suggested by their rapid accumulation on either side of a ligature.
Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by the accumulation of a pathogenic protein, Huntingtin (Htt), that contains an abnormal polyglutamine expansion. Here, we report that a pathogenic fragment of Htt (Httex1p) can be modified either by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1 or by ubiquitin on identical lysine residues. In cultured cells, SUMOylation stabilizes Httex1p, reduces its ability to form aggregates, and promotes its capacity to repress transcription. In a Drosophila model of HD, SUMOylation of Httex1p exacerbates neurodegeneration, whereas ubiquitination of Httex1p abrogates neurodegeneration. Lysine mutations that prevent both SUMOylation and ubiquitination of Httex1p reduce HD pathology, indicating that the contribution of SUMOylation to HD pathology extends beyond preventing Htt ubiquitination and degradation.
The Drosophila central nervous system develops from a segmentally reiterated array of 30 unique neural precursors, called neuroblasts. Each neuroblast goes through a stereotyped cell lineage to produce an invariant clone of neural progeny. It is critical to identify the genes that specify neuroblast identity as these genes control the time of formation, gene expression profile, and cell lineage characteristics of each neuroblast. Here we show that the Pax-type gooseberry-distal gene specifies row 5 neuroblast identity. Initially, four rows of neuroblasts form per segment (1, 3, 5, 7) and gooseberry-distal is expressed in row 5 neuroblasts. By using 10 molecular markers, and by following the number and orientation of neuroblast divisions, we show that lack of gooseberry-distal transforms row 5 neuroblasts into row 3 neuroblasts, whereas ubiquitous gooseberry-distal generates the reciprocal transformation. Thus, gooseberry-distal is necessary and sufficient to specify row 5 neuroblast identity autonomously. The 10 genes coordinately regulated by gooseberry-distal are prime candidates for controlling specific aspects of neuroblast identity.
gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain, is believed to act by increasing membrane conductance of chloride ions. In this study it was found that GABA agonists increased the uptake of chloride-36 by cell-free membrane preparations from mouse brain. This influx was rapid (less than 5 seconds), and 13 micromolar GABA produced a half-maximal effect. The GABA antagonists (bicuculline and picrotoxin) blocked the effect of GABA, whereas pentobarbital enhanced the action. This may be the first demonstration of functional coupling among GABA and barbiturate receptors and chloride channels in isolated membranes. The technique should facilitate biochemical and pharmacological studies of GABA receptor-effector coupling.
Drug-dependent neural plasticity related to drug addiction and schizophrenia can be modeled in animals as behavioral sensitization, which is induced by repeated noncontingent or self-administration of many drugs of abuse. Molecular mechanisms that are critical for behavioral sensitization have yet to be specified. Long-term depression (LTD) of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission in the brain has been proposed as a cellular substrate for learning and memory. The expression of LTD in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) required clathrin-dependent endocytosis of postsynaptic AMPARs. NAc LTD was blocked by a dynamin-derived peptide that inhibited clathrin-mediated endocytosis or by a GluR2-derived peptide that blocked regulated AMPAR endocytosis. Systemic or intra-NAc infusion of the membrane-permeable GluR2 peptide prevented the expression of amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization in the rat.
A 9-month-old dog with a history of progressive motor dysfunction was shown to have a deficiency in brain beta-galactosidase activity. The canine disease, like that of children with GM1 gangliosidosis, is characterized by accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in the brain, liver, and spleen, and membranous cytoplasmic bodies in neurons. The dog's pedigree suggests an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.
The Drosophila protein Shaggy (Sgg, also known as Zeste-white3, Zw3) and its vertebrate orthologue glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) are inhibitory components of the Wingless (Wg) and Wnt pathways. Here we show that Sgg is also a negative regulator in the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. In Drosophila, Hh acts both by blocking the proteolytic processing of full-length Cubitus interruptus, Ci (Ci155), to generate a truncated repressor form (Ci75), and by stimulating the activity of accumulated Ci155 (refs 2-6). Loss of sgg gene function results in a cell-autonomous accumulation of high levels of Ci155 and the ectopic expression of Hh-responsive genes including decapentaplegic (dpp) and wg. Simultaneous removal of sgg and Suppressor of fused, Su(fu), results in wing duplications similar to those caused by ectopic Hh signalling. Ci is phosphorylated by GSK3 after a primed phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), and mutating GSK3-phosphorylation sites in Ci blocks its processing and prevents the production of the repressor form. We propose that Sgg/GSK3 acts in conjunction with PKA to cause hyperphosphorylation of Ci, which targets it for proteolytic processing, and that Hh opposes Ci proteolysis by promoting its dephosphorylation.
Precise regulation of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) family of transcription factors (NFAT1-4) is essential for vertebrate development and function. In resting cells, NFAT proteins are heavily phosphorylated and reside in the cytoplasm; in cells exposed to stimuli that raise intracellular free Ca2+ levels, they are dephosphorylated by the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and translocate to the nucleus. NFAT dephosphorylation by calcineurin is countered by distinct NFAT kinases, among them casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Here we have used a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila to identify additional regulators of the signalling pathway leading from Ca2+-calcineurin to NFAT. This screen was successful because the pathways regulating NFAT subcellular localization (Ca2+ influx, Ca2+-calmodulin-calcineurin signalling and NFAT kinases) are conserved across species, even though Ca2+-regulated NFAT proteins are not themselves represented in invertebrates. Using the screen, we have identified DYRKs (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinases) as novel regulators of NFAT. DYRK1A and DYRK2 counter calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT1 by directly phosphorylating the conserved serine-proline repeat 3 (SP-3) motif of the NFAT regulatory domain, thus priming further phosphorylation of the SP-2 and serine-rich region 1 (SRR-1) motifs by GSK3 and CK1, respectively. Thus, genetic screening in Drosophila can be successfully applied to cross evolutionary boundaries and identify new regulators of a transcription factor that is expressed only in vertebrates.
Activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by membrane depolarization triggers a variety of key cellular responses, such as contraction in heart and smooth muscle and exocytotic secretion in endocrine and nerve cells. Modulation of calcium channel gating is believed to be the mechanism by which several neurotransmitters, hormones and therapeutic agents mediate their effects on cell function. Here we describe a novel type of voltage-dependent equilibrium between different gating patterns of dihydropyridine-sensitive (L-type) cardiac Ca2+ channels. Strong depolarizations drive the channel from its normal gating pattern into a mode of gating characterized by long openings and high open probability. The rate constants for conversions between gating modes, estimated from single channel recordings, are much slower than normal channel opening and closing rates, but the equilibrium between modes is almost as steeply voltage-dependent as channel activation and deactivation at more negative potentials. This new mechanism of voltage-dependent gating can explain previous reports of activity-dependent Ca2+ channel potentiation in cardiac and other cells and forms a potent mechanism by which Ca2+ uptake into cells could be regulated.
Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex of freely moving rats provide a strikingly periodic representation of self-location which is indicative of very specific computational mechanisms. However, the existence of grid cells in humans and their distribution throughout the brain are unknown. Here we show that the preferred firing directions of directionally modulated grid cells in rat entorhinal cortex are aligned with the grids, and that the spatial organization of grid-cell firing is more strongly apparent at faster than slower running speeds. Because the grids are also aligned with each other, we predicted a macroscopic signal visible to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. We then looked for this signal as participants explored a virtual reality environment, mimicking the rats' foraging task: fMRI activation and adaptation showing a speed-modulated six-fold rotational symmetry in running direction. The signal was found in a network of entorhinal/subicular, posterior and medial parietal, lateral temporal and medial prefrontal areas. The effect was strongest in right entorhinal cortex, and the coherence of the directional signal across entorhinal cortex correlated with spatial memory performance. Our study illustrates the potential power of combining single-unit electrophysiology with fMRI in systems neuroscience. Our results provide evidence for grid-cell-like representations in humans, and implicate a specific type of neural representation in a network of regions which supports spatial cognition and also autobiographical memory.
Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved cell suicide process executed by cysteine proteases (caspases) and regulated by the opposing factions of the Bcl-2 protein family. Mammalian caspase-9 and its activator Apaf-1 were thought to be essential, because mice lacking either of them display neuronal hyperplasia and their lymphocytes and fibroblasts seem resistant to certain apoptotic stimuli. Because Apaf-1 requires cytochrome c to activate caspase-9, and Bcl-2 prevents mitochondrial cytochrome c release, Bcl-2 is widely believed to inhibit apoptosis by safeguarding mitochondrial membrane integrity. Our results suggest a different, broader role, because Bcl-2 overexpression increased lymphocyte numbers in mice and inhibited many apoptotic stimuli, but the absence of Apaf-1 or caspase-9 did not. Caspase activity was still discernible in cells lacking Apaf-1 or caspase-9, and a potent caspase antagonist both inhibited apoptosis and retarded cytochrome c release. We conclude that Bcl-2 regulates a caspase activation programme independently of the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 'apoptosome', which seems to amplify rather than initiate the caspase cascade.
Intracellular recordings were made from locally thermosensitive preoptic neurons in the green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus. Stable resting potentials, action potentials, and spontaneous synaptic activity were observed over approximately 4 degrees to 5 degrees C changes in local brain temperature. A small percentage of the warm-sensitive neurons showed exponential firing-rate responses to temperature. These cells discharged rhythmically, lacked visible synaptic input, and showed slowly depolarizing potentials leading to action potentials. Other linear and nonlinear warm-sensitive and cold-sensitive neurons showed spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials giving rise to action potentials. Cells that appear to be endogenously active may be true thermodetectors, and other thermosensitive neuronal activity may be synaptically mediated.
The recognition that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), rather than the mitochondria, is the main organelle regulating the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in non-muscle cells supports the notion that an alternative physiological role of mitochondrial Ca transport is the modulation of Ca-sensitive mitochondrial enzymes through small (micromolar) fluctuations in the concentration of mitochondrial matrix Ca2+. The latter mechanism could operate only if the mitochondrial Ca concentration were low, as it is in muscle and retinal rods, below the levels saturating the regulated enzymes. In contrast, if the ER serves as an intracellular Ca store, its Ca content would be expected to be high. In view of the major metabolic function of the liver, the question of whether hepatic mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ regulates metabolism is particularly important, but the range of Ca concentrations reported for isolated liver mitochondria is too wide to provide a conclusive answer. Therefore, we have used electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) to measure the subcellular distribution of Ca in liver snap-frozen in vivo, and report here that the endoplasmic reticulum is a major intracellular store of Ca, while the concentration of Ca in mitochondria is low and compatible with the regulation of mitochondrial enzymes.
Neurogenesis normally only occurs in limited areas of the adult mammalian brain--the hippocampus, olfactory bulb and epithelium, and at low levels in some regions of macaque cortex. Here we show that endogenous neural precursors can be induced in situ to differentiate into mature neurons, in regions of adult mammalian neocortex that do not normally undergo any neurogenesis. This differentiation occurs in a layer- and region-specific manner, and the neurons can re-form appropriate corticothalamic connections. We induced synchronous apoptotic degeneration of corticothalamic neurons in layer VI of anterior cortex of adult mice and examined the fates of dividing cells within cortex, using markers for DNA replication (5-bromodeoxyuridine; BrdU) and progressive neuronal differentiation. Newly made, BrdU-positive cells expressed NeuN, a mature neuronal marker, in regions of cortex undergoing targeted neuronal death and survived for at least 28 weeks. Subsets of BrdU+ precursors expressed Doublecortin, a protein found exclusively in migrating neurons, and Hu, an early neuronal marker. Retrograde labelling from thalamus demonstrated that BrdU+ neurons can form long-distance corticothalamic connections. Our results indicate that neuronal replacement therapies for neurodegenerative disease and CNS injury may be possible through manipulation of endogenous neural precursors in situ.
Asymmetric cell division is a general process used in many developmental contexts to create two differently fated cells from a single progenitor cell. Intrinsic mechanisms like the asymmetric transmission of cell-fate determinants during cell division, and extrinsic cell-interaction mechanisms, can mediate asymmetric divisions. During embryonic development of the Drosophila central nervous system, neural stem cells called neuroblasts divide asymmetrically to produce another multipotent neuroblast and a ganglion mother cell (GMC) of more restricted developmental potential. Intrinsic mechanisms promote asymmetric division of neuroblasts: for example, the transcription factor Prospero localizes to the basal cell cortex of mitotic neuroblasts and then segregates exclusively into the GMC, which buds off from the basal side of the neuroblast. In the GMC, Prospero translocates to the nucleus, where it establishes differential gene expression between sibling cells. Here we report the identification of a gene, miranda, which encodes a new protein that co-localizes with Prospero in mitotic neuroblasts, tethers Prospero to the basal cortex of mitotic neuroblasts, directing Prospero into the GMC, and releases Prospero from the cell cortex within GMCs. miranda thus creates intrinsic differences between sibling cells by mediating the asymmetric segregation of a transcription factor into only one daughter cell during neural stem-cell division.
Impulsivity, describing action without foresight, is an important feature of several psychiatric diseases, suicidality and violent behaviour. The complex origins of impulsivity hinder identification of the genes influencing it and the diseases with which it is associated. Here we perform exon-focused sequencing of impulsive individuals in a founder population, targeting fourteen genes belonging to the serotonin and dopamine domain. A stop codon in HTR2B was identified that is common (minor allele frequency > 1%) but exclusive to Finnish people. Expression of the gene in the human brain was assessed, as well as the molecular functionality of the stop codon, which was associated with psychiatric diseases marked by impulsivity in both population and family-based analyses. Knockout of Htr2b increased impulsive behaviours in mice, indicative of predictive validity. Our study shows the potential for identifying and tracing effects of rare alleles in complex behavioural phenotypes using founder populations, and indicates a role for HTR2B in impulsivity.
Long-term potentiation of chemical synapses is closely related to memory and learning. Studies of this process have concentrated on chemically mediated excitatory synapses. By contrast, activity-dependent modification of gap junctions, which also widely exist in higher structures such as hippocampus and neocortex, has not been described. Here we report that at mixed synapses between sensory afferents and an identified reticulospinal neuron, the electrotonic coupling potential can be potentiated, as well as the chemically mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential, for a prolonged time period using a stimulation paradigm like that which produces long-term potentiation in hippocampus. The effect on coupling is due to an increase in gap-junctional conductance. Our data indicate that the potentiation of both synaptic components requires an increase in intracellular calcium, involves activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, and is specific to the tetanized pathway.
Migration of neurons from proliferative zones to their functional sites is fundamental to the normal development of the central nervous system. Mice homozygous for the spontaneous rostral cerebellar malformation mutation (rcm(s)) or a newly identified transgenic insertion allele (rcm(tg)) exhibit cerebellar and midbrain defects, apparently as a result of abnormal neuronal migration. Laminar structure abnormalities in lateral regions of the rostral cerebellar cortex have been described in homozygous rcm(s) mice. We now demonstrate that the cerebellum of both rcm(s) and rcm(tg) homozygotes is smaller and has fewer folia than in the wild-type, ectopic cerebellar cells are present in midbrain regions by three days after birth, and there are abnormalities in postnatal cerebellar neuronal migration. We have cloned the rcm complementary DNA, which encodes a transmembrane receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The sequence of the rcm protein (Rcm) is highly similar to that of UNC-5, a Caenorhabditis elegans protein that is essential for dorsal guidance of pioneer axons and for the movement of cells away from the netrin ligand, which is encoded by the unc-6 gene. As Rcm is a member of a newly described family of vertebrate homologues of UNC-5 which are netrin-binding proteins, our results indicate that UNC-5-like proteins may have a conserved function in mediating netrin-guided migration.
The close relationship between activation of blood coagulation and cancer is an old enigma. In 1865, migrans trombophlebitis ('a condition of the blood that predisposes it to spontaneous coagulation') was described as a forewarning of occult malignancy (Trousseau's sign). This pioneering observation emphasized the existence of haemostasis disorders associated with cancer onset; this phenomenon has since been extensively reported in clinical and epidemiological studies, but has so far resisted a mechanistic explanation. Here we report a mouse model of sporadic tumorigenesis based on genetic manipulation of somatic cells. Targeting the activated, human MET oncogene to adult liver caused slowly progressing hepatocarcinogenesis. This was preceded and accompanied by a syndrome manifesting first with blood hypercoagulation (venous thromboses), and then evolving towards fatal internal haemorrhages. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is driven by the transcriptional response to the oncogene, including prominent upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) genes. In vivo analysis showed that both proteins support the thrombohaemorrhagic phenotype, thus providing direct genetic evidence for the long-sought-after link between oncogene activation and haemostasis.
In fission yeast the onset of mitosis is brought about by Cdc2/Cdc13 kinase, which is inhibited by the Wee1/Mik1 tyrosine kinases and activated by Cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase. This control network integrates many signals, including those that monitor DNA replication, DNA damage and cell size. We report here that a fission yeast MAP kinase pathway links the cell-cycle G2/M control with changes in the extracellular environment that affect cell physiology. Fission yeast spc1- mutants have a G2 delay that is greatly exacerbated by growth in high osmolarity media and nutrient limitation. A lethal interaction of spc1 and cdc25 mutations shows that Spc1 promotes the onset of mitosis. Spc1 is a MAP kinase homologue that is activated by Wis1 kinase in response to osmotic stress and nutrient limitation. Spc1 is inactivated by Pyp1, a phosphatase previously identified as a mitotic inhibitor. Pyp1 dephosphorylates only tyrosine-173 of Spc1, unlike the dual-specificity phosphatases that have been shown to regulate other MAP kinases.
Advances in genetics and genomics have fuelled a revolution in discovery-based, or hypothesis-generating, research that provides a powerful complement to the more directly hypothesis-driven molecular, cellular and systems neuroscience. Genetic and functional genomic studies have already yielded important insights into neuronal diversity and function, as well as disease. One of the most exciting and challenging frontiers in neuroscience involves harnessing the power of large-scale genetic, genomic and phenotypic data sets, and the development of tools for data integration and mining. Methods for network analysis and systems biology offer the promise of integrating these multiple levels of data, connecting molecular pathways to nervous system function.
Carbon monoxide, an activator of guanylyl cyclase, is formed by the action of the enzyme heme oxygenase. By in situ hybridization in brain slices, discrete neuronal localization of messenger RNA for the constitutive form of heme oxygenase throughout the brain has been demonstrated. This localization is essentially the same as that for soluble guanylyl cyclase messenger RNA. In primary cultures of olfactory neurons, zinc protoporphyrin-9, a potent selective inhibitor of heme oxygenase, depletes endogenous guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). Thus, carbon monoxide, like nitric oxide, may be a physiologic regulator of cGMP. These findings, together with the neuronal localizations of heme oxygenase, suggest that carbon monoxide may function as a neurotransmitter.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. We previously mapped a locus for a rare familial form of PD to chromosome 1p36 (PARK6). Here we show that mutations in PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1) are associated with PARK6. We have identified two homozygous mutations affecting the PINK1 kinase domain in three consanguineous PARK6 families: a truncating nonsense mutation and a missense mutation at a highly conserved amino acid. Cell culture studies suggest that PINK1 is mitochondrially located and may exert a protective effect on the cell that is abrogated by the mutations, resulting in increased susceptibility to cellular stress. These data provide a direct molecular link between mitochondria and the pathogenesis of PD.
Tau proteins aggregate as cytoplasmic inclusions in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and hereditary frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Over 10 exonic and intronic mutations in the tau gene have been identified in about 20 FTDP-17 families. Analyses of soluble and insoluble tau proteins from brains of FTDP-17 patients indicated that different pathogenic mutations differentially altered distinct biochemical properties and stoichiometry of brain tau isoforms. Functional assays of recombinant tau proteins with different FTDP-17 missense mutations implicated all but one of these mutations in disease pathogenesis by reducing the ability of tau to bind microtubules and promote microtubule assembly.
The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.
In cats with midsagittal section of the optic chiasm, some visual cortex neurons can be driven not only by the ipsilateral eye, through the direct geniculocortical pathways, but also by the contralateral eye, through the opposite visual cortex and corpus callosum. The receptive fields and the response characteristics observed upon stimulation of the contralateral eye are very similar to those observed upon stimulation of the ipsilateral eye; the two monocular receptive fields of a given cell lie in corresponding points of heteronymous halves of the visual field in close contact with the vertical meridian, thus adding in visual space and forming a binocular receptive area which crosses the vertical meridian and extends equally on either side of it.
Years of intensive investigation have yielded a sophisticated understanding of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced in hippocampal area CA1 by high-frequency stimulation (HFS). These efforts have been motivated by the belief that similar synaptic modifications occur during memory formation, but it has never been shown that learning actually induces LTP in CA1. We found that one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning in rats produced the same changes in hippocampal glutamate receptors as induction of LTP with HFS and caused a spatially restricted increase in the amplitude of evoked synaptic transmission in CA1 in vivo. Because the learning-induced synaptic potentiation occluded HFS-induced LTP, we conclude that inhibitory avoidance training induces LTP in CA1.
Sensorimotor coordination emerges early in development. The maturation period is characterized by the establishment of somatotopic cortical maps, the emergence of long-range cortical connections, heightened experience-dependent plasticity and spontaneous uncoordinated skeletal movement. How these various processes cooperate to allow the somatosensory system to form a three-dimensional representation of the body is not known. In the visual system, interactions between spontaneous network patterns and afferent activity have been suggested to be vital for normal development. Although several intrinsic cortical patterns of correlated neuronal activity have been described in developing somatosensory cortex in vitro, the in vivo patterns in the critical developmental period and the influence of physiological sensory inputs on these patterns remain unknown. We report here that in the intact somatosensory cortex of the newborn rat in vivo, spatially confined spindle bursts represent the first and only organized network pattern. The localized spindles are selectively triggered in a somatotopic manner by spontaneous muscle twitches, motor patterns analogous to human fetal movements. We suggest that the interaction between movement-triggered sensory feedback signals and self-organized spindle oscillations shapes the formation of cortical connections required for sensorimotor coordination.
Intracellular electrical recordings in an in vitro slice preparation of the brainstem medial pontine reticular formation, a region thought to be important in mediation of desynchronized sleep phenomena, demonstrate a population of neurons that have a calcium-dependent, low threshold spike. This low threshold spike was inactivated at relatively depolarized membrane potential levels and, when this spike was deinactivated, it induced a burst of action potentials. The membrane potential dependence of the spike may underlie changes in action potential firing patterns associated with behavioral state change because the baseline membrane potential in neurons of the medial pontine reticular population depolarizes during passage from waking and slow wave sleep to desynchronized sleep, which is characterized by the absence of burst firing.
A neuroimaging study examined the neural correlates of social exclusion and tested the hypothesis that the brain bases of social pain are similar to those of physical pain. Participants were scanned while playing a virtual ball-tossing game in which they were ultimately excluded. Paralleling results from physical pain studies, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was more active during exclusion than during inclusion and correlated positively with self-reported distress. Right ventral prefrontal cortex (RVPFC) was active during exclusion and correlated negatively with self-reported distress. ACC changes mediated the RVPFC-distress correlation, suggesting that RVPFC regulates the distress of social exclusion by disrupting ACC activity.
Engulfment and subsequent degradation of apoptotic cells is an essential step that occurs throughout life in all multicellular organisms. ELMO/Dock180/Rac proteins are a conserved signalling module for promoting the internalization of apoptotic cell corpses; ELMO and Dock180 function together as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac, and thereby regulate the phagocyte actin cytoskeleton during engulfment. However, the receptor(s) upstream of the ELMO/Dock180/Rac module are still unknown. Here we identify brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) as a receptor upstream of ELMO and as a receptor that can bind phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. BAI1 is a seven-transmembrane protein belonging to the adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptor family, with an extended extracellular region and no known ligands. We show that BAI1 functions as an engulfment receptor in both the recognition and subsequent internalization of apoptotic cells. Through multiple lines of investigation, we identify phosphatidylserine, a key 'eat-me' signal exposed on apoptotic cells, as a ligand for BAI1. The thrombospondin type 1 repeats within the extracellular region of BAI1 mediate direct binding to phosphatidylserine. As with intracellular signalling, BAI1 forms a trimeric complex with ELMO and Dock180, and functional studies suggest that BAI1 cooperates with ELMO/Dock180/Rac to promote maximal engulfment of apoptotic cells. Last, decreased BAI1 expression or interference with BAI1 function inhibits the engulfment of apoptotic targets ex vivo and in vivo. Thus, BAI1 is a phosphatidylserine recognition receptor that can directly recruit a Rac-GEF complex to mediate the uptake of apoptotic cells.
Null mutations of glass specifically remove photoreceptor cells, leaving other cell types intact. We have isolated the glass gene and have shown that its transcript encodes a putative protein of 604 amino acids with five zinc-fingers. The glass product may be a transcription factor required for the development of a single neuronal cell type.
Paradoxical, concurrent hyper-and hyporeactivity of a profound nature to specific stimuli occurred when 10 micrograms of morphine was microinjected bilaterally into the periaqueductal gray matter of the rat brain. Both effects at this site were dose-dependent. The hyperreactivity (to previously neutral auditory and visual stimuli) was obtained only with intracerebrally injected morphine and never with intraperitoneally injected morphine or with other opiates administered either way. Rapid tolerance to toxic doses of morphine developed at this site, as well as cross tolerance of the hyporeactivity to painful stimuli between routes (intracerebral to intraperitoneal) of morphine administration. Both the hyper- and hyporeactivity were fully reversible by intracerebral injection of naloxone in the periaqueductal gray. Thus, the periaqueductal gray appears to be a major pathway for morphine action.
Symbiotic root nodules are beneficial to leguminous host plants; however, excessive nodulation damages the host because it interferes with the distribution of nutrients in the plant. To keep a steady balance, the nodulation programme is regulated systemically in leguminous hosts. Leguminous mutants that have lost this ability display a hypernodulating phenotype. Through the use of reciprocal and self-grafting studies using Lotus japonicus hypernodulating mutants, har1 (also known as sym78), we show that the shoot genotype is responsible for the negative regulation of nodule development. A map-based cloning strategy revealed that HAR1 encodes a protein with a relative molecular mass of 108,000, which contains 21 leucine-rich repeats, a single transmembrane domain and serine/threonine kinase domains. The har1 mutant phenotype was rescued by transfection of the HAR1 gene. In a comparison of Arabidopsis receptor-like kinases, HAR1 showed the highest level of similarity with CLAVATA1 (CLV1). CLV1 negatively regulates formation of the shoot and floral meristems through cell-cell communication involving the CLV3 peptide. Identification of hypernodulation genes thus indicates that genes in leguminous plants bearing a close resemblance to CLV1 regulate nodule development systemically, by means of organ-organ communication.
The type I interferon response protects cells against invading viral pathogens. The cellular factors that mediate this defence are the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago, only a few have been characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system.
The release of glutamate during brain anoxia or ischaemia triggers the death of neurons, causing mental or physical handicap. The mechanism of glutamate release is controversial, however. Four release mechanisms have been postulated: vesicular release dependent on external calcium or Ca2+ released from intracellular stores; release through swelling-activated anion channels; an indomethacin-sensitive process in astrocytes; and reversed operation of glutamate transporters. Here we have mimicked severe ischaemia in hippocampal slices and monitored glutamate release as a receptor-gated current in the CA1 pyramidal cells that are killed preferentially in ischaemic hippocampus. Using blockers of the different release mechanisms, we demonstrate that glutamate release is largely by reversed operation of neuronal glutamate transporters, and that it plays a key role in generating the anoxic depolarization that abolishes information processing in the central nervous system a few minutes after the start of ischaemia. A mathematical model incorporating K+ channels, reversible uptake carriers and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor channels reproduces the main features of the response to ischaemia. Thus, transporter-mediated glutamate homeostasis fails dramatically in ischaemia: instead of removing extracellular glutamate to protect neurons, transporters release glutamate, triggering neuronal death.
The ontogeny of neurotransmitters in autonomic neurons proceeds through the successive stages of early expression, definitive expression, modulation, and regulation, extending from embryonic life to maturity. Although different extracellular signals influence development at different stages, a number of signals that influence development continue to govern transmitter function during maturity. The sequential ontogenetic stages parallel the progressive restriction of mutability of phenotypic expression; however, some degree of neuronal mutability appears to persist through maturity.
Synapses, the junctions between nerve cells through which they communicate, are formed by the coordinated assembly and tight attachment of pre- and postsynaptic specializations. We now show that SynCAM is a brain-specific, immunoglobulin domain-containing protein that binds to intracellular PDZ-domain proteins and functions as a homophilic cell adhesion molecule at the synapse. Expression of the isolated cytoplasmic tail of SynCAM in neurons inhibited synapse assembly. Conversely, expression of full-length SynCAM in nonneuronal cells induced synapse formation by cocultured hippocampal neurons with normal release properties. Glutamatergic synaptic transmission was reconstituted in these nonneuronal cells by coexpressing glutamate receptors with SynCAM, which suggests that a single type of adhesion molecule and glutamate receptor are sufficient for a functional postsynaptic response.
A sudden increase in permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane, the so-called mitochondrial permeability transition, is a common feature of apoptosis and is mediated by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP). It is thought that the mtPTP is a protein complex formed by the voltage-dependent anion channel, members of the pro- and anti-apoptotic BAX-BCL2 protein family, cyclophilin D, and the adenine nucleotide (ADP/ATP) translocators (ANTs). The latter exchange mitochondrial ATP for cytosolic ADP and have been implicated in cell death. To investigate the role of the ANTs in the mtPTP, we genetically inactivated the two isoforms of ANT in mouse liver and analysed mtPTP activation in isolated mitochondria and the induction of cell death in hepatocytes. Mitochondria lacking ANT could still be induced to undergo permeability transition, resulting in release of cytochrome c. However, more Ca2+ than usual was required to activate the mtPTP, and the pore could no longer be regulated by ANT ligands. Moreover, hepatocytes without ANT remained competent to respond to various initiators of cell death. Therefore, ANTs are non-essential structural components of the mtPTP, although they do contribute to its regulation.
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) activates a class of excitatory amino acid receptor involved in a variety of plastic and pathological processes in the brain. Quantitative study of the NMDA receptor has been difficult in mammalian neurons, because it usually exists with other excitatory amino acid receptors of overlapping pharmacological specificities. Xenopus oocytes injected with messenger RNA isolated from primary cultures of rat brain have now been used to study NMDA receptors. The distinguishing properties of neuronal NMDA receptors have been reproduced in this amphibian cell, including voltage-dependent block by magnesium, block by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, and potentiation by glycine. This preparation should facilitate the quantitative study of the regulation of NMDA receptor activation and serve as a tool for purification of the encoding messenger RNA.
In several species, the peripheral input from the eyes partly determines the pattern of interconnections between the visual areas of the two cerebral hemispheres through the fibre tract termed the corpus callosum. In the macaque monkey, the neurons projecting through the callosum are largely restricted to area 18 throughout ontogeny, whereas area 17 is characterized by few or no callosal projections. Here, we show that suppressing the peripheral input by prenatal removal of the eyes leads to a marked reduction in the extent of area 17, resulting in a large shift in the position of the histologically identifiable boundary between the two areas. Even so, the boundary continues to separate an area rich with callosal connections (area 18) from one poor in such projections (area 17), indicating there is no effect on the callosal connectivity of area 17. In contrast, in area 18, eye removal results in many more neurons with callosal projections than in normal animals. The results suggest that the factors that determine the parcellation of cortical areas also specify their connectivity.
CKAMP44, identified here by a proteomic approach, is a brain-specific type I transmembrane protein that associates with AMPA receptors in synaptic spines. CKAMP44 expressed in Xenopus oocytes reduced GluA1- and A2-mediated steady-state currents, but did not affect kainate- or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated currents. Mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons expressed CKAMP44 at low abundance, and overexpression of CKAMP44 led to stronger and faster AMPA receptor desensitization, slower recovery from desensitization, and a reduction in the paired-pulse ratio of AMPA currents. By contrast, dentate gyrus granule cells exhibited strong CKAMP44 expression, and CKAMP44 knockout increased the paired-pulse ratio of AMPA currents in lateral and medial perforant path-granule cell synapses. CKAMP44 thus modulates short-term plasticity at specific excitatory synapses.
At early stages of the mammalian visual cortex, neurons with similar stimulus selectivities are vertically arrayed through the thickness of the cortical sheet and clustered in patches or bands across the surface. This organization, referred to as a 'column', has been found with respect to one-dimensional stimulus parameters such as orientation of stimulus contours, eye dominance of visual inputs, and direction of stimulus motion. It is unclear, however, whether information with extremely high dimensions, such as visual shape, is organized in a similar columnar fashion or in a different manner in the brain. Here we report that the anterior inferotemporal area of the monkey cortex, the final station of the visual cortical stream crucial for object recognition, consists of columns, each containing cells responsive to similar visual features of objects.
The cyc- variants of S49 lymphoma cells have served as powerful tools for studying the components and mechanisms of hormone-induced adenylate cyclase stimulation, as these cells are deficient in the guanine nucleotide regulatory site (Ns) mediating hormone, guanine nucleotide, cholera toxin and fluoride-induced stimulations of the enzyme. Because of this deficiency, membranes of these cells have been used for reconstitution of the system by inserting the coupling component derived from other cell types. The hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase is not only stimulated by hormones but can also be inhibited by a wide variety of hormones and neurotransmitters, and there is some evidence that hormonal inhibition may be mediated by a distinct guanine nucleotide regulatory site. Studies in cyc- cells lacking a functional Ns may therefore answer this unresolved, important question. We have recently observed that stable GTP analogues can inhibit cyc- adenylate cyclase stimulated by purified, preactivated Ns or forskolin, which can activate adenylate cyclase even in the absence of a functional Ns (ref. 10). The data indicated that these Ns-deficient cells contain an inhibitory guanine nucleotide site, Ni. To strengthen this concept, we investigated whether the cyc- adenylate cyclase can be inhibited by a hormone. We report here that somatostatin decreases cyclic AMP levels in cyc- cells, inhibits the forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase and causes a concomitant increase in a high affinity GTPase activity in cyc- membranes. The data strongly suggest that both the hormone- and guanine nucleotide-induced adenylate cyclase inhibitions in cyc- cells are mediated by Ni and that the mechanisms of activation and inactivation of Ni are similar to those established for Ns.
In rat hippocampal pyramidal cells tested in situ by iontophoresis of several neurotransmitters, ethanol significantly enhanced excitatory responses to acetylcholine and inhibitory responses to somatostatin-14 but had no statistically significant effect on excitatory responses to glutamate or inhibitory responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid or, in preliminary tests, to norepinephrine or serotonin. The effects of ethanol on responses to acetylcholine and somatostatin-14 may provide insight into synaptic mechanisms underlying the behavioral consequences of ethanol intoxication.
Precise wiring of the nervous system depends on coordinating the action of conserved families of proteins that direct axons to their appropriate targets. Slit-roundabout repulsion and netrin-deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) (frazzled) attraction must be tightly regulated to control midline axon guidance in vertebrates and invertebrates, but the mechanism mediating this regulation is poorly defined. Here, we show that the Fra receptor has two genetically separable functions in regulating midline guidance in Drosophila. First, Fra mediates canonical chemoattraction in response to netrin, and, second, it functions independently of netrin to activate commissureless transcription, allowing attraction to be coupled to the down-regulation of repulsion in precrossing commissural axons.
EMS, a blastomere of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, produces body wall muscle cell-autonomously in isolation. Within the embryonic context, however, the specification of body wall muscle derived from EMS depends on inductive interactions between its daughter MS and ABa descendants that are required to overcome inhibitory interactions with other cells. The inductive events between the MS and ABa descendants are reciprocal, specifying subsequent fates in both lineages. Both induction events are blocked by mutations in the gene glp-1, known to encode a Notch-like transmembrane receptor protein.
The clinical manifestations of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) often include neuropsychiatric and neurological deficits, including early memory loss and progressive dementia. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the aetiological agent of AIDS, is probably carried by infected macrophages in the central nervous system. The virus enters cells by binding its envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the CD4 antigen present on brain and immune cells. From the data reported in this paper, we now suggest that the neuronal deficits associated with HIV may not be entirely a result of infectivity, but that gp120 shed from HIV could directly produce the neuropathology as a result of its interference with endogenous neurotrophic substances. It is known that an analogue of a sequence contained in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) occurs in all known sequenced gp120 isolates and that VIP is important for neuronal survival in cell culture. Here we show that purified gp120 from two diverse HIV isolates and a recombinant gp120 from a third isolate were all potent in specifically producing significant neuronal cell death in dissociated hippocampal cultures derived from fetal mice, and that this could be reduced by monoclonal antibodies against the murine CD4 antigen and completely antagonized by VIP.
The expression of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) genes is generally thought to be regulated by the combination of the VH promoter with the enhancer element which is located in the JH-CH intron. This is probably an oversimplification: there are cell lines that transcribe IgH genes despite the deletion of the intron-enhancer. These findings could imply that other enhancer element(s) exist in the IgH locus. Here we show that a strong B-cell-specific enhancer is indeed located at the 3'-end of the rat IgH locus, 25 kilobases downstream of C alpha. This enhancer should be retained downstream of all rearranged IgH genes, regardless of the VH or CH segment used. Taken together with analogous findings for the mouse kappa locus, the results prompt a re-evaluation of the mechanism of regulation of immunoglobulin gene transcription. Furthermore, unlike the intron-enhancer, the IgH 3' enhancer would become linked to a c-myc that rearranges into an IgH switch region. The IgH 3' enhancer could therefore play a part in the activation of the translocated c-myc genes in rat immunocytomas, mouse plasmacytomas and Burkitt lymphomas.
Sodium-potassium activated adenosine triphosphatase activity was found to be almost twice as high in renal medulla as in cortex. Infusion of digoxin, a specific inhibitor of the enzyme, into one renal artery of the dog resulted in unilateral natriuresis, impaired concentrating capacity, and reduction of the enzyme activity in both cortex and medulla. It is suggested that the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase plays an important role in urine concentration mechanisms.
Cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) often mediate antagonistic cellular actions of extracellular factors, from the regulation of ion channels to cell volume control and axon guidance. We found that localized cAMP and cGMP activities in undifferentiated neurites of cultured hippocampal neurons promote and suppress axon formation, respectively, and exert opposite effects on dendrite formation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging showed that alterations of the amount of cAMP resulted in opposite changes in the amount of cGMP, and vice versa, through the activation of specific phosphodiesterases and protein kinases. Local elevation of cAMP in one neurite resulted in cAMP reduction in all other neurites of the same neuron. Thus, local and long-range reciprocal regulation of cAMP and cGMP together ensures coordinated development of one axon and multiple dendrites.
A family of highly polymorphic neuronal cell surface proteins, the neurexins, has been identified. At least two genes for neurexins exist. Each gene uses alternative promoters and multiple variably spliced exons to potentially generate more than a 100 different neurexin transcripts. The neurexins were discovered by the identification of one member of the family as the receptor for alpha-latrotoxin. This toxin is a component of the venom from black widow spiders; it binds to presynaptic nerve terminals and triggers massive neurotransmitter release. Neurexins contain single transmembrane regions and extracellular domains with repeated sequences similar to sequences in laminin A, slit, and agrin, proteins that have been implicated in axon guidance and synaptogenesis. An antibody to neurexin I showed highly concentrated immunoreactivity at the synapse. The polymorphic structure of the neurexins, their neural localization, and their sequence similarity to proteins associated with neurogenesis suggest a function as cell recognition molecules in the nerve terminal.
These are comments written by the Governing Council of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM), the primary international organization dedicated to neuroimaging research. The purpose of these comments is to identify and frame issues concerning data sharing within the neuroimaging community. Data sharing has become an important issue in most fields of science. The neuroimaging community is no exception, and it clearly perceives potential benefits in such efforts, as have been realized in other fields such as genomics. At the same time, such efforts can be costly (both in time and expense), and there are important factors that differentiate brain imaging from other fields and that pose specific challenges to the generation of useful neuroimaging databases. These include the rapid pace of change in brain imaging technologies; the complexity of the variables that must be specified to meaningfully interpret the results (such as the method of image acquisition, behavioral design, and subject characteristics); and concerns about participant confidentiality. These issues are outlined with the goal of framing and promoting a public discussion of the benefits and risks of data sharing, which can inform the field of neuroimaging as well as others that face similar challenges.
Distinctive acute brain damage involving limbic and related brain regions develops in adult rats following sustained limbic seizures induced by systemic administration of kainic acid or dipiperidinoethane (DPE) or by intra-amygdaloid injection of kainic acid or folic acid. This seizure-brain damage (S-BD) syndrome is of particular interest because it tends to parallel the type of seizures and brain damage seen in human temporal lobe epilepsy. We have observed that DPE induces the S-BD syndrome by systemic but not intra-mygdaloid injection, whereas an oxidized DPE derivative which structurally resembles the cholinergic agonist oxotremorine is effective when injected into the amygdala. Prompted by this finding, we injected known acetylcholine (ACh) agonists and cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors into the rat amygdala and found that either class of agent reproduces this type of S-BD syndrome. These and related findings suggest that ACh mechanisms might have a more important role in human epilepsy and epileptic brain damage than has generally been appreciated.
Ionizing radiation represents the most effective therapy for glioblastoma (World Health Organization grade IV glioma), one of the most lethal human malignancies, but radiotherapy remains only palliative because of radioresistance. The mechanisms underlying tumour radioresistance have remained elusive. Here we show that cancer stem cells contribute to glioma radioresistance through preferential activation of the DNA damage checkpoint response and an increase in DNA repair capacity. The fraction of tumour cells expressing CD133 (Prominin-1), a marker for both neural stem cells and brain cancer stem cells, is enriched after radiation in gliomas. In both cell culture and the brains of immunocompromised mice, CD133-expressing glioma cells survive ionizing radiation in increased proportions relative to most tumour cells, which lack CD133. CD133-expressing tumour cells isolated from both human glioma xenografts and primary patient glioblastoma specimens preferentially activate the DNA damage checkpoint in response to radiation, and repair radiation-induced DNA damage more effectively than CD133-negative tumour cells. In addition, the radioresistance of CD133-positive glioma stem cells can be reversed with a specific inhibitor of the Chk1 and Chk2 checkpoint kinases. Our results suggest that CD133-positive tumour cells represent the cellular population that confers glioma radioresistance and could be the source of tumour recurrence after radiation. Targeting DNA damage checkpoint response in cancer stem cells may overcome this radioresistance and provide a therapeutic model for malignant brain cancers.
Ion channels formed by the TRP (transient receptor potential) superfamily of proteins act as sensors for temperature, osmolarity, mechanical stress and taste. The growth cones of developing axons are responsible for sensing extracellular guidance factors, many of which trigger Ca2+ influx at the growth cone; however, the identity of the ion channels involved remains to be clarified. Here, we report that TRP-like channel activity exists in the growth cones of cultured Xenopus neurons and can be modulated by exposure to netrin-1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, two chemoattractants for axon guidance. Whole-cell recording from growth cones showed that netrin-1 induced a membrane depolarization, part of which remained after all major voltage-dependent channels were blocked. Furthermore, the membrane depolarization was sensitive to blockers of TRP channels. Pharmacological blockade of putative TRP currents or downregulation of Xenopus TRP-1 (xTRPC1) expression with a specific morpholino oligonucleotide abolished the growth-cone turning and Ca2+ elevation induced by a netrin-1 gradient. Thus, TRPC currents reflect early events in the growth cone's detection of some extracellular guidance signals, resulting in membrane depolarization and cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation that mediates the turning of growth cones.
During the development of the mammalian brain, neuronal precursors migrate to their final destination from their site of birth in the ventricular and subventricular zones (VZ and SVZ, respectively). SVZ cells in the walls of the lateral ventricle continue to proliferate in the brain of adult mice and can generate neurons in vitro, but their fate in vivo is unknown. Here SVZ cells from adult mice that carry a neuronal-specific transgene were grafted into the brain of adult recipients. In addition, the fate of endogenous SVZ cells was examined by microinjection of tritiated thymidine or a vital dye that labeled a discrete population of SVZ cells. Grafted and endogenous SVZ cells in the lateral ventricle of adult mice migrate long distances and differentiate into neurons in the olfactory bulb.
It is widely accepted that individual neurons in the central nervous system release only a single fast transmitter. The possibility of corelease of fast neurotransmitters was examined by making paired recordings from synaptically connected neurons in spinal cord slices. Unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents generated at interneuron-motoneuron synapses consisted of a strychnine-sensitive, glycine receptor-mediated component and a bicuculline-sensitive, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor-mediated component. These results indicate that spinal interneurons release both glycine and GABA to activate functionally distinct receptors in their postsynaptic target cells. A subset of miniature synaptic currents also showed both components, consistent with corelease from individual synaptic vesicles.
Hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials have been discovered in fibers of the "jumping" muscle of the grasshopper. These potentials attenuate the depolarizing excitatory postsynaptic responses. They are enhanced during depolarization of the muscle fiber with applied current and are diminished and then reversed during hyperpolarization. The electrogenesisappears to be caused by chloride-activation. Gamma-aminobutyric acid activates the inhibitorysynaptic membrane and picrotoxin is an inactivator agent.
State-dependent learning is a phenomenon in which the retrieval of newly acquired information is possible only if the subject is in the same sensory context and physiological state as during the encoding phase. In spite of extensive behavioural and pharmacological characterization, no cellular counterpart of this phenomenon has been reported. Here we describe a neuronal analogue of state-dependent learning in which cortical neurons show an acetylcholine-dependent expression of an acetylcholine-induced functional plasticity. This was demonstrated on neurons of rat somatosensory 'barrel' cortex, whose tunings to the temporal frequency of whisker deflections were modified by cellular conditioning. Pairing whisker stimulation with acetylcholine applied iontophoretically yielded selective lasting modification of responses, the expression of which depended on the presence of exogenous acetylcholine. Administration of acetylcholine during testing revealed frequency-specific changes in response that were not expressed when tested without acetylcholine or when the muscarinic antagonist, atropine, was applied concomitantly. Our results suggest that both acquisition and recall can be controlled by the cortical release of acetylcholine.
We have postulated that an excitatory postsynaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) may open voltage-sensitive K+ ('M') channels, in an appropriate depolarizing range, and that this could alter the e.p.s.p. waveform. Consequently, the fast e.p.s.p. in neurones of sympathetic ganglia, elicited by a nicotinic action of acetylcholine (ACh), could be followed by a hyperpolarization, produced by the opening of M channels during the depolarizing e.p.s.p. and their subsequent slow closure (time constant-150 mg). This introduces the concept that transmitter-induced p.s.ps may trigger voltage-sensitive conductances other than those initiating action potentials, and that in the present case this could produce a true post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization. (Some hyperpolarizations other than inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (i.p.s.ps) have been reported to follow e.p.s.ps.) We show here that this is so.
Genetic linkage analysis of rats that were selectively bred for alcohol preference identified a chromosomal region that includes the neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene. Alcohol-preferring rats have lower levels of NPY in several brain regions compared with alcohol-non-preferring rats. We therefore studied alcohol consumption by mice that completely lack NPY as a result of targeted gene disruption. Here we report that NPY-deficient mice show increased consumption, compared with wild-type mice, of solutions containing 6%, 10% and 20% (v/v) ethanol. NPY-deficient mice are also less sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol, as shown by more rapid recovery from ethanol-induced sleep, even though plasma ethanol concentrations do not differ significantly from those of controls. In contrast, transgenic mice that overexpress a marked NPY gene in neurons that usually express it have a lower preference for ethanol and are more sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of this drug than controls. These data are direct evidence that alcohol consumption and resistance are inversely related to NPY levels in the brain.
Morphologically normal plants were regenerated from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia cells transformed with an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain containing a tumor-inducing plasmid with a chimeric gene for kanamycin resistance. The presence of the chimeric gene in regenerated plants was demonstrated by Southern hybridization analysis, and its expression in plant tissues was confirmed by the ability of leaf segments to form callus on media containing kanamycin at concentrations that were normally inhibitory. Progeny derived from several transformed plants inherited the foreign gene in a Mendelian manner.
Microglia, brain immune cells, engage in the clearance of dead cells or dangerous debris, which is crucial to the maintenance of brain functions. When a neighbouring cell is injured, microglia move rapidly towards it or extend a process to engulf the injured cell. Because cells release or leak ATP when they are stimulated or injured, extracellular nucleotides are thought to be involved in these events. In fact, ATP triggers a dynamic change in the motility of microglia in vitro and in vivo, a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying microglial chemotaxis; in contrast, microglial phagocytosis has received only limited attention. Here we show that microglia express the metabotropic P2Y6 receptor whose activation by endogenous agonist UDP triggers microglial phagocytosis. UDP facilitated the uptake of microspheres in a P2Y6-receptor-dependent manner, which was mimicked by the leakage of endogenous UDP when hippocampal neurons were damaged by kainic acid in vivo and in vitro. In addition, systemic administration of kainic acid in rats resulted in neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, where increases in messenger RNA encoding P2Y6 receptors that colocalized with activated microglia were observed. Thus, the P2Y6 receptor is upregulated when neurons are damaged, and could function as a sensor for phagocytosis by sensing diffusible UDP signals, which is a previously unknown pathophysiological function of P2 receptors in microglia.
A potential treatment for paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury is to route control signals from the brain around the injury by artificial connections. Such signals could then control electrical stimulation of muscles, thereby restoring volitional movement to paralysed limbs. In previously separate experiments, activity of motor cortex neurons related to actual or imagined movements has been used to control computer cursors and robotic arms, and paralysed muscles have been activated by functional electrical stimulation. Here we show that Macaca nemestrina monkeys can directly control stimulation of muscles using the activity of neurons in the motor cortex, thereby restoring goal-directed movements to a transiently paralysed arm. Moreover, neurons could control functional stimulation equally well regardless of any previous association to movement, a finding that considerably expands the source of control signals for brain-machine interfaces. Monkeys learned to use these artificial connections from cortical cells to muscles to generate bidirectional wrist torques, and controlled multiple neuron-muscle pairs simultaneously. Such direct transforms from cortical activity to muscle stimulation could be implemented by autonomous electronic circuitry, creating a relatively natural neuroprosthesis. These results are the first demonstration that direct artificial connections between cortical cells and muscles can compensate for interrupted physiological pathways and restore volitional control of movement to paralysed limbs.
Retinal dopamine-containing amacrine neurons are rapidly activated by light, as shown by an increase in the rate of dopamine formation in vivo and a concomitant increase in the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, measured in vitro with a subsaturating concentration of pteridine cofactor. Activation of tyrosine hydroxylase also occurs when isolated eyes from rats killed in the dark are exposed to a strobe light. Studies of amacrine neurons should provide basic data about the biochemical processing of visual information, as well as the physiological presynaptic regulatory mechanisms of dopamine-containing neurons.
Natural killer (NK) cells are classically viewed as lymphocytes that provide innate surveillance against virally infected cells and tumour cells through the release of cytolytic mediators and interferon (IFN)-gamma. In humans, blood CD56(dim) NK cells specialize in the lysis of cell targets. In the lymph nodes, CD56(bright) NK cells secrete IFN-gamma cooperating with dendritic cells and T cells in the generation of adaptive responses. Here we report the characterization of a human NK cell subset located in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, such as tonsils and Peyer's patches, which is hard-wired to secrete interleukin (IL)-22, IL-26 and leukaemia inhibitory factor. These NK cells, which we refer to as NK-22 cells, are triggered by acute exposure to IL-23. In vitro, NK-22-secreted cytokines stimulate epithelial cells to secrete IL-10, proliferate and express a variety of mitogenic and anti-apoptotic molecules. NK-22 cells are also found in mouse mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and appear in the small intestine lamina propria during bacterial infection, suggesting that NK-22 cells provide an innate source of IL-22 that may help constrain inflammation and protect mucosal sites.
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a principal Ser/Thr phosphatase, the deregulation of which is associated with multiple human cancers, Alzheimer's disease and increased susceptibility to pathogen infections. How PP2A is structurally organized and functionally regulated remains unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of an AB'C heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzyme. The structure reveals that the HEAT repeats of the scaffold A subunit form a horseshoe-shaped fold, holding the catalytic C and regulatory B' subunits together on the same side. The regulatory B' subunit forms pseudo-HEAT repeats and interacts with the C subunit near the active site, thereby defining substrate specificity. The methylated carboxy-terminal tail of the C subunit interacts with a highly negatively charged region at the interface between A and B' subunits, suggesting that the C-terminal carboxyl methylation of the C subunit promotes B' subunit recruitment by neutralizing charge repulsion. Together, our structural results establish a crucial foundation for understanding PP2A assembly, substrate recruitment and regulation.
Histamine is a neuromodulator in the brain, and the hippocampus is one of the regions of the brain that is innervated by histaminergic neurons. When applied to cultured hippocampal neurons, histamine selectively increased by up to tenfold the amplitude of the component of synaptic transmission that was mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Spontaneous miniature synaptic currents and the current elicited by applied NMDA also were enhanced, indicating that the histamine effect was expressed primarily postsynaptically. These results suggest that histamine may modulate processes involving NMDA receptors, such as the induction of long-term potentiation.
Considerable evidence indicates that a stimulus that is subthreshold, and thus consciously invisible, influences brain activity and behavioral performance. However, it is not clear how subthreshold stimuli are processed in the brain. We found that a task-irrelevant subthreshold coherent motion led to a stronger disturbance in task performance than did suprathreshold motion. With the subthreshold motion, activity in the visual cortex measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging was higher, but activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex was lower, than with suprathreshold motion. These results suggest that subthreshold irrelevant signals are not subject to effective inhibitory control.
Rats with electrodes implanted in the medial forebrain bundle stimulated their own brains at sharply reduced rates after systemic administration of disulfiram or intraventricular administration of diethyldithiocarbamate. Both drugs inhibit dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the final step in the biosynthesis of norepinephrine. The suppressed behavior was reinstated by intraventricular injections of 1-norepinephrine, but not by injection of its biologically inactive isomer, d-norepinephrine. Intraventricular administration of dopamine and serotonin did not restore self-stimulation. The rewarding effect of medial forebrain bundle stimulation may depend on the availability of norepinephrine as a transmitter, but not on dopamine or serotonin.
During gastrulation in vertebrates, ectodermal cells choose between two fates, neural and epidermal. The nervous system forms in response to signals from the Spemann organizer; ectoderm that does not receive these signals becomes epidermis. Unexpectedly, however, in Xenopus, neural tissue also forms when cell-cell communication within the ectoderm is disrupted by cell dissociation or by antagonists of the growth factor activin. These observations suggest that epidermal specification depends on local signalling, by activin or a close relative, and that neural tissue forms when this communication is blocked. Here we report that bone morphogenesis protein 4 (Bmp-4), a relative of activin that is expressed in the embryo at the time of ectodermal fate determination, is a potent epidermal inducer and neural inhibitor, the first reported in any vertebrate. Activin can inhibit neuralization by inducing mesoderm, but does not induce epidermis. Moreover, the dominant-negative activin receptor, which stimulates neuralization when expressed in the embryo, blocks Bmp-4 in our assay. Our findings demonstrate that epidermal fate can be induced, and thus provide further evidence that neural specification is under inhibitory control in vertebrates.
The exuberant growth of neurites during development becomes markedly reduced as cortical neurons mature. In vitro studies of neurons from mouse cerebral cortex revealed that contact-mediated Notch signaling regulates the capacity of neurons to extend and elaborate neurites. Up-regulation of Notch activity was concomitant with an increase in the number of interneuronal contacts and cessation of neurite growth. In neurons with low Notch activity, which readily extend neurites, up-regulation of Notch activity either inhibited extension or caused retraction of neurites. Conversely, in more mature neurons that had ceased their growth after establishing numerous connections and displayed high Notch activity, inhibition of Notch signaling promoted neurite extension. Thus, the formation of neuronal contacts results in activation of Notch receptors, leading to restriction of neuronal growth and a subsequent arrest in maturity.
A myelin-associated protein from the central nervous system, the neurite growth inhibitor NI-35, inhibits regeneration of lesioned neuronal fiber tracts in vivo and growth of neurites in vitro. Growth cones of cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons arrested their growth and collapsed when exposed to liposomes containing NI-35. Before morphological changes, the concentration of free intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) showed a rapid and large increase in growth cones exposed to liposomes containing NI-35. Neither an increase in [Ca2+]i nor collapse of growth cones was detected in the presence of antibodies to NI-35. Dantrolene, an inhibitor of calcium release from caffeine-sensitive intracellular calcium stores, protected growth cones from collapse evoked by NI-35. Depletion of these caffeine-sensitive intracellular calcium stores prevented the increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by NI-35. The NI-35-evoked cascade of intracellular messengers that mediates collapse of growth cones includes the crucial step of calcium release from intracellular stores.
A defect in the transport of L-cystine and L-lysine has been found in the intestinal mucosa of patients with cystinuria. Transport studies in normal intestinal mucosa, in contrast to similar studies in the kidney, show that cystine and lysine are mutually inhibitory.
Many object-related actions can be recognized by their sound. We found neurons in monkey premotor cortex that discharge when the animal performs a specific action and when it hears the related sound. Most of the neurons also discharge when the monkey observes the same action. These audiovisual mirror neurons code actions independently of whether these actions are performed, heard, or seen. This discovery in the monkey homolog of Broca's area might shed light on the origin of language: audiovisual mirror neurons code abstract contents-the meaning of actions-and have the auditory access typical of human language to these contents.
Prior incubation of rat anterior pituitary cells with 17beta-estradiol led to an almost complete reversal of the inhibitory effect of two dopamine agonists, dihydroergocornine and RU 24213, on both basal prolactin release and thyrotropin releasing hormone-induced prolactin release. These experiments thus demonstrate a direct interference of dopamine action by a peripheral hormone. Prolactin secretion by pituitary cells in primary culture could possibly serve as an easily accessible model of a system under dopaminergic control.
Constitutive Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activity is associated with initiation of neoplasia, but its role in the continued growth of established tumors is unclear. Here, we investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the Hh pathway antagonist cyclopamine in preclinical models of medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Cyclopamine treatment of murine medulloblastoma cells blocked proliferation in vitro and induced changes in gene expression consistent with initiation of neuronal differentiation and loss of neuronal stem cell-like character. This compound also caused regression of murine tumor allografts in vivo and induced rapid death of cells from freshly resected human medulloblastomas, but not from other brain tumors, thus establishing a specific role for Hh pathway activity in medulloblastoma growth.
Blood pressure is critically controlled by angiotensins, which are vasopressor peptides specifically released by the enzyme renin from the tail of angiotensinogen-a non-inhibitory member of the serpin family of protease inhibitors. Although angiotensinogen has long been regarded as a passive substrate, the crystal structures solved here to 2.1 A resolution show that the angiotensin cleavage site is inaccessibly buried in its amino-terminal tail. The conformational rearrangement that makes this site accessible for proteolysis is revealed in our 4.4 A structure of the complex of human angiotensinogen with renin. The co-ordinated changes involved are seen to be critically linked by a conserved but labile disulphide bridge. Here we show that the reduced unbridged form of angiotensinogen is present in the circulation in a near 40:60 ratio with the oxidized sulphydryl-bridged form, which preferentially interacts with receptor-bound renin. We propose that this redox-responsive transition of angiotensinogen to a form that will more effectively release angiotensin at a cellular level contributes to the modulation of blood pressure. Specifically, we demonstrate the oxidative switch of angiotensinogen to its more active sulphydryl-bridged form in the maternal circulation in pre-eclampsia-the hypertensive crisis of pregnancy that threatens the health and survival of both mother and child.
The human brain is found to produce a magnetic field near the scalp which varies in synchrony with periodic electrical stimulation applied to a finger. Use of a highly sensitive superconducting quantum interference device as a magnetic field detector reveals that the brain's field is sharply localized over the primary projection area of the sensory cortex contralateral to the digit being stimulated. The phase of the response at the stimulus frequency varies monotonically with the repetition rate and at intermediate frequencies yields a latency of approximately 70 milliseconds for cortical response.
Box turtles were implanted with thermodes astride the preoptic tissue of the brainstem. The rate of evaporative water loss could be transiently increased by heating the rostral brainstem. Heating tissue in the anterior hypothalamus affected evaporative water loss only a high ambient temperatures. The magnitude of the response was proportional both to the change in hypothalamic temperature and to the ambient temperature with which the turtle was in equilibrium. The major fuction of a high rate of evaporative water loss in turtles is probably to protect the brain from overheating during thermal stress.
Tourette syndrome, a chronic tic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance, exhibits considerable phenotypic variability even within monozygotic twin pairs. The origins of this variability remain unclear. Recent findings have implicated the caudate nucleus as a locus of pathology, and pharmacological evidence supports dopaminergic involvement. Within monozygotic twins discordant for Tourette syndrome severity, differences in D2 dopamine receptor binding in the head of the caudate nucleus predicted differences in phenotypic severity (r = 0.99); this relation was not observed in putamen. These data may link Tourette syndrome with a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve associative striatal circuitry.
Responses of norepiniephrine sensitive adeniosinie 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-generating systems in combined midbrain-striatal slices of four rat strains correlate positively with spontaneous behavioral activity and negatively with levels of midbrain and striatal tyrosine hydroxylase. Responses of cerebral cortical norepinephrine-sensitive cyclic AMP systems correlate negatively with spontaneous behavioral activity antd positively with midbrain and striatal tyrosine hydroxylase. Such correlations were not found with responses of the cyclic AMP- generatinlg systems to isoproterenol, adenosine. veratridine or of an adenosne and norepinephrine combination.
The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine produced a permanent loss of endogenous norepinephrine and of 3H-labeled norepinephrine uptake sites in the hippocampus within 5 days. These losses were initially accompanied by parallel decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase activity and synaptosomal norepinephrine synthesis. Within 21 days, however, hippocampal tyrosine hydroxylase activity and norepinephrine synthesis rate increased three- to fivefold. These data suggest a novel form of plasticity in brain-damaged animals characterized by an increase in the capacity for transmitter biosynthesis in residual neurons.
The striatum, which is the major component of the basal ganglia in the brain, is regulated in part by dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra. Severe movement disorders result from the loss of striatal dopamine in patients with Parkinson's disease. Rats with lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) serve as a model for Parkinson's disease and show alterations in gene expression in the two major output systems of the striatum to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Striatopallidal neurons show a 6-OHDA-induced elevation in their specific expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the D2 dopamine receptor and enkephalin, which is reversed by subsequent continuous treatment with the D2 agonist quinpirole. Conversely, striatonigral neurons show a 6-OHDA-induced reduction in their specific expression of mRNAs encoding the D1 dopamine receptor and substance P, which is reversed by subsequent daily injections of the D1 agonist SKF-38393. This treatment also increases dynorphin mRNA in striatonigral neurons. Thus, the differential effects of dopamine on striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons are mediated by their specific expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, respectively.
The proto-oncogene bcl-2, isolated from the t(14;18) chromosomal breakpoint in follicular B-lymphoma, and a bcl-2-related gene bcl-x (ref. 4) prevent apoptotic cell death induced by various treatments. Although a mechanism has been proposed that involves Bcl-2 activity on reactive oxygen species (ROS), expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL prevents cell death induced by withdrawal of oxygen (hypoxia), which drastically decreases the net formation of oxygen free radicals and does not increase oxidized lipid, protein or DNA. Furthermore, neither ROS scavenger nor inhibitor of ROS scavenger affects cell death, regardless of the expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Thus our data suggest that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL exert an anti-cell death function by a mechanism other than regulation of ROS activity.
The left cerebral hemisphere is dominant for language, and many aspects of language use are more impaired by damage to the left than the right hemisphere. The basis for this asymmetry, however, is a matter of debate; the left hemisphere may be specialized for processing linguistic information or for some more general function on which language depends, such as the processing of rapidly changing temporal information or execution of complex motor patterns. To investigate these possibilities, we examined the linguistic abilities of 23 sign-language users with unilateral brain lesions. Despite the fact that sign language relies on visuospatial rather than rapid temporal information, the same left-hemispheric dominance emerged. Correlation analyses of the production of sign language versus non-linguistic hand gestures suggest that these processes are largely independent. Our findings support the view that the left-hemisphere dominance for language is not reducible solely to more general sensory or motor processes.
Blood coagulation can be initiated when factor VII or VIIa, a plasma protease, binds to its essential cofactor, tissue factor (TF), and proteolytically activates factors IX and X, triggering a cascade of events which eventually leads to the formation of thrombin and a fibrin clot. Plasma contains a lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) which inhibits activated factor X (Xa) directly and, in a Xa-dependent way, inhibits VII(a)/TF activity, presumably by forming a quaternary Xa/LACI/VII(a)/TF complex. Sequence analysis of complementary DNA clones has shown that LACI contains three tandemly repeated Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitory domains. To investigate the relationship between these Kunitz structures and LACI function, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to produce altered forms of LACI in which the residue at the active-site cleft of each Kunitz domain has been individually changed. The second Kunitz domain is required for efficient binding and inhibition of Xa, and both Kunitz domains 1 and 2 are required for the inhibition of VIIa/TF activity; but alteration of the active-site residue of the third Kunitz domain has no significant effect on either function. We propose that in the putative inhibitory complex, Kunitz domain 1 is bound to the active site of VII(a)/TF and that Kunitz domain 2 is bound to Xa's active site.
Myelodysplastic syndromes and related disorders (myelodysplasia) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms showing deregulated blood cell production with evidence of myeloid dysplasia and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia, whose pathogenesis is only incompletely understood. Here we report whole-exome sequencing of 29 myelodysplasia specimens, which unexpectedly revealed novel pathway mutations involving multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery, including U2AF35, ZRSR2, SRSF2 and SF3B1. In a large series analysis, these splicing pathway mutations were frequent (~45 to ~85%) in, and highly specific to, myeloid neoplasms showing features of myelodysplasia. Conspicuously, most of the mutations, which occurred in a mutually exclusive manner, affected genes involved in the 3'-splice site recognition during pre-mRNA processing, inducing abnormal RNA splicing and compromised haematopoiesis. Our results provide the first evidence indicating that genetic alterations of the major splicing components could be involved in human pathogenesis, also implicating a novel therapeutic possibility for myelodysplasia.
In the mouse olfactory system, each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses only one odorant receptor (OR) gene in a monoallelic and mutually exclusive manner. Such expression forms the genetic basis for OR-instructed axonal projection of OSNs to the olfactory bulb of the brain during development. Here, we identify an upstream cis-acting DNA region that activates the OR gene cluster in mouse and allows the expression of only one OR gene within the cluster. Deletion of the coding region of the expressed OR gene or a naturally occurring frame-shift mutation allows a second OR gene to be expressed. We propose that stochastic activation of only one OR gene within the cluster and negative feedback regulation by that OR gene product are necessary to ensure the one receptor-one neuron rule.
The mammalian superior cervical ganglion has been the classical preparation for studying cholinergic transmission between neurones. Recently, however, evidence has been presented showing that, in addition to the postsynaptic changes mediated via nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, there is a non-cholinergic component to transmission in this ganglion, as in frog paravertebral ganglia. In the rabbit superior cervical ganglion, Ashe and Libet recorded a late, slow excitatory postsynaptic potential in response to preganglionic nerve stimulation in the presence of nicotinic and muscarinic antagonists. We have found, in the rat superior cervical ganglion, that a postsynaptic biochemical consequence of preganglionic nerve stimulation, namely the acute activation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH; EC 1.14.16.2), is mediated in part by acetylcholine and in part by a non-cholinergic neurotransmitter. The regulation of this enzyme activity is of particular interest because it catalyses the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of the postganglionic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline. In the present paper, we report that the relative importance of cholinergic and non-cholinergic transmission in the regulation of TH activity varies with the pattern of electrical stimulation of the preganglionic nerve trunk.
Naturally occurring peptides with biological actions have in most cases been detected by observing their biological activities in crude extracts and their isolation has been followed using bioassays. As a complement to the classical biological detection systems, we have proposed a chemical detection system based on fragmentation of peptides in tissue extracts followed by identification of certain of these peptide fragments having distinct chemical features. One such chemical feature is the C-terminal amide structure which is characteristic of many biologically active peptides. We have devised a chemical assay method for peptides having such a structure and have found several previously unknown peptide amides in procine upper small intestinal tissues. We report here the isolation and characterization of two of them, designated PHI and PYY. PHI is related to secretin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP, glucagon and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP); PYY is related to the pancreatic polypeptide and to neurotensin. Both peptides exhibit biological activities and appear to be present not only in the intestine but also in brain.
Categorization is a process by which the brain assigns meaning to sensory stimuli. Through experience, we learn to group stimuli into categories, such as 'chair', 'table' and 'vehicle', which are critical for rapidly and appropriately selecting behavioural responses. Although much is known about the neural representation of simple visual stimulus features (for example, orientation, direction and colour), relatively little is known about how the brain learns and encodes the meaning of stimuli. We trained monkeys to classify 360 degrees of visual motion directions into two discrete categories, and compared neuronal activity in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas, two interconnected brain regions known to be involved in visual motion processing. Here we show that neurons in LIP--an area known to be centrally involved in visuo-spatial attention, motor planning and decision-making-robustly reflect the category of motion direction as a result of learning. The activity of LIP neurons encoded directions of motion according to their category membership, and that encoding shifted after the monkeys were retrained to group the same stimuli into two new categories. In contrast, neurons in area MT were strongly direction selective but carried little, if any, explicit category information. This indicates that LIP might be an important nexus for the transformation of visual direction selectivity to more abstract representations that encode the behavioural relevance, or meaning, of stimuli.
Electrical stimulation of the centrifugal fibers to the avian retina can disturb the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory system within the receptive fields of individual retinal ganglion cells. Although the mechanisms may vary from one unit to another, the effect is always to make them fire more readily and to a wider range of visual inputs.
Progressive cerebral deposition of the 39-43-amino-acid amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is an invariant feature of Alzheimer's disease which precedes symptoms of dementia by years or decades. The only specific molecular defects that cause Alzheimer's disease which have been identified so far are missense mutations in the gene encoding the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in certain families with an autosomal dominant form of the disease (familial Alzheimer's disease, or FAD). These mutations are located within or immediately flanking the A beta region of beta-APP, but the mechanism by which they cause the pathological phenotype of early and accelerated A beta deposition is unknown. Here we report that cultured cells which express a beta-APP complementary DNA bearing a double mutation (Lys to Asn at residue 595 plus Met to Leu at position 596) found in a Swedish FAD family produce approximately 6-8-fold more A beta than cells expressing normal beta-APP. The Met 596 to Leu mutation is principally responsible for the increase. These data establish a direct link between a FAD genotype and the clinicopathological phenotype. Further, they confirm the relevance of the continuous A beta production by cultured cells for elucidating the fundamental mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.
Schizophrenia is believed to involve altered activation of dopamine receptors, and support for this hypothesis comes from the antipsychotic effect of antagonists of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). D2R is expressed most highly in the striatum, but most of the recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies have failed to show any change in D2R densities in the striatum of schizophrenics, raising the possibility that other receptors may also be involved. In particular, the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R), which is highly expressed in the prefrontal cortex, has been implicated in the control of working memory, and working memory dysfunction is a prominent feature of schizophrenia. We have therefore used PET to examine the distribution of D1R and D2R in brains of drug-naive or drug-free schizophrenic patients. Although no differences were observed in the striatum relative to control subjects, binding of radioligand to D1R was reduced in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics. This reduction was related to the severity of the negative symptoms (for instance, emotional withdrawal) and to poor performance in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. We propose that dysfunction of D1R signalling in the prefrontal cortex may contribute to the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia.
Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) are modulators of synaptic plasticity, oscillatory behavior, and rhythmic firing in brain regions such as the hippocampus. The distribution and lateral mobility of VDCCs on CA1 hippocampal neurons have been determined with biologically active fluorescent and biotinylated derivatives of the selective probe omega-conotoxin in conjunction with circular dityndallism, digital fluorescence imaging, and photobleach recovery microscopy. On noninnervated cell bodies, VDCCs were found to be organized in multiple clusters, whereas after innervation the VDCCs were concentrated and immobilized at synaptic contact sites. On dendrites, VDCC distribution was punctate and was interrupted by extensive bare regions or abruptly terminated. More than 85% of the dendritic VDCCs were found to be immobile by fluorescence photobleach recovery. Thus, before synaptic contact, specific mechanisms target, segregate, and immobilize VDCCs to neuronal cell bodies and to specialized dendritic sites. Regulation of this distribution may be critical in determining the firing activity and integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 neurons.
Presynaptic axonal differentiation is essential for synapse formation and the establishment of neuronal circuits. However, the mechanisms that coordinate presynaptic development in the brain are largely unknown. We found that the major mitotic E3 ubiquitin ligase Cdc20-anaphase promoting complex (Cdc20-APC) regulates presynaptic differentiation in primary postmitotic mammalian neurons and in the rat cerebellar cortex. Cdc20-APC triggered the degradation of the transcription factor NeuroD2 and thereby promoted presynaptic differentiation. The NeuroD2 target gene encoding Complexin II, which acts locally at presynaptic sites, mediated the ability of NeuroD2 to suppress presynaptic differentiation. Thus, our findings define a Cdc20-APC ubiquitin signaling pathway that governs presynaptic development, which holds important implications for neuronal connectivity and plasticity in the brain.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are phylogenetically widespread small RNAs of 18-25 nucleotides in length, and are found in animals and plants. These small RNAs can regulate gene expression at a translational level through interactions with their target messenger RNAs, and they have a role in the development of Caenorhabditis elegans and plants. Although more than two hundred miRNAs have been found in mammals, their mRNA targets remain to be identified. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of Hes1, basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor, is regulated by miRNA-23 (miR-23) in NT2 cells. miR-23 is almost complementary to part of the coding region, just upstream of the termination codon, of Hes1 mRNA. Reduction in the level of miR-23 by small interfering RNAs resulted in the accumulation of Hes1, and hindered the retinoic-acid-induced neuronal differentiation of NT2 cells. Thus, our results indicate that miR-23 regulates the expression of Hes1 at the post-transcriptional level, and participates in retinoic-acid-induced neuronal differentiation of NT2 cells.
The c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of the stress-activated group of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases that are implicated in the control of cell growth. A murine cytoplasmic protein that binds specifically to JNK [the JNK interacting protein-1 (JIP-1)] was characterized and cloned. JIP-1 caused cytoplasmic retention of JNK and inhibition of JNK-regulated gene expression. In addition, JIP-1 suppressed the effects of the JNK signaling pathway on cellular proliferation, including transformation by the Bcr-Abl oncogene. This analysis identifies JIP-1 as a specific inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway and establishes protein targeting as a mechanism that regulates signaling by stress-activated MAP kinases.
A juvenile Siamese cat with severe, progressive motor disability was shown to have extensive neuronal degeneration caused by accumulation of GM(1) ganglioside. Tissues from brain and kidney were markedly deficient in beta-galactosidase activity. The disease in this cat is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, and is strikingly similar to juvenile GM(1) gangliosidosis of children.
During mammalian brain development, immature neurons migrate radially from the neuroectoderm to defined locations, giving rise to characteristic cell layers. Here we show that targeted disruption of the mouse disabled1 (mdab1) gene disturbs neuronal layering in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. The gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein, mDab1 p80, which is expressed and tyrosine-phosphorylated in the developing nervous system. It is likely to be an adaptor protein, docking to others through its phosphotyrosine residues and protein-interacting domain. The mdab1 mutant phenotype is very similar to that of the reeler mouse. The product of the reeler gene, Reelin, is a secreted protein that has been proposed to act as an extracellular signpost for migrating neurons. Because mDab1 is expressed in wild-type cortical neurons, and Reelin expression is normal in mdab1 mutants, mDab1 may be part of a Reelin-regulated or parallel pathway that controls the final positioning of neurons.
Individual cellular clocks in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the circadian center, are integrated into a stable and robust pacemaker with a period length of about 24 hours. We used real-time analysis of gene expression to show synchronized rhythms of clock gene transcription across hundreds of neurons within the mammalian SCN in organotypic slice culture. Differentially phased neuronal clocks are topographically arranged across the SCN. A protein synthesis inhibitor set all cell clocks to the same initial phase and, after withdrawal, intrinsic interactions among cell clocks reestablished the stable program of gene expression across the assemblage. Na+-dependent action potentials contributed to establishing cellular synchrony and maintaining spontaneous oscillation across the SCN.
In the cat, the cortical arousal induced by reticular or nociceptive stimulation is more intense and more long-lasting after elimination of the caudal and medial part of the medulla than in preparations with intact brain. This difference is explained by the intervention of a phasic-ascending inhibitory bulbar control secondarily triggered by the mesencephalic activating system.
Endoplasmic reticulum-localized protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B terminates growth factor signal transduction by dephosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). But how PTP1B allows for RTK signaling in the cytoplasm is unclear. In order to test whether PTP1B activity is spatially regulated, we developed a method based on Forster resonant energy transfer for imaging enzyme-substrate (ES) intermediates in live cells. We observed the establishment of a steady-state ES gradient across the cell. This gradient exhibited robustness to cell-to-cell variability, growth factor activation, and RTK localization, which demonstrated spatial regulation of PTP1B activity. Such regulation may be important for generating distinct cellular environments that permit RTK signal transduction and that mediate its eventual termination.
Inhibitory non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) nerves are thought to be important in the autonomic innervation of the gastrointestinal tract and other organ systems. The nature of their neurotransmitter is still debated. Speculation that nitric oxide (NO), formed from L-arginine in neuronal structures and other cells, could act as a neurotransmitter, is not yet supported by demonstration of its release upon nerve stimulation. Using a superfusion bioassay, we report the release of a vasorelaxant factor upon stimulation of the NANC nerves in the canine ileocolonic junction. Several pieces of evidence, including the selectivity of the bioassay tissues, chemical instability, inactivation by superoxide anion and haemoglobin, inhibition by NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and potentiation by L-arginine all indicated that NO accounted for the biological activity of this transferable NANC factor.
Much is known about how people make decisions under varying levels of probability (risk). Less is known about the neural basis of decision-making when probabilities are uncertain because of missing information (ambiguity). In decision theory, ambiguity about probabilities should not affect choices. Using functional brain imaging, we show that the level of ambiguity in choices correlates positively with activation in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, and negatively with a striatal system. Moreover, striatal activity correlates positively with expected reward. Neurological subjects with orbitofrontal lesions were insensitive to the level of ambiguity and risk in behavioral choices. These data suggest a general neural circuit responding to degrees of uncertainty, contrary to decision theory.
There is growing evidence that the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin modulate complex social behavior and social cognition. These ancient neuropeptides display a marked conservation in gene structure and expression, yet diversity in the genetic regulation of their receptors seems to underlie natural variation in social behavior, both between and within species. Human studies are beginning to explore the roles of these neuropeptides in social cognition and behavior and suggest that variation in the genes encoding their receptors may contribute to variation in human social behavior by altering brain function. Understanding the neurobiology and neurogenetics of social cognition and behavior has important implications, both clinically and for society.
Long-term depression (LTD) is a well-known form of synaptic plasticity of principal neurons in the mammalian brain. Whether such changes occur in interneurons is still controversial. CA3 hippocampal interneurons expressing Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors exhibited LTD after tetanic stimulation of CA3 excitatory inputs. LTD was independent of NMDA receptors and required both Ca2+ influx through postsynaptic AMPA receptors and activation of presynaptic mGluR7-like receptors. These results point to the capability of interneurons to undergo plastic changes of synaptic strength through joint activation of pre- and postsynaptic glutamate receptors.
Two metabolites of the steroid hormones progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone and 3 alpha, 5 alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, are potent barbiturate-like ligands of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-chloride ion channel complex. At concentrations between 10(-7) and 10(-5)M both steroids inhibited binding of the convulsant t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to the GABA-receptor complex and increased the binding of the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam; they also stimulated chloride uptake (as measured by uptake of 36Cl-) into isolated brain vesicles, and potentiated the inhibitory actions of GABA in cultured rat hippocampal and spinal cord neurons. These data may explain the ability of certain steroid hormones to rapidly alter neuronal excitability and may provide a mechanism for the anesthetic and hypnotic actions of naturally occurring and synthetic anesthetic steroids.
Tumor progression is driven by genetic mutations, but little is known about the environmental conditions that select for these mutations. Studying the transcriptomes of paired colorectal cancer cell lines that differed only in the mutational status of their KRAS or BRAF genes, we found that GLUT1, encoding glucose transporter-1, was one of three genes consistently up-regulated in cells with KRAS or BRAF mutations. The mutant cells exhibited enhanced glucose uptake and glycolysis and survived in low-glucose conditions, phenotypes that all required GLUT1 expression. In contrast, when cells with wild-type KRAS alleles were subjected to a low-glucose environment, very few cells survived. Most surviving cells expressed high levels of GLUT1, and 4% of these survivors had acquired KRAS mutations not present in their parents. The glycolysis inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate preferentially suppressed the growth of cells with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Together, these data suggest that glucose deprivation can drive the acquisition of KRAS pathway mutations in human tumors.
Receptive fields of sensory cortical neurons are plastic, changing in response to alterations of neural activity or sensory experience. In this way, cortical representations of the sensory environment can incorporate new information about the world, depending on the relevance or value of particular stimuli. Neuromodulation is required for cortical plasticity, but it is uncertain how subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as the cholinergic nucleus basalis, interact with and refine cortical circuits. Here we determine the dynamics of synaptic receptive field plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex (also known as AI) using in vivo whole-cell recording. Pairing sensory stimulation with nucleus basalis activation shifted the preferred stimuli of cortical neurons by inducing a rapid reduction of synaptic inhibition within seconds, which was followed by a large increase in excitation, both specific to the paired stimulus. Although nucleus basalis was stimulated only for a few minutes, reorganization of synaptic tuning curves progressed for hours thereafter: inhibition slowly increased in an activity-dependent manner to rebalance the persistent enhancement of excitation, leading to a retuned receptive field with new preference for the paired stimulus. This restricted period of disinhibition may be a fundamental mechanism for receptive field plasticity, and could serve as a memory trace for stimuli or episodes that have acquired new behavioural significance.
The ability to distinguish colour from intensity variations is a difficult computational problem for the visual system because each of the three cone photoreceptor types absorb all wavelengths of light, although their peak sensitivities are at relatively short (S cones), medium (M cones), or long (L cones) wavelengths. The first stage in colour processing is the comparison of the outputs of different cone types by spectrally opponent neurons in the retina and upstream in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Some neurons receive opponent inputs from L and M cones, whereas others receive input from S cones opposed by combined signals from L and M cones. Here we report how the outputs of the L/M- and S-opponent geniculate cell types are combined in time at the next stage of colour processing, in the macaque primary visual cortex (V1). Some V1 neurons respond to a single chromatic region, with either a short (68-95 ms) or a longer (96-135 ms) latency, whereas others respond to two chromatic regions with a difference in latency of 20-30 ms. Across all types, short latency responses are mostly evoked by L/M-opponent inputs whereas longer latency responses are evoked mostly by S-opponent inputs. Furthermore, neurons with late S-cone inputs exhibit dynamic changes in the sharpness of their chromatic tuning over time. We propose that the sparse, S-opponent signal in the lateral geniculate nucleus is amplified in area V1, possibly through recurrent excitatory networks. This results in a delayed, sluggish cortical S-cone signal which is then integrated with L/M-opponent signals to rotate the lateral geniculate nucleus chromatic axes.
Oestrogen, an essential physiological regulator of reproductive function, controls lactotroph proliferation and prolactin release. The neuropeptide galanin co-localizes to the lactotroph, but its physiological function is largely unknown. Pituitary galanin expression is extremely sensitive to the oestrogen status of the animal. A marked elevation occurs during pregnancy and lactation, and exogenous 17 beta-oestradiol can cause a 4,000-fold increase in messenger RNA levels. Here we report that galanin is secreted by a minority of lactotrophs and is essential for the regulation of basal and vasoactive-intestinal-polypeptide-stimulated prolactin release. Hyperoestrogenization increases the number of galanin-secreting cells and the resulting increase in basal prolactin release is completely abolished by treatment with galanin antiserum. Galanin is a potent lactotroph growth factor and galanin-immunoneutralization completely inhibits the previously reported mitogenic effects of oestrogen on the lactotroph. These findings represent direct evidence for paracrine regulation of lactotroph function and demonstrate that the effect of oestrogen on lactotroph proliferation and prolactin release are mediated by locally secreted galanin.
We propose that the function of dream sleep (more properly rapid-eye movement or REM sleep) is to remove certain undesirable modes of interaction in networks of cells in the cerebral cortex. We postulate that this is done in REM sleep by a reverse learning mechanism (see also p. 158), so that the trace in the brain of the unconscious dream is weakened, rather than strengthened, by the dream.
Interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) processes an inactive precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta, and may regulate programmed cell death in neuronal cells. The high-resolution structure of human ICE in complex with an inhibitor has been determined by X-ray diffraction. The structure confirms the relationship between human ICE and cell-death proteins in other organisms. The active site spans both the 10 and 20K subunits, which associate to form a tetramer, suggesting a mechanism for ICE autoactivation.
We studied a large sample of male children from birth to adulthood to determine why some children who are maltreated grow up to develop antisocial behavior, whereas others do not. A functional polymorphism in the gene encoding the neurotransmitter-metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) was found to moderate the effect of maltreatment. Maltreated children with a genotype conferring high levels of MAOA expression were less likely to develop antisocial problems. These findings may partly explain why not all victims of maltreatment grow up to victimize others, and they provide epidemiological evidence that genotypes can moderate children's sensitivity to environmental insults.
When complexed with the intracellular protein FKBP12, rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressant and an inhibitor of a mitogen-stimulated signalling pathway that leads to activation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). A recently cloned FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP/RAFT) is the likely mediator of these effects. Using FRAP variants that do not bind FKBP12-rapamycin, we demonstrate here that FRAP is a rapamycin-sensitive regulator of p70S6k in vivo and that the kinase activity of FRAP is required for this regulation. In addition, we show that FRAP autophosphorylates in vitro. Consistent with an essential role for FRAP kinase activity in vivo, autophosphorylation of FRAP is inhibited by FKBP12-rapamycin. Deletion studies indicate that the kinase activity of FRAP alone is not sufficient for control of p70S6k and that an amino-terminal domain in FRAP is also required.
In human long-term memory, ideas and concepts become associated in the learning process. No neuronal correlate for this cognitive function has so far been described, except that memory traces are thought to be localized in the cerebral cortex; the temporal lobe has been assigned as the site for visual experience because electric stimulation of this area results in imagery recall and lesions produce deficits in visual recognition of objects. We previously reported that in the anterior ventral temporal cortex of monkeys, individual neurons have a sustained activity that is highly selective for a few of the 100 coloured fractal patterns used in a visual working-memory task. Here I report the development of this selectivity through repeated trials involving the working memory. The few patterns for which a neuron was conjointly selective were frequently related to each other through stimulus-stimulus association imposed during training. The results indicate that the selectivity acquired by these cells represents a neuronal correlate of the associative long-term memory of pictures.
Cortical neurons communicate with various cortical and subcortical targets by way of stereotyped axon projections through the white matter. Slice overlay experiments indicate that the initial growth of cortical axons toward the white matter is regulated by a diffusible chemorepulsive signal localized near the marginal zone. Semaphorin III is a major component of this diffusible signal, and cortical neurons transduce this signal by way of the neuropilin-1 receptor. These observations indicate that semaphorin-neuropilin interactions play a critical role in the initial patterning of projections in the developing cortex.
Small guanosine triphosphatases, typified by the mammalian Ras proteins, play major roles in the regulation of numerous cellular pathways. A subclass of evolutionarily conserved Ras-like proteins was identified, members of which differ from other Ras proteins in containing amino acids at positions 12 and 61 that are similar to those present in the oncogenic forms of Ras. These proteins, kappaB-Ras1 and kappaB-Ras2, interact with the PEST domains of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta [inhibitors of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)] and decrease their rate of degradation. In cells, kappaB-Ras proteins are associated only with NF-kappaB:IkappaBbeta complexes and therefore may provide an explanation for the slower rate of degradation of IkappaBbeta compared with IkappaBalpha.
Emotion is central to the quality and range of everyday human experience. The neurobiological substrates of human emotion are now attracting increasing interest within the neurosciences motivated, to a considerable extent, by advances in functional neuroimaging techniques. An emerging theme is the question of how emotion interacts with and influences other domains of cognition, in particular attention, memory, and reasoning. The psychological consequences and mechanisms underlying the emotional modulation of cognition provide the focus of this article.
Knowing when and where a given protein is activated within intact animals assists in elucidating its in vivo function. With the use of a genetically encoded A-probe (activation bioprobe), we revealed that Cdc42 guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) remains inactive within Drosophila embryos during the first two-thirds of embryogenesis. Within the central nervous system where Cdc42 activity first becomes up-regulated, individual neurons display patterns restricted to specific subcellular compartments. At both organismal and cellular levels, Cdc42's endogenous activation patterns in the wild type allow predictions of where loss-of-function phenotypes will emerge in cdc42/cdc42 mutants. Genetic tests support the importance of suppressing endogenous Cdc42 activities until needed. Thus, bioprobe-assisted analysis uncovers how ubiquitously expressed signaling proteins control cellular events through continual regulation of their activities within animals.
The mammalian neocortex is generated by waves of migrating cells originating from the ventricular zone. Radial migration along radial glia has been proposed as the dominant mechanism for this process. The radial unit hypothesis is poorly supported by retroviral lineage studies, however, and although some clones show limited radial organization, the emphasis appears to be on widespread tangential dispersion. Here we investigate the pattern of cortical cell dispersion using transgenic mice in which roughly half of the brain cells are coloured by a transgene. We find that the neocortex is randomly divided into diffused bands, the majority of cells within each band have the same colour, and their radial orientation suggests radial dispersion. Superimposed upon this was a significant contribution by tangentially dispersed cells that did not respect clonal borders. These observations indicate that cortical specification is not dependent upon a single mechanism of cell allocation, but that both radial mosaicism and tangential cell migration are involved.
Two color-separation positive transparencies of a scene, one projected with "red" light and the other with tungsten lamp light, were superimposed on a screen. The light was polarized so that an observer wearing an appropriate viewer could either see both images in each eye or the "red" image in one eye and the "white" image in the other. These two situations gave different results, not the same results, as some previous investigators have claimed. Land's major results cannot be "obtained stereoscopically." We conclude that the process by which color is formed could possibly be a process of the retina or the lateral geniculate body, and does not necessarily have to be a process of the cerebral cortex as implied by the binocular experiments which purported to give the fuller gamut of color.
Visual scenes are composed of many elements and although we can appreciate a scene as a whole, we can only move our eyes to one element of the scene at a time. As visual scenes become more complex, the number of potential targets in the scene increases, and the uncertainty that any particular one will be selected for an eye movement also increases. How motor systems accommodate this target uncertainty remains unknown. The activities of neurons in both the cerebral cortex and superior colliculus are modulated by this selection process. We reasoned that activity associated with target uncertainty should be evident in the saccadic motor system at the final stages of neural processing, in the superior colliculus. By systematically changing the number of stimuli from which a selection must be made and recording from superior colliculus neurons, we found that as the target uncertainty increased, the neural activity preceding target selection decreased. These results indicate that neurons within the final common pathway for movement generation are active well in advance of the selection of a particular movement. This early activity varies with the probability that a particular movement will be selected.
Calcium channels in excitable membranes are of great importance for many cellular functions. Modulation of these channels by neurotransmitters and drugs regulates calcium influx into the cell and thereby alters the functional state of the cell. Recently it has become possible to measure properties of single calcium channels directly and to obtain evidence on mechanisms of their modulation.
Defects in the NF1 gene have been implicated in the inherited disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized by several developmental abnormalities including an increased frequency of benign and malignant tumours of neural crest origin (neurofibromas and neurofibrosarcomas respectively). The NF1 gene encodes a ubiquitous protein homologous to p120GAP, the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the products of the ras protooncogenes. When expressed in non-mammalian systems, the region of the NF1 gene homologous to p120GAP produces a protein with GAP-like activity. Here we present evidence that the ras proteins in malignant tumour cell lines from patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis are in a constitutively activated state, as judged by the guanine nucleotide bound to them, and are necessary for cellular proliferation. These cells contain p21ras and p120GAP that are both functionally wild type, but barely any functional NF1 protein. Our results show that the NF1 protein is normally essential for correct negative regulation of ras proteins in the cell, even in the presence of normal p120GAP, and they support the hypothesis that NF1 is a tumour-suppressor gene whose product acts upstream of ras.
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and its neuron-specific regulator p35 are essential for neuronal migration and for the laminar configuration of the cerebral cortex. In addition, p35/Cdk5 kinase concentrates at the leading edges of axonal growth cones and regulates neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons in culture. The Rho family of small GTPases is implicated in a range of cellular functions, including cell migration and neurite outgrowth. Here we show that the p35/Cdk5 kinase co-localizes with Rac in neuronal growth cones. Furthermore, p35 associates directly with Rac in a GTP-dependent manner. Another Rac effector, Pak1 kinase, is also present in the Rac-p35/Cdk5 complexes and co-localizes with p35/Cdk5 and Rac at neuronal peripheries. The active p35/Cdk5 kinase causes Pak1 hyperphosphorylation in a Rac-dependent manner, which results in down-regulation of Pak1 kinase activity. Because the Rho family of GTPases and the Pak kinases are implicated in actin polymerization, the modification of Pak1, imposed by the p35/Cdk5 kinase, is likely to have an impact on the dynamics of the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in neurons, thus promoting neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth.
The Rho-family GTPase, Cdc42, can regulate the actin cytoskeleton through activation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family members. Activation relieves an autoinhibitory contact between the GTPase-binding domain and the carboxy-terminal region of WASP proteins. Here we report the autoinhibited structure of the GTPase-binding domain of WASP, which can be induced by the C-terminal region or by organic co-solvents. In the autoinhibited complex, intramolecular interactions with the GTPase-binding domain occlude residues of the C terminus that regulate the Arp2/3 actin-nucleating complex. Binding of Cdc42 to the GTPase-binding domain causes a dramatic conformational change, resulting in disruption of the hydrophobic core and release of the C terminus, enabling its interaction with the actin regulatory machinery. These data show that 'intrinsically unstructured' peptides such as the GTPase-binding domain of WASP can be induced into distinct structural and functional states depending on context.
It is well established that the administration of high doses of luteinizing hormone (LH) or human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) to animals can impair gonadal function in both the male and female. These effects can be duplicated by the administration of LH releasing hormone (LHRH) or its agonists to intact animals, including man. Somewhat surprisingly, recent results have demonstrated that similar impairment of gonadal function by LHRH and its agonists can be achieved in the absence of the pituitary (for review see ref. 7), and the demonstration of specific, high-affinity binding sites for LHRH and its agonists on ovarian luteal cells and on testicular Leydig cells, could mean that LHRH-like factors are involved in the local regulation of the gonads. A further intriguing finding is the striking similarity between the direct, inhibitory effects of LHRH and LH/HCG on the gonads; for example, both treatments reduce LH receptor numbers and the steroidogenic responsiveness of rat Leydig cells. We now offer a possible explanation for this similarity by demonstrating that HCG treatment stimulates the testicular production of a biologically active LHRH-like factor, suggesting that the inhibitory actions of HCG on the Leydig cell may be mediated by the local production of this factor.
Conflict monitoring by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been posited to signal a need for greater cognitive control, producing neural and behavioral adjustments. However, the very occurrence of behavioral adjustments after conflict has been questioned, along with suggestions that there is no direct evidence of ACC conflict-related activity predicting subsequent neural or behavioral adjustments in control. Using the Stroop color-naming task and controlling for repetition effects, we demonstrate that ACC conflict-related activity predicts both greater prefrontal cortex activity and adjustments in behavior, supporting a role of ACC conflict monitoring in the engagement of cognitive control.
Visual spatial resolution is limited by factors ranging from optics to neuronal filters in the visual cortex, but it is not known to what extent it is also limited by the resolving power of attention. To investigate this, we studied adaptation to lines of specific orientation, a process that occurs in primary visual cortex. When a single grating is presented in the periphery of the visual field, human observers are aware of its orientation, but when it is flanked by other similar gratings ('crowding'), its orientation becomes impossible to discern. Nevertheless, we show that orientation-specific adaptation is not affected by crowding, implying that spatial resolution is limited by an attentional filter acting beyond the primary visual cortex. Consistent with this, we find that attentional resolution is greater in the lower than in the upper visual field, whereas there is no corresponding asymmetry in the primary visual cortex. We suggest that the attentional filter acts in one or more higher visual cortical areas to restrict the availability of visual information to conscious awareness.
Pacemaker activity of spontaneously active neurons and heart cells is controlled by a depolarizing, mixed Na+/K+ current, named Ih (or I(f) in the sinoatrial node of the heart). This current is activated on hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. In addition to depolarizing pacemaker cells, Ih is involved in determining the resting membrane potential of neurons and provides a mechanism to limit hyperpolarizing currents in these cells. Hormones and neurotransmitters that induce a rise in cyclic AMP levels increase Ih by a mechanism that is independent of protein phosphorylation, and which involves direct binding of the cyclic nucleotide to the channel that mediates Ih. Here we report the molecular cloning and functional expression of the gene encoding a hyperpolarization-activated cation channel (HAC1) that is present in brain and heart. This channel exhibits the general properties of Ih channels. We have also identified full-length sequences of two related channels, HAC2 and HAC3, that are specifically expressed in the brain, indicating the existence of a family of hyperpolarization-activated cation channels.
d-Amphetamine is markedly more potent an inhibitor of catecholamine uptake by norepinephrine neurons in the brain than is 1-amphetamine, whereas the two isomers are equally active in inhibiting catecholamine uptake by the dopamine neurons of the corpus striatum. In behavioral studies, d-amphetamine is ten times as potent as 1-amphetamine in enhancing locomotor activity, while it is only twice as potent in eliciting a compulsive gnawing syndrome. This suggests that the locomotor stimulation induced by amphetamine involves central norepinephrine, while dopamine neurons play an important role in the induced compulsive gnawing behavior. Assessment of differential actions of d- and 1-amphetamine may be an efficient method to differentiate behaviors involving norepinephrine or dopamine in the brain.
Inbred tht strains Fischer 344 (F344) and Buffalo (BUF) differ in serveral physiological and behavioral measures. It was found that the activity of adrenomedullary and regional brain phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase is at least four times higher in F344 rats than in BUF rats; these strain-dependent differences corresponded directly with the epinephrine content of the medulla-pons and hypothalamus. Conversely, alpha-adrenergic receptor density in brain regions containing phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase is two to three times lower in F344 rats than in BUF rats; alpha-receptors in frontal cortex (a brain region lacking phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity and epinephrine) are similar in both strains. These findings suggest that strain-dependent differences in alpha-receptors are regulated by inherited differences in presynaptic adrenergic neuronal function in different brain regions.
A study of the anatomical distribution of the endogenous opioid dynorphin in rat brain showed that the peptide is localized in a widespread system with multiple cell groups and projections. This network is revealed by the use of multiple antiserums against dynorphin and can be distinguished from the system containing methionine-enkephalin and leucine-enkephalin, which is mapped by the use of antiserums against the enkephalins and biosynthetically related peptides in the adrenal. It thus appears that the brain contains at least three separate opioid neuronal networks: an enkephalin family with components similar to those found in the adrenal, a beta-endorphin family, and a dynorphin family.
Female birds that do not normally sing possess brain nuclei associated with song production in males. To determine whether one song nucleus, the caudal nucleus of the ventral hyperstriatum (HVc), acts in conspecific song perception, courtship responses of female canaries to canary and white-crowned sparrow songs were compared before and after HVc lesions. Bilateral lesions of a portion of the HVc resulted in copulation solicitations to heterospecific song as well as conspecific song. Control females continued to respond only to conspecific song. This suggests that the HVc is critical for conspecific song perception in females. Because female canaries do not normally sing, neurons in female HVc must develop response selectivity by a mechanism different from that proposed for male birds in the motor theory of song perception.
Recent neuroimagery findings showed that the patterns of cerebral activation during the mental rehearsal of a motor act are similar to those produced by its actual execution. This concurs with the notion that part of the distributed neural activity taking place during movement involves internal simulations, but it is not yet clear what specific contribution the different brain areas involved bring to this process. Here, patients with lesions restricted to the parietal cortex were found to be impaired selectively at predicting, through mental imagery, the time necessary to perform differentiated finger movements and visually guided pointing gestures, in comparison to normal individuals and to a patient with damage to the primary motor area. These results suggest that the parietal cortex is important for the ability to generate mental movement representations.
Environmental stimuli that signal the occurrence of aversive or dangerous events activate endogenous opiate analgesia systems. Signals for safety (the nonoccurrence of aversive events) produce the opposite and inhibit environmentally produced analgesia. Stimuli that signal safety are now shown to abolish the analgesic effect of morphine, even when morphine is applied directly to spinal cord. Further, this antiopiate effect occurs because the environmental stimulus leads to release of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin in the spinal cord. This process may contribute to the regulation of pain and the development of opiate tolerance.
Reduced population densities lead to increased rates of fissioning in planarians whereas higher population densities suppress fissioning. This effect is not primarily due to mucus deposition or substances secreted into the water. Experiments are presented which show a system of population feedback control. In the presence of other planarians, the brain exerts an influence (probably neurohormonal) to suppress fissioning. This influence becomes attenuated with axial distance from the brain.
Smad2 and Smad4 are related tumour-suppressor proteins, which, when stimulated by the growth factor TGF-beta, form a complex to inhibit growth. The effector function of Smad2 and Smad4 is located in the conserved carboxy-terminal domain (C domain) of these proteins and is inhibited by the presence of their amino-terminal domains (N domain). This inhibitory function of the N domain is shown here to involve an interaction with the C domain that prevents the association of Smad2 with Smad4. This inhibitory function is increased in tumour-derived forms of Smad2 and 4 that carry a missense mutation in a conserved N domain arginine residue. The mutant N domains have an increased affinity for their respective C domains, inhibit the Smad2-Smad4 interaction, and prevent TGF beta-induced Smad2-Smad4 association and signalling. Whereas mutations in the C domain disrupt the effector function of the Smad proteins, N-domain arginine mutations inhibit SMAD signalling through a gain of autoinhibitory function. Gain of autoinhibitory function is a new mechanism for inactivating tumour suppressors.
Natural killer (NK) cells are classically viewed as lymphocytes that provide innate surveillance against virally infected cells and tumour cells through the release of cytolytic mediators and interferon (IFN)-gamma. In humans, blood CD56(dim) NK cells specialize in the lysis of cell targets. In the lymph nodes, CD56(bright) NK cells secrete IFN-gamma cooperating with dendritic cells and T cells in the generation of adaptive responses. Here we report the characterization of a human NK cell subset located in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, such as tonsils and Peyer's patches, which is hard-wired to secrete interleukin (IL)-22, IL-26 and leukaemia inhibitory factor. These NK cells, which we refer to as NK-22 cells, are triggered by acute exposure to IL-23. In vitro, NK-22-secreted cytokines stimulate epithelial cells to secrete IL-10, proliferate and express a variety of mitogenic and anti-apoptotic molecules. NK-22 cells are also found in mouse mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and appear in the small intestine lamina propria during bacterial infection, suggesting that NK-22 cells provide an innate source of IL-22 that may help constrain inflammation and protect mucosal sites.
The cyclic nucleotides cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP are important intracellular messengers mediating the responses to neurotransmitters and neurohormones and regulating cellular function over a wide range of time scales. Despite the widespread acceptance of this second messenger mechanism in many systems, much remains unknown about their mechanism of action, except that such events are associated with increases or decreases in intracellular cyclic nucleotides. Quantitative descriptions of cyclic nucleotide-dependent processes are hampered by the absence of a means by which intracellular cyclic nucleotide concentrations can be accurately controlled. We have now designed, synthesized and characterized new, substituted photolabile cyclic nucleotide analogues, the 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl esters of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP (Fig. 1), which are physiologically inert before irradiation and which liberate free cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP on absorption of a photon. The thermal properties and photolysis rates and efficiencies of light-induced release of cyclic nucleotides from these analogues are more favourable than for the simple o-nitrobenzyl derivatives used previously. These molecules should permit intracellular "concentration jumps' of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP to be produced in cells under physiological investigation with spatial and temporal resolution unmatched by conventional techniques.
The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a sialoglycoprotein of M(r) 33-35K that is expressed predominantly in neurons. In transmissible and genetic neurodegenerative disorders such as scrapie of sheep, spongiform encephalopathy of cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob or Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker diseases of humans, PrPC is converted into an altered form (termed PrPSc) which is distinguishable from its normal homologue by its relative resistance to protease digestion. PrPSc accumulates in the central nervous system of affected individuals, and its protease-resistant core aggregates extracellularly into amyloid fibrils. The process is accompanied by nerve cell loss, whose pathogenesis and molecular basis are not understood. We report here that neuronal death results from chronic exposure of primary rat hippocampal cultures to micromolar concentrations of a peptide corresponding to residues 106-126 of the amino-acid sequence deduced from human PrP complementary DNA. DNA fragmentation of degenerating neurons indicates that cell death occurred by apoptosis. The PrP peptide 106-126 has a high intrinsic ability to polymerize into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. These findings indicate that cerebral accumulation of PrPSc and its degradation products may play a role in the nerve cell degeneration that occurs in prion-related encephalopathies.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disorder affecting about 1 in 2,000 Caucasians. The major cause of morbidity is permanent lung damage resulting from ion transport abnormalities in airway epithelia that lead to mucus accumulation and bacterial colonization. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that encodes a cyclic-AMP-regulated chloride channel. Cyclic-AMP-regulated chloride conductances are altered in airway epithelia from CF patients, suggesting that the functional expression of CFTR in the airways of CF patients may be a strategy for treatment. Transgenic mice with a disrupted cftr gene are appropriate for testing gene therapy protocols. Here we report the use of liposomes to deliver a CFTR expression plasmid to epithelia of the airway and to alveoli deep in the lung, leading to the correction of the ion conductance defects found in the trachea of transgenic (cf/cf) mice. These studies illustrate the feasibility of gene therapy for the pulmonary aspects of CF in humans.
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is coupled to neuronal activity and is imaged in vivo to map brain activation. CBF is also modified by afferent projection fibres that release vasoactive neurotransmitters in the perivascular region, principally on the astrocyte endfeet that outline cerebral blood vessels. However, the role of astrocytes in the regulation of cerebrovascular tone remains uncertain. Here we determine the impact of intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in astrocytes on the diameter of small arterioles by using two-photon Ca(2+) uncaging to increase [Ca(2+)](i). Vascular constrictions occurred when Ca(2+) waves evoked by uncaging propagated into the astrocyte endfeet and caused large increases in [Ca(2+)](i). The vasoactive neurotransmitter noradrenaline increased [Ca(2+)](i) in the astrocyte endfeet, the peak of which preceded the onset of arteriole constriction. Depressing increases in astrocyte [Ca(2+)](i) with BAPTA inhibited the vascular constrictions in noradrenaline. We find that constrictions induced in the cerebrovasculature by increased [Ca(2+)](i) in astrocyte endfeet are generated through the phospholipase A(2)-arachidonic acid pathway and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production. Vasoconstriction by astrocytes is a previously unknown mechanism for the regulation of CBF.
The entorhinal cortex provides the major cortical input to the hippocampus, and both structures have been implicated in memory processes. The dynamics of neuronal circuits in the entorhinal-hippocampal system were studied in slices by optical imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution. Reverberation of neural activity was detected in the entorhinal cortex and was more prominent when the inhibition due to gamma-aminobutyric acid was slightly suppressed. Neural activity was transferred in a frequency-dependent way from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus. The entorhinal neuronal circuit could contribute to memory processes by holding information and selectively gating the entry of information into the hippocampus.
During infection, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) takes over the actin cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells by injecting the EspF(U) protein into the host cytoplasm. EspF(U) controls actin by activating members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family. Here we show that EspF(U) binds to the autoinhibitory GTPase binding domain (GBD) in WASP proteins and displaces it from the activity-bearing VCA domain (for verprolin homology, central hydrophobic and acidic regions). This interaction potently activates WASP and neural (N)-WASP in vitro and induces localized actin assembly in cells. In the solution structure of the GBD-EspF(U) complex, EspF(U) forms an amphipathic helix that binds the GBD, mimicking interactions of the VCA domain in autoinhibited WASP. Thus, EspF(U) activates WASP by competing directly for the VCA binding site on the GBD. This mechanism is distinct from that used by the eukaryotic activators Cdc42 and SH2 domains, which globally destabilize the GBD fold to release the VCA. Such diversity of mechanism in WASP proteins is distinct from other multimodular systems, and may result from the intrinsically unstructured nature of the isolated GBD and VCA elements. The structural incompatibility of the GBD complexes with EspF(U) and Cdc42/SH2, plus high-affinity EspF(U) binding, enable EHEC to hijack the eukaryotic cytoskeletal machinery effectively.
AtT-20 cells, a mouse pituitary line, externalize a viral membrane glycoprotein and the precursor of ACTH constitutively, that is, rapidly without storage or regulation. They also have a regulated pathway in which they cleave the precursor to mature hormones, ACTH and beta-endorphin, store them in secretory granules and discharge them only in the presence of a secretagogue. An analogy exists for newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes which are either delivered to the lysosome or secreted from the cell. Targeting to the lysosomes may require a low pH step, since chloroquine causes the enzymes to be secreted from the cell. Here we show that chloroquine (200 microM) also appears to block the storage of newly synthesized ACTH in secretory granules and instead diverts it to the outside of the cell via the constitutive pathway. Chloroquine has no effect on the constitutive pathway and does not block the exocytosis of pre-packaged ACTH. Thus like lysosomal enzymes, peptide hormones are not sent to their correct destinations in the presence of chloroquine, but are diverted instead to a constitutive pathway that is chloroquine-insensitive.
The p27 mammalian cell cycle protein is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Both in vivo and in vitro, p27 was found to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc2 and Ubc3 were specifically involved in the ubiquitination of p27. Compared with proliferating cells, quiescent cells exhibited a smaller amount of p27 ubiquitinating activity, which accounted for the marked increase of p27 half-life measured in these cells. Thus, the abundance of p27 in cells is regulated by degradation. The specific proteolysis of p27 may represent a mechanism for regulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases.
Calcium influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels is the normal physiological stimulus for the activity-dependent release of neurotransmitters at synaptic contacts. It has been postulated that presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release is due to a reduction in Ca2+ influx at the nerve terminal, which could result from the direct inhibition of Ca2+ channels. Neuropeptide Y and noradrenaline act as cotransmitters at many sympathetic synapses. Both of these substances produce presynaptic inhibition and can inhibit Ca2+ currents in the soma of sympathetic neurons. Here we provide direct evidence that presynaptic inhibition produced by neuropeptide Y at sympathetic nerve terminals is associated with a reduction in Ca2+ influx and that this is due to the selective inhibition of neuronal N-type Ca2+ channels.
The striatum is a major forebrain nucleus that integrates cortical and thalamic afferents and forms the input nucleus of the basal ganglia. Striatal projection neurons target the substantia nigra pars reticulata (direct pathway) or the lateral globus pallidus (indirect pathway). Imbalances between neural activity in these two pathways have been proposed to underlie the profound motor deficits observed in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. However, little is known about differences in cellular and synaptic properties in these circuits. Indeed, current hypotheses suggest that these cells express similar forms of synaptic plasticity. Here we show that excitatory synapses onto indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs) exhibit higher release probability and larger N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor currents than direct-pathway synapses. Moreover, indirect-pathway MSNs selectively express endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD), which requires dopamine D2 receptor activation. In models of Parkinson's disease, indirect-pathway eCB-LTD is absent but is rescued by a D2 receptor agonist or inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation. Administration of these drugs together in vivo reduces parkinsonian motor deficits, suggesting that endocannabinoid-mediated depression of indirect-pathway synapses has a critical role in the control of movement. These findings have implications for understanding the normal functions of the basal ganglia, and also suggest approaches for the development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of striatal-based brain disorders.
Neuroleukin is a neurotrophic factor of relative molecular mass (Mr) 56,000 (56K) found in skeletal muscle, brain, heart and kidneys which supports the survival of embryonic spinal neurones, skeletal motor neurones and sensory neurones. Neuroleukin is also a lymphokine product of lectin-stimulated T cells and induces immunoglobulin secretion by cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Mouse neuroleukin has been cloned, the complete nucleotide sequence has been determined and its complementary DNA has been transiently expressed in monkey COS-1 cells. The serum-free supernatant of the transfected, but not of control mock-transfected, cells was shown to mimic the properties of neuroleukin isolated from mouse salivary glands. In our work on the molecular genetics of carbohydrate metabolism we have recently isolated a mouse glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (or phosphoglucose isomerase, PGI) cDNA clone using the yeast PGI gene (PGI 1) as a probe. We report here that there is complete sequence identity between the 759 nucleotides at the 3' end of this clone (coding and non-coding) and the sequence of mouse neuroleukin.
Understanding how neural activity in sensory cortices relates to perception is a central theme of neuroscience. Action potentials of sensory cortical neurons can be strongly correlated to properties of sensory stimuli and reflect the subjective judgements of an individual about stimuli. Microstimulation experiments have established a direct link from sensory activity to behaviour, suggesting that small neuronal populations can influence sensory decisions. However, microstimulation does not allow identification and quantification of the stimulated cellular elements. The sensory impact of individual cortical neurons therefore remains unknown. Here we show that stimulation of single neurons in somatosensory cortex affects behavioural responses in a detection task. We trained rats to respond to microstimulation of barrel cortex at low current intensities. We then initiated short trains of action potentials in single neurons by juxtacellular stimulation. Animals responded significantly more often in single-cell stimulation trials than in catch trials without stimulation. Stimulation effects varied greatly between cells, and on average in 5% of trials a response was induced. Whereas stimulation of putative excitatory neurons led to weak biases towards responding, stimulation of putative inhibitory neurons led to more variable and stronger sensory effects. Reaction times for single-cell stimulation were long and variable. Our results demonstrate that single neuron activity can cause a change in the animal's detection behaviour, suggesting a much sparser cortical code for sensations than previously anticipated.
Although the single-polypeptide-chain RNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7 (T7RNAP), like other RNA polymerases, uses the same mechanism of polymerization as the DNA polymerases, it can also recognize a specific promoter sequence, initiate new RNA chains from a single nucleotide, abortively cycle the synthesis of short transcripts, be regulated by a transcription inhibitor, and terminate transcription. As T7RNAP is homologous to the Pol I family of DNA polymerases, the differences between the structure of T7RNAP complexed to substrates and that of the corresponding DNA polymerase complex provides a structural basis for understanding many of these functional differences. T7RNAP initiates RNA synthesis at promoter sequences that are conserved from positions -17 to +6 relative to the start site of transcription. The crystal structure at 2.4 A resolution of T7RNAP complexed with a 17-base-pair promoter shows that the four base pairs closest to the catalytic active site have melted to form a transcription bubble. The T7 promoter sequence is recognized by interactions in the major groove between an antiparallel beta-loop and bases. The amino-terminal domain is involved in promoter recognition and DNA melting. We have also used homology modelling of the priming and incoming nucleoside triphosphates from the T7 DNA-polymerase ternary complex structure to explain the specificity of T7RNAP for ribonucleotides, its ability to initiate from a single nucleotide, and the abortive cycling at the initiation of transcription.
The N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor (NMDAR) serves critical functions in physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system, including neuronal development, plasticity and neurodegeneration. Conventional heteromeric NMDARs composed of NR1 and NR2A-D subunits require dual agonists, glutamate and glycine, for activation. They are also highly permeable to Ca2+, and exhibit voltage-dependent inhibition by Mg2+. Coexpression of NR3A with NR1 and NR2 subunits modulates NMDAR activity. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the final member of the NMDAR family, NR3B, which shares high sequence homology with NR3A. From in situ and immunocytochemical analyses, NR3B is expressed predominantly in motor neurons, whereas NR3A is more widely distributed. Remarkably, when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, NR3A or NR3B co-assembles with NR1 to form excitatory glycine receptors that are unaffected by glutamate or NMDA, and inhibited by D-serine, a co-activator of conventional NMDARs. Moreover, NR1/NR3A or -3B receptors form relatively Ca2+-impermeable cation channels that are resistant to Mg2+, MK-801, memantine and competitive antagonists. In cerebrocortical neurons containing NR3 family members, glycine triggers a burst of firing, and membrane patches manifest glycine-responsive single channels that are suppressible by D-serine. By itself, glycine is normally thought of as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. In contrast, these NR1/NR3A or -3B 'NMDARs' constitute a type of excitatory glycine receptor.
The action of penicillin on synaptically evoked dendritic activity was examined with the use of hippocampal slice preparations. Orthodormic activation of CA1 pyramidal neurons produced an excitatory-inhibitory postsynaptic potential sequence recorded intracellularly in the dendrites. Treatment with penicillin resulted in the appearance of spontaneous and synaptically evoked multipeaked field potentials and associated depolarization shifts and spike burst generation in CA1 cells. Intracellular recordings revealed that penicillin produced no detectable change in passive membrane properties of the postsynaptic dendrites. However, the inhibitory postsynaptic potential was suppressed by penicillin, resulting in the release of intrinsic dendritic burst firing during synaptic activation. These findings emphasize the role of normal patterns of dendritic burst generation in the production of intense neuronal discharge during penicillin-induced epileptiform activities.
Oscillatory firing patterns are an intrinsic property of some neurons and have an important function in information processing. In some cells, low voltage-activated calcium channels have been proposed to underlie a depolarizing potential that regulates bursting. The sequence of a rat brain calcium channel alpha 1 subunit (rbE-II) was deduced. Although it is structurally related to high voltage-activated calcium channels, the rbE-II channel transiently activated at negative membrane potentials, required a strong hyperpolarization to deinactivate, and was highly sensitive to block by nickel. In situ hybridization showed that rbE-II messenger RNA is expressed in regions throughout the central nervous system. The electrophysiological properties of the rbE-II current are consistent with a type of low voltage-activated calcium channel that requires membrane hyperpolarization for maximal activity, which suggests that rbE-II may be involved in the modulation of firing patterns.
The gene encoding inhibitor of kappa B (IkappaB) kinase alpha (IKKalpha; also called IKK1) was disrupted by gene targeting. IKKalpha-deficient mice died perinatally. In IKKalpha-deficient fetuses, limb outgrowth was severely impaired despite unaffected skeletal development. The epidermal cells in IKKalpha-deficient fetuses were highly proliferative with dysregulated epidermal differentiation. In the basal layer, degradation of IkappaB and nuclear localization of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) were not observed. Thus, IKKalpha is essential for NF-kappaB activation in the limb and skin during embryogenesis. In contrast, there was no impairment of NF-kappaB activation induced by either interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha in IKKalpha-deficient embryonic fibroblasts and thymocytes, indicating that IKKalpha is not essential for cytokine-induced activation of NF-kappaB.
Catecholaminergic systems in discrete regions of the brain are thought to be important in affective psychoses, learning and memory, reinforcement and sleep-wake cycle regulation. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the first enzyme in the pathway of catecholamine synthesis. Its importance is reflected in the diversity of the mechanisms that have been described which control its activity; TH levels vary both during development and as a function of the activity of the nervous system. Recently, we deduced the complete amino-acid sequence of rat TH from a complementary DNA clone encoding a functional enzyme. Here we demonstrate that, in man, TH molecules are encoded by at least three distinct messenger RNAs. The expression of these mRNAs varies in different parts of the nervous system. The sequence differences observed are confined to the 5' termini of the messengers and involve alternative splicing events. This variation has clear functional consequences for each putative form of the enzyme and could represent a novel means of regulating catecholamine levels in normal and pathological neurons.
"Movement-detecting" units that respond little or not at all to illumination without movement, respond to change in position under stroboscopic light even when relatively large jumps in the visual field occur during a dark pause between two flashes. The threshold angle and angular velocity are different for different classes of units. They are higher for the periphery of the receptive field and increase with decreasing contrast. An inhibitory effect of a large surrounding of the receptive field coluld be demonstrated in class-2 neurvons.
Follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are the two most common non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Here we sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from 13 DLBCL cases and one FL case to identify genes with mutations in B-cell NHL. We analysed RNA-seq data from these and another 113 NHLs to identify genes with candidate mutations, and then re-sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from these cases to confirm 109 genes with multiple somatic mutations. Genes with roles in histone modification were frequent targets of somatic mutation. For example, 32% of DLBCL and 89% of FL cases had somatic mutations in MLL2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase, and 11.4% and 13.4% of DLBCL and FL cases, respectively, had mutations in MEF2B, a calcium-regulated gene that cooperates with CREBBP and EP300 in acetylating histones. Our analysis suggests a previously unappreciated disruption of chromatin biology in lymphomagenesis.
Intracaudate injections of kainic acid destroy striatal neurons containing acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid but leave dopaminergic nerve terminals in this brain region intact. Rats injected with the drug are aphagic and adipsic, and have other behavioral abnormalities strikingly similar to those seen in animals with lesions in the dopaminergic nigrostriatal bundle.
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) affects 33 million individuals worldwide and is a leading cause of blindness. In a study of 54 families with autosomal dominantly inherited adult-onset POAG, we identified the causative gene on chromosome 10p14 and designated it OPTN (for "optineurin"). Sequence alterations in OPTN were found in 16.7% of families with hereditary POAG, including individuals with normal intraocular pressure. The OPTN gene codes for a conserved 66-kilodalton protein of unknown function that has been implicated in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling pathway and that interacts with diverse proteins including Huntingtin, Ras-associated protein RAB8, and transcription factor IIIA. Optineurin is expressed in trabecular meshwork, nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, retina, and brain, and we speculate that it plays a neuroprotective role.
GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid(A)) receptors are molecular substrates for the regulation of vigilance, anxiety, muscle tension, epileptogenic activity and memory functions, which is evident from the spectrum of actions elicited by clinically effective drugs acting at their modulatory benzodiazepine-binding site. Here we show, by introducing a histidine-to-arginine point mutation at position 101 of the murine alpha1-subunit gene, that alpha1-type GABA(A) receptors, which are mainly expressed in cortical areas and thalamus, are rendered insensitive to allosteric modulation by benzodiazepine-site ligands, whilst regulation by the physiological neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid is preserved. alpha1(H101R) mice failed to show the sedative, amnesic and partly the anticonvulsant action of diazepam. In contrast, the anxiolytic-like, myorelaxant, motor-impairing and ethanol-potentiating effects were fully retained, and are attributed to the nonmutated GABA(A) receptors found in the limbic system (alpha2, alpha5), in monoaminergic neurons (alpha3) and in motoneurons (alpha2, alpha5). Thus, benzodiazepine-induced behavioural responses are mediated by specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes in distinct neuronal circuits, which is of interest for drug design.
Sensory information reaches the cerebral cortex through the thalamus, which differentially relays this input depending on the state of arousal. Such 'gating' involves inhibition of the thalamocortical relay neurons by the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We reconstructed the thalamocortical circuit as an artificial and biological hybrid network in vitro. With visual input simulated as retinal cell activity, we show here that when the gain in the thalamic inhibitory feedback loop is greater than a critical value, the circuit tends towards oscillations -- and thus imposes a temporal decorrelation of retinal cell input and thalamic relay output. This results in the functional disconnection of the cortex from the sensory drive, a feature typical of sleep states. Conversely, low gain in the feedback inhibition and the action of noradrenaline, a known modulator of arousal, converge to increase input output correlation in relay neurons. Combining gain control of feedback inhibition and modulation of membrane excitability thus enables thalamic circuits to finely tune the gating of spike transmission from sensory organs to the cortex.
Several aspects of cortical organization are thought to remain plastic into adulthood, allowing cortical sensorimotor maps to be modified continuously by experience. This dynamic nature of cortical circuitry is important for learning, as well as for repair after injury to the nervous system. Electrophysiology studies suggest that adult macaque primary visual cortex (V1) undergoes large-scale reorganization within a few months after retinal lesioning, but this issue has not been conclusively settled. Here we applied the technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect changes in the cortical topography of macaque area V1 after binocular retinal lesions. fMRI allows non-invasive, in vivo, long-term monitoring of cortical activity with a wide field of view, sampling signals from multiple neurons per unit cortical area. We show that, in contrast with previous studies, adult macaque V1 does not approach normal responsivity during 7.5 months of follow-up after retinal lesions, and its topography does not change. Electrophysiology experiments corroborated the fMRI results. This indicates that adult macaque V1 has limited potential for reorganization in the months following retinal injury.
Diets rich in fish and fish oils are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. The interaction of a commercial fish oil extract (MaxEPA) with vascular endothelial cells (ECs) was studied as a possible mechanism for this protective effect. MaxEPA almost completely inhibited EC production of platelet-derived growth factor-like protein (PDGFc) while other lipids had a lesser effect or no effect. Overall protein synthesis was not reduced, nor was the inhibition due to defective secretion or increased degradation of the growth factor. Antioxidants suppressed the inhibitory activity of MaxEPA indicating that free radical oxidative processes were required for the inhibition. These results suggest that fish oils may suppress intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation by decreasing the production of EC-derived paracrine growth factors. This inhibitory process represents a possible molecular mechanism for the antiatherosclerotic action of marine lipids.
Renin is an aspartyl proteinase that catalyses the first, and rate-limiting, step in the conversion of angiotensinogen to the hormone angiotensin II. The catalysis is highly specific, and plays an important physiological part in the regulation of blood pressure. For this reason inhibitors of renin are of potential value in the treatment of certain forms of hypertension. Although progress has been made in the design of inhibitors for clinical use by modification of angiotensinogen sequences, and as pepstatin analogues or with reduced peptide bonds, we have now provided the basis for a more rational approach by the use of interactive computer graphics techniques to build a three-dimensional model of renin. The model is based on the three-dimensional structure of endothia pepsin and the primary structure of mouse renin, which is very similar to that of the human enzyme. We show that renin may have a three-dimensional structure similar to that of other aspartyl proteinases.
An inflammatory response initiated by the NLRP3 inflammasome is triggered by a variety of situations of host 'danger', including infection and metabolic dysregulation. Previous studies suggested that NLRP3 inflammasome activity is negatively regulated by autophagy and positively regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from an uncharacterized organelle. Here we show that mitophagy/autophagy blockade leads to the accumulation of damaged, ROS-generating mitochondria, and this in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Resting NLRP3 localizes to endoplasmic reticulum structures, whereas on inflammasome activation both NLRP3 and its adaptor ASC redistribute to the perinuclear space where they co-localize with endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria organelle clusters. Notably, both ROS generation and inflammasome activation are suppressed when mitochondrial activity is dysregulated by inhibition of the voltage-dependent anion channel. This indicates that NLRP3 inflammasome senses mitochondrial dysfunction and may explain the frequent association of mitochondrial damage with inflammatory diseases.
In rats placed in continuous darkness for 6 days, there is a striking increase in the activity of melatonin-synthesizing-enzyme (hydroxyindole-0-methyl transferase) in the pineal gland, but no change in the activity of monoamine oxidase. Since melatonin appears to have a hormonal role in mammals, and its synthesis is confined to the pineal gland, the inhibition of hydroxyindole-O-methyl transferase by light may constitute a mechanism of neuroendocrine regulation.
A radioiodinated ligand that binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors was shown to distribute in the brain by a receptor-mediated process. With single-photon-emission imaging techniques, radioactivity was detected in the cerebrum but not in the cerebellum, whereas with a flow-limited radiotracer, radioactivity was detected in cerebrum and cerebellum. Single-photon-emission computed tomography showed good definition of the caudate putamen and cortex in man.
In the cerebral cortex, local circuits consist of tens of thousands of neurons, each of which makes thousands of synaptic connections. Perhaps the biggest impediment to understanding these networks is that we have no wiring diagrams of their interconnections. Even if we had a partial or complete wiring diagram, however, understanding the network would also require information about each neuron's function. Here we show that the relationship between structure and function can be studied in the cortex with a combination of in vivo physiology and network anatomy. We used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize a functional property--the preferred stimulus orientation--of a group of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. Large-scale electron microscopy of serial thin sections was then used to trace a portion of these neurons' local network. Consistent with a prediction from recent physiological experiments, inhibitory interneurons received convergent anatomical input from nearby excitatory neurons with a broad range of preferred orientations, although weak biases could not be rejected.
Interferon-gamma-inducing factor (IGIF, interleukin-18) is a recently described cytokine that shares structural features with the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of proteins and functional properties with IL-12. Like IL-12, IGIF is a potent inducer of interferon (IFN)-gamma from T cells and natural killer cells. IGIF is synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor molecule (proIGIF). The cellular production of IL-1beta, a cytokine implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases, requires cleavage of its precursor (proIL-1beta) at an Asp-X site by interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE, recently termed caspase-1). The Asp-X sequence at the putative processing site in proIGIF suggests that a protease such as caspase-1 might be involved in the maturation of IGIF. Here we demonstrate that caspase-1 processes proIGIF and proIL-1beta with equivalent efficiencies in vitro. A selective caspase-1 inhibitor blocks both lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1beta and IFN-gamma production from human mononuclear cells. Furthermore, caspase-1-deficient mice are defective in lipopolysaccharide-induced IFN-gamma production. Our results thus implicate caspase-1 in the physiological production of IGIF and demonstrate that it plays a critical role in the regulation of multiple proinflammatory cytokines. Specific caspase-1 inhibitors would provide a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs with multipotent action.
Noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus involved in feeding and satiety are activated by gastrointestinal receptors. In the unrestrained rat, sites were first identified at which norepinephrine injected in the medial hypothalamus caused spontaneous feeding, or in the lateral hypothalamus caused no response. The activity of in vivo norepinephrine at these two sites was characterized by localized push-pull perfusion. When a nutrient was infused directly into the rat's duodenum, the synaptic release of hypothalamic norepinephrine was enhanced at lateral sites insensitive to norepinephrine, but suppressed at medial sites reactive to norepinephrine. Thus, signals from duodenal receptors are conceivably sent to the rat's brain to end feeding by way of noradrenergic inhibitory neurons in the hypothalamus.
We have shown that a polypeptide of M(r) 60,000 (60K) that shares N-terminal homology with a calcium-binding protein, calreticulin, can bind to an amino-acid sequence motif, KXGFFKR, found in the cytoplasmic domains of all integrin alpha-subunits. The homologous amino-acid sequence, KXFFKR (where X is either G, A or V), is also present in the DNA-binding domain of all known members of the steroid hormone receptor family; amino acids in this sequence make direct contact with nucleotides in their DNA-responsive elements and are crucial for DNA binding. Here we show that both the 60K protein (p60), purified on a KLGFFKR-Sepharose affinity matrix, and recombinant calreticulin can inhibit the binding of androgen receptor to its hormone-responsive DNA element in a KXFFKR-sequence-specific manner. Calreticulin can also inhibit androgen receptor and retinoic acid receptor transcriptional activities in vivo, as well as retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Our results indicate that calreticulin can act as an important modulator of the regulation of gene transcription by nuclear hormone receptors.
Single unit activity was recorded from the frontal eye fields (area 8) in unanesthetized monkeys seated in a primate chair with the head restrained. The frontal eye field units were identified by antidromic response to stimulation of the cerebral peduncle. The findings indicate that most of the neurons discharge only after initiation of eye movements. These cells showed steady discharge when the eyes were immobile and oriented in a specific direction.
The central nervous system has extraordinary plasticity in early life. This is thought to involve N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors which, along with the non-NMDA receptors, mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Although NMDA receptors may be transiently enhanced early in life, it has not been possible to demonstrate directly a functional change in the NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic response because of the voltage-dependence of the NMDA conductance and the overlapping inhibitory synaptic conductances. Here I report that the duration of evoked NMDA-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (e.p.s.cs) in the superior colliculus is several times longer at early developmental stages compared to that measured in older animals. In contrast, the amplitude of NMDA-receptor-mediated miniature e.p.s.cs does not change during development. The kinetic response of excised membrane patches to a brief activation of NMDA receptors is similar to that of the NMDA e.p.s.c, which suggests that the time course of the NMDA e.p.s.c. in the superior colliculus reflects slow NMDA channel properties as in the hippocampus. Therefore, these data indicate that the molecular properties of NMDA receptors are developmentally regulated and thus may be controlling the ability of synapses to change in early life.
The hypothesis that cyclic nucleotides are intracellular second messengers mediating the generation of synaptic potentials was studied in the sympathetic ganglia of the bullfrog. Synaptic potentials and the effect of administering cyclic nucleotides and agents which affect cyclic nucleotide metabolism were recorded by the sucrose gap technique. The administration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP), or several of their derivatives produced little or no change in membrane potential. Prostaglandin E1 did not block the generation of postsynaptic potentials. Theophylline produced membrane effects that were different from those associated with postsynaptic potential generation; it also reduced the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and potentiated the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). The administration of papaverine, however, reduced both the slow EPSP and the slow IPSP. Although synaptic stimulation increases both cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP in these neurons, these results raise the possibility that these cyclic nucleotides may have functionla roles other than mediation of synaptic potentials.
Lurcher (Lc) is a spontaneous, semidominant mouse neurological mutation. Heterozygous Lurcher mice (Lc/+) display ataxia as a result of a selective, cell-autonomous and apoptotic death of cerebellar Purkinje cells during postnatal development. Homozygous Lurcher mice (Lc/Lc) die shortly after birth because of a massive loss of mid- and hindbrain neurons during late embryogenesis. We have used positional cloning to identify the mutations responsible for neurodegeneration in two independent Lc alleles as G-to-A transitions that change a highly conserved alanine to a threonine residue in transmembrane domain III of the mouse delta2 glutamate receptor gene (GluR delta2). Lc/+ Purkinje cells have a very high membrane conductance and a depolarized resting potential, indicating the presence of a large, constitutive inward current. Expression of the mutant GluR delta2(Lc) protein in Xenopus oocytes confirmed these results, demonstrating that Lc is inherited as a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from a gain-of-function mutation in a glutamate receptor gene. Thus the activation of apoptotic neuronal death in Lurcher mice may provide a physiologically relevant model for excitotoxic cell death.
The subventricular zone of many adult non-human mammals generates large numbers of new neurons destined for the olfactory bulb. Along the walls of the lateral ventricles, immature neuronal progeny migrate in tangentially oriented chains that coalesce into a rostral migratory stream (RMS) connecting the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb. The adult human subventricular zone, in contrast, contains a hypocellular gap layer separating the ependymal lining from a periventricular ribbon of astrocytes. Some of these subventricular zone astrocytes can function as neural stem cells in vitro, but their function in vivo remains controversial. An initial report found few subventricular zone proliferating cells and rare migrating immature neurons in the RMS of adult humans. In contrast, a subsequent study indicated robust proliferation and migration in the human subventricular zone and RMS. Here we find that the infant human subventricular zone and RMS contain an extensive corridor of migrating immature neurons before 18 months of age but, contrary to previous reports, this germinal activity subsides in older children and is nearly extinct by adulthood. Surprisingly, during this limited window of neurogenesis, not all new neurons in the human subventricular zone are destined for the olfactory bulb--we describe a major migratory pathway that targets the prefrontal cortex in humans. Together, these findings reveal robust streams of tangentially migrating immature neurons in human early postnatal subventricular zone and cortex. These pathways represent potential targets of neurological injuries affecting neonates.
Neuromotor prostheses (NMPs) aim to replace or restore lost motor functions in paralysed humans by routeing movement-related signals from the brain, around damaged parts of the nervous system, to external effectors. To translate preclinical results from intact animals to a clinically useful NMP, movement signals must persist in cortex after spinal cord injury and be engaged by movement intent when sensory inputs and limb movement are long absent. Furthermore, NMPs would require that intention-driven neuronal activity be converted into a control signal that enables useful tasks. Here we show initial results for a tetraplegic human (MN) using a pilot NMP. Neuronal ensemble activity recorded through a 96-microelectrode array implanted in primary motor cortex demonstrated that intended hand motion modulates cortical spiking patterns three years after spinal cord injury. Decoders were created, providing a 'neural cursor' with which MN opened simulated e-mail and operated devices such as a television, even while conversing. Furthermore, MN used neural control to open and close a prosthetic hand, and perform rudimentary actions with a multi-jointed robotic arm. These early results suggest that NMPs based upon intracortical neuronal ensemble spiking activity could provide a valuable new neurotechnology to restore independence for humans with paralysis.
Chromatin modifications, especially histone-tail acetylation, have been implicated in memory formation. Increased histone-tail acetylation induced by inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACis) facilitates learning and memory in wild-type mice as well as in mouse models of neurodegeneration. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of HDACis requires knowledge of the specific HDAC family member(s) linked to cognitive enhancement. Here we show that neuron-specific overexpression of HDAC2, but not that of HDAC1, decreased dendritic spine density, synapse number, synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Conversely, Hdac2 deficiency resulted in increased synapse number and memory facilitation, similar to chronic treatment with HDACis in mice. Notably, reduced synapse number and learning impairment of HDAC2-overexpressing mice were ameliorated by chronic treatment with HDACis. Correspondingly, treatment with HDACis failed to further facilitate memory formation in Hdac2-deficient mice. Furthermore, analysis of promoter occupancy revealed an association of HDAC2 with the promoters of genes implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Taken together, our results suggest that HDAC2 functions in modulating synaptic plasticity and long-lasting changes of neural circuits, which in turn negatively regulates learning and memory. These observations encourage the development and testing of HDAC2-selective inhibitors for human diseases associated with memory impairment.
Our two eyes obtain slightly different views of the world. The resulting differences in the two retinal images, called binocular disparities, provide us with a stereoscopic sense of depth. The primary visual cortex (V1) contains neurons that are selective for the disparity of individual elements in an image, but this information must be further analysed to complete the stereoscopic process. Here we apply the psychophysical technique of reverse correlation to investigate disparity processing in human vision. Observers viewed binocular random-dot patterns, with 'signal' dots in a specific depth plane plus 'noise' dots with randomly assigned disparities. By examining the correlation between the observers' ability to detect the plane and the particular sample of 'noise' disparities presented on each trial, we revealed detection 'filters', whose disparity selectivity was remarkably similar to that of individual neurons in monkey V1. Moreover, if the noise dots were of opposite contrast in the two eyes, the tuning inverted, just like the response patterns of V1 neurons. Reverse correlation appears to probe disparity processing at the earliest stages of binocular combination, prior to the generation of a full stereoscopic depth percept.
Bacteria have developed mechanisms to communicate and compete with each other for limited environmental resources. We found that certain Escherichia coli, including uropathogenic strains, contained a bacterial growth-inhibition system that uses direct cell-to-cell contact. Inhibition was conditional, dependent upon the growth state of the inhibitory cell and the pili expression state of the target cell. Both a large cell-surface protein designated Contact-dependent inhibitor A (CdiA) and two-partner secretion family member CdiB were required for growth inhibition. The CdiAB system may function to regulate the growth of specific cells within a differentiated bacterial population.
The onset of puberty defines a developmental stage when some learning processes are diminished, but the mechanism for this deficit remains unknown. We found that, at puberty, expression of inhibitory alpha4betadelta gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors (GABAR) increases perisynaptic to excitatory synapses in CA1 hippocampus. Shunting inhibition via these receptors reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, impairing induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Pubertal mice also failed to learn a hippocampal, LTP-dependent spatial task that was easily acquired by delta-/- mice. However, the stress steroid THP (3alphaOH-5alpha[beta]-pregnan-20-one), which reduces tonic inhibition at puberty, facilitated learning. Thus, the emergence of alpha4betadelta GABARs at puberty impairs learning, an effect that can be reversed by a stress steroid.
Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer that can be inherited, but the genetic aetiology is largely unknown. Here we show that germline mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene explain most hereditary neuroblastomas, and that activating mutations can also be somatically acquired. We first identified a significant linkage signal at chromosome bands 2p23-24 using a whole-genome scan in neuroblastoma pedigrees. Resequencing of regional candidate genes identified three separate germline missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK that segregated with the disease in eight separate families. Resequencing in 194 high-risk neuroblastoma samples showed somatically acquired mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain in 12.4% of samples. Nine of the ten mutations map to critical regions of the kinase domain and were predicted, with high probability, to be oncogenic drivers. Mutations resulted in constitutive phosphorylation, and targeted knockdown of ALK messenger RNA resulted in profound inhibition of growth in all cell lines harbouring mutant or amplified ALK, as well as in two out of six wild-type cell lines for ALK. Our results demonstrate that heritable mutations of ALK are the main cause of familial neuroblastoma, and that germline or acquired activation of this cell-surface kinase is a tractable therapeutic target for this lethal paediatric malignancy.
Projections from medial preoptic area (mPOA) and medial anterior hypothalamic area (mAHA) neurons were investigated in albino rats with the use of tritiated amino acid autoradiography. Both the mPOA and the mAHA gave long-axon projections to structures in limbic forebrain and midbrain as well as short-axon projections to other hypothalamic regions. Differences between mPOA and mAHA neurons were observed in projections to the mid-septal region, ventromedial hypothalamus, premammillary region, and central gray. Further, while axons from the mPOA traveled within the medial forebrain bundle, those from the mAHA remained in a band ventromedial to the fornix. These anatomical differences may underlie functional differences between the mPOA and mAHA which have been demonstrated with other experimental techniques.
Children who are adept at any one of the three academic 'R's (reading, writing and arithmetic) tend to be good at the others, and grow into adults who are similarly skilled at diverse intellectually demanding activities. Determining the neuroanatomical correlates of this relatively stable individual trait of general intelligence has proved difficult, particularly in the rapidly developing brains of children and adolescents. Here we demonstrate that the trajectory of change in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, rather than cortical thickness itself, is most closely related to level of intelligence. Using a longitudinal design, we find a marked developmental shift from a predominantly negative correlation between intelligence and cortical thickness in early childhood to a positive correlation in late childhood and beyond. Additionally, level of intelligence is associated with the trajectory of cortical development, primarily in frontal regions implicated in the maturation of intelligent activity. More intelligent children demonstrate a particularly plastic cortex, with an initial accelerated and prolonged phase of cortical increase, which yields to equally vigorous cortical thinning by early adolescence. This study indicates that the neuroanatomical expression of intelligence in children is dynamic.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder of motor neurons in the cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Its cause is unknown and it is uniformly fatal, typically within five years. About 10% of cases are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with high penetrance after the sixth decade. In most instances, sporadic and autosomal dominant familial ALS (FALS) are clinically similar. We have previously shown that in some but not all FALS pedigrees the disease is linked to a genetic defect on chromosome 21q (refs 8, 9). Here we report tight genetic linkage between FALS and a gene that encodes a cytosolic, Cu/Zn-binding superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a homodimeric metalloenzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the toxic superoxide anion O2.- to O2 and H2O2 (ref. 10). Given this linkage and the potential role of free radical toxicity in other neurodenegerative disorders, we investigated SOD1 as a candidate gene in FALS. We identified 11 different SOD1 missense mutations in 13 different FALS families.
The major postsynaptic density (PSD) protein at glutaminergic synapses is calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-K II), but its function in the PSD is not known. We have examined glutamate receptors (GluRs) as substrates for CaM-K II because (1) they are colocalized in the PSD, (2) cloned GluRs contain consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinases including CaM-K II, and (3) several GluRs are regulated by other protein kinases. Regulation of GluRs, which are involved in excitatory synaptic transmission and in mechanisms of learning and memory, by CaM-K II is of interest because of the postulated role of CaM-K II in synaptic plasticity and its known involvement in induction of long-term potentiation. Furthermore, mice lacking the major neural isoform of CaM-K II exhibit deficits in models of learning and memory that require hippocampal input. We report here that CaM-K II phosphorylates GluR in several in vitro systems, including the PSD, and that activated CaM-K II enhances kainate-induced ion current three- to fourfold in cultured hippocampal neurons. These results are consistent with a role for PSD CaM-K II in strengthening postsynaptic GluR responses in synaptic plasticity.
Theoretical studies suggest that primary visual cortex (area V1) uses a sparse code to efficiently represent natural scenes. This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing.
Although histaminergic neurones have not yet been histochemically visualized, there is little doubt that histamine (HA) has a neurotransmitter role in the invertebrate and mammalian central nervous system. For example, a combination of biochemical, electrophysiological and lesion studies in rats have shown that histamine is synthesized in and released from a discrete set of neurones ascending through the lateral hypothalamic area and widely projecting in the telencephalon. Histamine acts on target cells in mammalian brain via stimulation of two classes of receptor (H1 and H2) previously characterized in peripheral organs and probably uses Ca2+ and cyclic AMP, respectively, as second messengers. It is well established that several neurotransmitters affect neuronal activity in the central nervous system through stimulation not only of postsynaptic receptors, but also of receptors located presynaptically which often display distinct pharmacological specificity and by which they may control their own release. Such 'autoreceptors' have been demonstrated (or postulated) in the case of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurones but have never been demonstrated for histamine. We show here that histamine inhibits its own release from depolarized slices of rat cerebral cortex, an action apparently mediated by a class of receptor (H3) pharmacologically distinct from those previously characterized, that is, the H1 and H2 receptors.
Drosophila show innate olfactory-driven behaviours that are observed in naive animals without previous learning or experience, suggesting that the neural circuits that mediate these behaviours are genetically programmed. Despite the numerical simplicity of the fly nervous system, features of the anatomical organization of the fly brain often confound the delineation of these circuits. Here we identify a neural circuit responsive to cVA, a pheromone that elicits sexually dimorphic behaviours. We have combined neural tracing using an improved photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PA-GFP) with electrophysiology, optical imaging and laser-mediated microlesioning to map this circuit from the activation of sensory neurons in the antennae to the excitation of descending neurons in the ventral nerve cord. This circuit is concise and minimally comprises four neurons, connected by three synapses. Three of these neurons are overtly dimorphic and identify a male-specific neuropil that integrates inputs from multiple sensory systems and sends outputs to the ventral nerve cord. This neural pathway suggests a means by which a single pheromone can elicit different behaviours in the two sexes.
An as-yet unresolved issue in developmental neurobiology is whether the discrete areas that form the mammalian cortex emerge from a uniform cortical plate or whether they are already specified in the germinal zone. A feature of the primate striate cortex is that the number of neurons per unit area is twice that of anywhere else in the cerebral cortex. Here we take advantage of this unique structural feature to investigate whether the extra striate cortical cells are due to increased neuron production during neurogenesis. We labelled precursors undergoing terminal cell division with 3H-thymidine and allowed them to migrate to the cortical plate. Cell counts revealed that their rate of production in the germinal zone of striate cortex is higher than in that given rise to extrastriate cortex. Also, we used 3H-thymidine pulse injections to investigate cell cycle dynamics and found that this phase of increased production of striate cortical cells is associated with changes in the parameters of the cell cycle. These results show that cortical area identity is at least partially determined at the level of the ventricular zone.
The increases in the intracellular concentrations of inorganic phosphate and hydrogen ion accompanying fatigue of skeletal muscle appear to be the most important metabolic changes associated with the decrease in contractile force. Experiments on chemically skinned single fibers from rabbit psoas muscle with pH ranging between 6 and 7.25 demonstrate that the depression of maximal calcium-activated force by inorganic phosphate correlates nicely with the concentration of the acidic (diprotonated) species. Therefore, in addition to the well-known depressant effect on the contractile machinery of lowering pH per se, any decrease of intracellular pH associated with fatigue further depresses force production by converting more of the total inorganic phosphate within the cell to the inhibitory diprotonated form.
It has been suggested that Hox genes play an important part in the patterning of limbs, vertebrae and craniofacial structures by providing an ordered molecular system of positional values, termed the Hox code. Little is known about the nature of the signals that govern the establishment and regulation of Hox genes, but retinoic acid can affect the expression of these genes in cell lines and in embryonic tissues. On the basis of experimental and clinical evidence, the hindbrain and branchial region of the head are particularly sensitive to the effects of retinoic acid but the phenotypes are complex and hard to interpret, and how and if they relate to Hox expression has not been clear. Here we follow the changes induced by retinoic acid to hindbrain segmentation and the branchial arches using transgenic mice which contain lacZ reporter genes that reveal the endogenous segment-restricted expression of the Hox-B1 (Hox-2.9), Hox-B2(Hox-2.8) and Krox-20 genes. Our results show that these genes rapidly respond to exposure to retinoic acid at preheadfold stages and undergo a progressive series of changes in segmental expression that are associated with specific phenotypes in hindbrain of first branchial arch. Together the molecular and anatomical alterations indicate that retinoic acid has induced changes in the hindbrain Hox code which result in the homeotic transformation of rhombomeres (r) 2/3 to an r4/5 identity. A main feature of this rhombomeric phenotype is that the trigeminal motor nerve is transformed to a facial identity. Furthermore, in support of this change in rhombomeric identity, neural crest cells derived from r2/3 also express posterior Hox markers suggesting that the retinoic acid-induced transformation extends to multiple components of the first branchial arch.
Cells with loss of BRCA2 function are defective in homologous recombination (HR) and are highly sensitive to inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which provides the basis for a new therapeutic approach. Here we show that resistance to PARP inhibition can be acquired by deletion of a mutation in BRCA2. We derived PARP-inhibitor-resistant (PIR) clones from the human CAPAN1 pancreatic cancer cell line, which carries the protein-truncating c.6174delT frameshift mutation. PIR clones could form DNA-damage-induced RAD51 nuclear foci and were able to limit genotoxin-induced genomic instability, both hallmarks of a competent HR pathway. New BRCA2 isoforms were expressed in the resistant lines as a result of intragenic deletion of the c.6174delT mutation and restoration of the open reading frame (ORF). Reconstitution of BRCA2-deficient cells with these revertant BRCA2 alleles rescued PARP inhibitor sensitivity and HR deficiency. Most of the deletions in BRCA2 were associated with small tracts of homology, and possibly arose from error-prone repair caused by BRCA2 deficiency. Similar ORF-restoring mutations were present in carboplatin-resistant ovarian tumours from c.6174delT mutation carriers. These observations have implications for understanding drug resistance in BRCA mutation carriers as well as in defining functionally important domains within BRCA2.
Human cerebral cortical function degrades during old age. Much of this change may result from a degradation of intracortical inhibition during senescence. We used multibarreled microelectrodes to study the effects of electrophoretic application of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the GABA type a (GABAa) receptor agonist muscimol, and the GABAa receptor antagonist bicuculline, respectively, on the properties of individual V1 cells in old monkeys. Bicuculline exerted a much weaker effect on neuronal responses in old than in young animals, confirming a degradation of GABA-mediated inhibition. On the other hand, the administration of GABA and muscimol resulted in improved visual function. Many treated cells in area V1 of old animals displayed responses typical of young cells. The present results have important implications for the treatment of the sensory, motor, and cognitive declines that accompany old age.
Previous research has indicated that intracerebral injection of potassium chloride, and the resultant electrical silence of the brain, lead to the attenuation of a previously conditioned emotional response; this response may reflect conditioned fear. The data reported here indicate that the normal mobilization of corticosteroids, perhaps a second index of emotionality, is also attenuated by such injections.
Determination of levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in various brain areas of male Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from four different breeder-suppliers showed considerably different basal levels among the various groups, as well as differences in response to monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
Mammals manifest circadian behaviour timed by an endogenous clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Considerable progress has been made in identifying the molecular basis of the circadian clock, but the mechanisms by which it is translated into cyclic firing activity, high during the day and low at night, are still poorly understood. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), a common inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is particularly densely distributed within the SCN, where it is located in the majority of neuronal somata and synaptic terminals. Using an in vitro brain-slice technique, we have now studied the effect of bath-applied GABA on adult SCN neurons at various times of the day. We find that GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter at night, decreasing the firing frequency; but during the day GABA acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter, increasing the firing frequency. We show that this dual effect, which is mediated by GABA(A) receptors, may be attributed to an oscillation in intracellular chloride concentration. A likely explanation is that the amplitude of the oscillation in firing rate, displayed by individual neurons, is amplified by the dual effect of GABA in the SCN's GABAergic network.
Presence of sodium in the bathing medium is not essential for the electrically excitable depolarizing electrogenesis of crayfish muscle fibers, production of action potentials being dependent on calcium. The depolarizing electrogenesis of the excitatory synaptic membrane component does require sodium, however, and this ion cannot be replaced by lithium as it can in spike electrogenesis of many cells. Ionophoretic applications of glutamate, which in the presence of sodium depolarize the cell by activating the excitatory synaptic membrane, are without effect in the absence of sodium. Not only is there no depolarization, but the membrane conductance also remains unchanged. Thus, in the absence of inward movement of sodium across the synaptic membrane there is also no outward movement of potassium. Accordingly, it seems that increased conductance for potassium is not an independent process in the synaptic membrane, whereas it is independent of sodium activation in spike electrogenesis. Chloride activation is independent, however; increase in conductance and the electrogenesis of the inhibitory synaptic component are not affected by the absence of sodium. Implications of these findings regarding the structure of differently excitable membrane components are discussed.
Establishing precise synaptic connections is crucial to the development of functional neural circuits. The direction-selective circuit in the retina relies upon highly selective wiring of inhibitory inputs from starburst amacrine cells (SACs) onto four subtypes of ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), each preferring motion in one of four cardinal directions. It has been reported in rabbit that the SACs on the 'null' sides of DSGCs form functional GABA (g-aminobutyric acid)-mediated synapses, whereas those on the preferred sides do not. However, it is not known how the asymmetric wiring between SACs and DSGCs is established during development. Here we report that in transgenic mice with cell-type-specific labelling, the synaptic connections from SACs to DSGCs were of equal strength during the first postnatal week, regardless of whether the SAC was located on the preferred or null side of the DSGC. However, by the end of the second postnatal week, the strength of the synapses made from SACs on the null side of a DSGC significantly increased whereas those made from SACs located on the preferred side remained constant. Blocking retinal activity by intraocular injections of muscimol or gabazine during this period did not alter the development of direction selectivity. Hence, the asymmetric inhibition between the SACs and DSGCs is achieved by a developmental program that specifically strengthens the GABA-mediated inputs from SACs located on the null side, in a manner not dependent on neural activity.
Epigenetic regulation involves reversible changes in DNA methylation and/or histone modification patterns. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can direct DNA methylation and heterochromatic histone modifications, causing sequence-specific transcriptional gene silencing. In animals and yeast, histone H2B is known to be monoubiquitinated, and this regulates the methylation of histone H3 (refs 10, 11). However, the relationship between histone ubiquitination and DNA methylation has not been investigated. Here we show that mutations in an Arabidopsis deubiquitination enzyme, SUP32/UBP26, decrease the dimethylation on lysine 9 of H3, suppress siRNA-directed methylation of DNA and release heterochromatic silencing of transgenes as well as transposons. We found that Arabidopsis histone H2B is monoubiquitinated at lysine 143 and that the levels of ubiquitinated H2B and trimethyl H3 at lysine 4 increase in sup32 mutant plants. SUP32/UBP26 can deubiquitinate H2B, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest an association between H2B ubiquitination and release of silencing. These data suggest that H2B deubiquitination by SUP32/UBP26 is required for heterochromatic histone H3 methylation and DNA methylation.
