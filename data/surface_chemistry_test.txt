An object spinning at the surface of a liquid creates a chiral vortex. If the spinning object is itself chiral, its shape modifies the characteristics of the vortex; interactions between that vortex and other vortices then depend on the chirality of the objects that produce them. This paper describes the aggregation of millimeter-sized, chiral magnetized plates floating at a liquid-air interface and rotating under the influence of a rotating external magnetic field. This external field confines all the plates at densities that cause the vortices they generate to interact strongly. For one set of plates investigated, plates of one chirality attract one another, and plates of the other chirality repel other plates of both chiralities.
Dealloying is a common corrosion process during which an alloy is 'parted' by the selective dissolution of the most electrochemically active of its elements. This process results in the formation of a nanoporous sponge composed almost entirely of the more noble alloy constituents. Although considerable attention has been devoted to the morphological aspects of the dealloying process, its underlying physical mechanism has remained unclear. Here we propose a continuum model that is fully consistent with experiments and theoretical simulations of alloy dissolution, and demonstrate that nanoporosity in metals is due to an intrinsic dynamical pattern formation process. That is, pores form because the more noble atoms are chemically driven to aggregate into two-dimensional clusters by a phase separation process (spinodal decomposition) at the solid-electrolyte interface, and the surface area continuously increases owing to etching. Together, these processes evolve porosity with a characteristic length scale predicted by our continuum model. We expect that chemically tailored nanoporous gold made by dealloying Ag-Au should be suitable for sensor applications, particularly in a biomaterials context.
By the use of infrared internal reflection spectroelectrochemistry, it has been possible to observe an enhanced adsorption of porcine fibrinogen onto a germanium surface at potentials more positive than -200 millivolts relative to a saturated calomel electrode. The enhanced adsorption was observed directly at the interface between the solid and the aqueous solution.
Isolated, atomically thin conducting membranes of graphite, called graphene, have recently been the subject of intense research with the hope that practical applications in fields ranging from electronics to energy science will emerge. The atomic thinness, stability and electrical sensitivity of graphene motivated us to investigate the potential use of graphene membranes and graphene nanopores to characterize single molecules of DNA in ionic solution. Here we show that when immersed in an ionic solution, a layer of graphene becomes a new electrochemical structure that we call a trans-electrode. The trans-electrode's unique properties are the consequence of the atomic-scale proximity of its two opposing liquid-solid interfaces together with graphene's well known in-plane conductivity. We show that several trans-electrode properties are revealed by ionic conductance measurements on a graphene membrane that separates two aqueous ionic solutions. Although our membranes are only one to two atomic layers thick, we find they are remarkable ionic insulators with a very small stable conductance that depends on the ion species in solution. Electrical measurements on graphene membranes in which a single nanopore has been drilled show that the membrane's effective insulating thickness is less than one nanometre. This small effective thickness makes graphene an ideal substrate for very high resolution, high throughput nanopore-based single-molecule detectors. The sensitivity of graphene's in-plane electronic conductivity to its immediate surface environment and trans-membrane solution potentials will offer new insights into atomic surface processes and sensor development opportunities.
Direct measurements of electron transfer (ET) within a protein-protein complex with a redesigned interface formed by physiological partner proteins myoglobin (Mb) and cytochrome b(5) (b(5)) reveal interprotein ET rates comparable to those observed within the photosynthetic reaction center. Brownian dynamics simulations show that Mb in which three surface acid residues are mutated to lysine binds b(5) in an ensemble of configurations distributed around a reactive most-probable structure. Correspondingly, charge-separation ET from a photoexcited singlet zinc porphyrin incorporated within Mb to the heme of b(5) and the follow-up charge-recombination exhibit distributed kinetics, with median rate constants, k(f)(s) = 2.1 x 10(9) second(-1) and k(b)(s) = 4.3 x 10(10) second(-1), respectively. The latter approaches that for the initial step in photosynthetic charge separation, k = 3.3 x 10(11) second(-1).
The crystal structure of the trp repressor/operator complex shows an extensive contact surface, including 24 direct and 6 solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds to the phosphate groups of the DNA. There are no direct hydrogen bonds or non-polar contacts to the bases that can explain the repressor's specificity for the operator sequence. Rather, the sequence seems to be recognized indirectly through its effects on the geometry of the phosphate backbone, which in turn permits the formation of a stable interface. Water-mediated polar contacts to the bases also appear to contribute part of the specificity.
The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM) are scanning probe microscopes capable of resolving surface detail down to the atomic level. The potential of these microscopes for revealing subtle details of structure is illustrated by atomic resolution images including graphite, an organic conductor, an insulating layered compound, and individual adsorbed oxygen atoms on a semiconductor. Application of the STM for imaging biological materials directly has been hampered by the poor electron conductivity of most biological samples. The use of thin conductive metal coatings and replicas has made it possible to image some biological samples, as indicated by recently obtained images of a recA-DNA complex, a phospholipid bilayer, and an enzyme crystal. The potential of the AFM, which does not require a conductive sample, is shown with molecular resolution images of a nonconducting organic monolayer and an amino acid crystal that reveals individual methyl groups on the ends of the amino acids. Applications of these new microscopes to technology are demonstrated with images of an optical disk stamper, a diffraction grating, a thin-film magnetic recording head, and a diamond cutting tool. The STM has even been used to improve the quality of diffraction gratings and magnetic recording heads.
The dynamic nature of the first water adlayers on solid surfaces at room temperature has made the direct detection of their microscopic structure challenging. We used graphene as an atomically flat coating for atomic force microscopy to determine the structure of the water adlayers on mica at room temperature as a function of relative humidity. Water adlayers grew epitaxially on the mica substrate in a layer-by-layer fashion. Submonolayers form atomically flat, faceted islands of height 0.37 +/- 0.02 nanometers, in agreement with the height of a monolayer of ice. The second adlayers, observed at higher relative humidity, also appear icelike, and thicker layers appear liquidlike. Our results also indicate nanometer-scale surface defects serve as nucleation centers for the formation of both the first and the second adlayers.
The primary function of lung surfactant is to form monolayers at the alveolar interface capable of lowering the normal surface tension to near zero. To accomplish this process, the surfactant must be capable of maintaining a coherent, tightly packed monolayer that avoids collapse during expiration. The positively charged amino-terminal peptide SP-B1-25 of lung surfactant-specific protein SP-B increases the collapse pressure of an important component of lung surfactant, palmitic acid (PA), to nearly 70 millinewtons per meter. This alteration of the PA isotherms removes the driving force for "squeeze-out" of the fatty acids from the primarily dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine monolayers of lung surfactant. An uncharged mutant of SP-B1-25 induced little change in the isotherms, suggesting that a specific charge interaction between the cationic peptide and the anionic lipid is responsible for the stabilization. The effect of SP-B1-25 on fatty acid isotherms is remarkably similar to that of simple poly-cations, suggesting that such polymers might be useful as components of replacement surfactants for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome.
In traditional photoconductors, the impinging light generates mobile charge carriers in the valence and/or conduction bands, causing the material's conductivity to increase. Such positive photoconductance is observed in both bulk and nanostructured photoconductors. Here we describe a class of nanoparticle-based materials whose conductivity can either increase or decrease on irradiation with visible light of wavelengths close to the particles' surface plasmon resonance. The remarkable feature of these plasmonic materials is that the sign of the conductivity change and the nature of the electron transport between the nanoparticles depend on the molecules comprising the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) stabilizing the nanoparticles. For SAMs made of electrically neutral (polar and non-polar) molecules, conductivity increases on irradiation. If, however, the SAMs contain electrically charged (either negatively or positively) groups, conductivity decreases. The optical and electrical characteristics of these previously undescribed inverse photoconductors can be engineered flexibly by adjusting the material properties of the nanoparticles and of the coating SAMs. In particular, in films comprising mixtures of different nanoparticles or nanoparticles coated with mixed SAMs, the overall photoconductance is a weighted average of the changes induced by the individual components. These and other observations can be rationalized in terms of light-induced creation of mobile charge carriers whose transport through the charged SAMs is inhibited by carrier trapping in transient polaron-like states. The nanoparticle-based photoconductors we describe could have uses in chemical sensors and/or in conjunction with flexible substrates.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that chemistry at surfaces, whether it be heterogeneous catalysis, semiconductors etching, or chemical vapor deposition, is controlled by much more than the nature and structure of the surface. Recent experiments that principally make use of molecular beam techniques have revealed that the energy at which an incident molecule collides with a surface can be the key factor in determining its reactivity with or on the surface. In addition, the collision energy of an incident particle has proven essential to the finding of new mechanisms for reaction or desorption of molecules at surfaces, collision-induced activation and collision-induced desorption. These phenomena are often responsible for the different surface chemistry observed under conditions of high reactant pressure, such as those present during a heterogeneous catalytic reaction, and of low pressure of reactants (< 10(-4) torr), such as those present in an ultrahigh vacuum surface science experiment. This knowledge of the microscopic origins of the effect of pressure on the chemistry at surfaces has allowed the development of a scheme to bypass the high-pressure requirement. Reactions that are normally observed only at high reactant pressures, and which are the ones most often of practical importance, can now be carried out in low-pressure, ultrahigh vacuum environments.
When a drop of liquid dries on a solid surface, its suspended particulate matter is deposited in ring-like fashion. This phenomenon, known as the coffee-ring effect, is familiar to anyone who has observed a drop of coffee dry. During the drying process, drop edges become pinned to the substrate, and capillary flow outward from the centre of the drop brings suspended particles to the edge as evaporation proceeds. After evaporation, suspended particles are left highly concentrated along the original drop edge. The coffee-ring effect is manifested in systems with diverse constituents, ranging from large colloids to nanoparticles and individual molecules. In fact--despite the many practical applications for uniform coatings in printing, biology and complex assembly-the ubiquitous nature of the effect has made it difficult to avoid. Here we show experimentally that the shape of the suspended particles is important and can be used to eliminate the coffee-ring effect: ellipsoidal particles are deposited uniformly during evaporation. The anisotropic shape of the particles significantly deforms interfaces, producing strong interparticle capillary interactions. Thus, after the ellipsoids are carried to the air-water interface by the same outward flow that causes the coffee-ring effect for spheres, strong long-ranged interparticle attractions between ellipsoids lead to the formation of loosely packed or arrested structures on the air-water interface. These structures prevent the suspended particles from reaching the drop edge and ensure uniform deposition. Interestingly, under appropriate conditions, suspensions of spheres mixed with a small number of ellipsoids also produce uniform deposition. Thus, particle shape provides a convenient parameter to control the deposition of particles, without modification of particle or solvent chemistry.
A new approach is described for probing domains of ordered self-assemblies of amphiphilic monolayers at the aqueous solution interface. The method has potential importance for the study of membrane structure, Langmuir-Blodgett films, and nucleation processes of two-and three-dimensional crystals. Electron diffraction (ED) patterns indicative of two-dimensional crystalline self-assembly were obtained from samples, which were examined by cryo-electron microscopy, of monolayers of water-insoluble amphiphiles on vitrified aqueour substrates. The apparent hexagonal symmetry of an ED pattern from a C(16)H(33)OH monolayer was interpreted in terms of multiple twinning. Monolayers of the CL(31)H(63)OH and cadmium salt of C(19)H(39)CO(2)H that were studied by dark-field techniques displayed faceted two-dimensional crystallites with a maximal size of 1 to 2 micrometers. Epitaxial nucleation of hexagonal ice by the C(31)H(63)OH monolayer has also been demonstrated by ED.
The magnetic properties of surfaces are now being explored with electron spectroscopies that use electron spin polarization techniques. The increased activity in surface magnetic measurements with polarized electron beams is spurred by new scientific and technological challenges and is made feasible by recent advances in the technology of sources and detectors of polarized electrons. The ability to grow thin films and to engineer artificial structures permits new phenomena to be investigated at magnetic surfaces and interfaces. For such investigations, spin-polarized electron techniques-such as polarized electron scattering, polarized photoemission, polarized Auger spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis-have been and will probably continue to be used to great advantage.
Human lymphocytes have been shown to lyse in vitro a large variety of target cells derived from tumour as well as normal tissues. The effector cells involved in this spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity (SCMC) have generally been characterised as lymphocytes which lack surface membrane immunoglobulin (sIg) and lack or express only low-affinity receptors for sheep red blood cells (SRBC), but possess receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (refs 3--7). We have previously shown that monocytes may be involved in SCMC, as strong depletions of adherent cells always resulted in a reduction in SCMC. In the present study, experiments were undertaken to determine the role of monocytes in SCMC. Evidence is presented that monocytes have a helper function in the lymphocyte-mediated SCMC against target cells growing in monolayer cultures, whereas effector cells in SCMC against lymphoid target cells growing in suspension cultures were lysed by lymphocytes in the absence of monocytes.
Superhydrophobic surfaces are generally made by controlling the surface chemistry and surface roughness of various expensive materials, which are then applied by means of complex time-consuming processes. We describe a simple and inexpensive method for forming a superhydrophobic coating using polypropylene (a simple polymer) and a suitable selection of solvents and temperature to control the surface roughness. The resulting gel-like porous coating has a water contact angle of 160 degrees. The method can be applied to a variety of surfaces as long as the solvent mixture does not dissolve the underlying material.
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is central to reproduction in mammals. It acts through a G-protein-coupled receptor on the surface of target cells to stimulate testicular and ovarian functions. We present here the 2.9-A-resolution structure of a partially deglycosylated complex of human FSH bound to the extracellular hormone-binding domain of its receptor (FSHR(HB)). The hormone is bound in a hand-clasp fashion to an elongated, curved receptor. The buried interface of the complex is large (2,600 A2) and has a high charge density. Our analysis suggests that all glycoprotein hormones bind to their receptors in this mode and that binding specificity is mediated by key interaction sites involving both the common alpha- and hormone-specific beta-subunits. On binding, FSH undergoes a concerted conformational change that affects protruding loops implicated in receptor activation. The FSH-FSHR(HB) complexes form dimers in the crystal and at high concentrations in solution. Such dimers may participate in transmembrane signal transduction.
Soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) are type II transmembrane proteins that have critical roles in providing the specificity and energy for transport-vesicle fusion and must therefore be correctly partitioned between vesicle and organelle membranes. Like all other cargo, SNAREs need to be sorted into the forming vesicles by direct interaction with components of the vesicles' coats. Here we characterize the molecular details governing the sorting of a SNARE into clathrin-coated vesicles, namely the direct recognition of the three-helical bundle H(abc) domain of the mouse SNARE Vti1b by the human clathrin adaptor epsinR (EPNR, also known as CLINT1). Structures of each domain and of their complex show that this interaction (dissociation constant 22 muM) is mediated by surface patches composed of approximately 15 residues each, the topographies of which are dependent on each domain's overall fold. Disruption of the interface with point mutations abolishes the interaction in vitro and causes Vti1b to become relocalized to late endosomes and lysosomes. This new class of highly specific, surface-surface interaction between the clathrin coat component and the cargo is distinct from the widely observed binding of short, linear cargo motifs by the assembly polypeptide (AP) complex and GGA adaptors and is therefore not vulnerable to competition from standard motif-containing cargoes for incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles. We propose that conceptually similar but mechanistically different interactions will direct the post-Golgi trafficking of many SNAREs.
The entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into cells requires the sequential interaction of the viral exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with the CD4 glycoprotein and a chemokine receptor on the cell surface. These interactions initiate a fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Although gp120 can elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies, HIV eludes the immune system. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure at 2.5 A resolution of an HIV-1 gp120 core complexed with a two-domain fragment of human CD4 and an antigen-binding fragment of a neutralizing antibody that blocks chemokine-receptor binding. The structure reveals a cavity-laden CD4-gp120 interface, a conserved binding site for the chemokine receptor, evidence for a conformational change upon CD4 binding, the nature of a CD4-induced antibody epitope, and specific mechanisms for immune evasion. Our results provide a framework for understanding the complex biology of HIV entry into cells and should guide efforts to intervene.
Determining the factors that control food web interactions is a key issue in ecology. The empirical relationship between nutrient loading (total phosphorus) and phytoplankton standing stock (chlorophyll a) in lakes was described about 30 years ago and is central for managing surface water quality. The efficiency with which biomass and energy are transferred through the food web and sustain the production of higher trophic levels (such as fish) declines with nutrient loading and system productivity, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that in seston (fine particles in water) during summer, specific omega3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3-PUFAs), which are important for zooplankton, are significantly correlated to the trophic status of the lake. The omega3-PUFAs octadecatetraenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid, but not alpha-linolenic acid, decrease on a double-logarithmic scale with increasing total phosphorus. By combining the empirical relationship between EPA-to-carbon content and total phosphorus with functional models relating EPA-to-carbon content to the growth and egg production of daphnids, we predict secondary production for this key consumer. Thus, the decreasing efficiency in energy transfer with increasing lake productivity can be explained by differences in omega3-PUFA-associated food quality at the plant-animal interface.
Diamonds are formed under high pressure more than 150 kilometres deep in the Earth's mantle and are brought to the surface mainly by volcanic rocks called kimberlites. Several thousand kimberlites have been mapped on various scales, but it is the distribution of kimberlites in the very old cratons (stable areas of the continental lithosphere that are more than 2.5 billion years old and 300 kilometres thick or more) that have generated the most interest, because kimberlites from those areas are the major carriers of economically viable diamond resources. Kimberlites, which are themselves derived from depths of more than 150 kilometres, provide invaluable information on the composition of the deep subcontinental mantle lithosphere, and on melting and metasomatic processes at or near the interface with the underlying flowing mantle. Here we use plate reconstructions and tomographic images to show that the edges of the largest heterogeneities in the deepest mantle, stable for at least 200 million years and possibly for 540 million years, seem to have controlled the eruption of most Phanerozoic kimberlites. We infer that future exploration for kimberlites and their included diamonds should therefore be concentrated in continents with old cratons that once overlay these plume-generation zones at the core-mantle boundary.
The tripartite cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in eukaryotic cells. The subunits CdtA and CdtC associate with the nuclease CdtB to form a holotoxin that translocates CdtB into the host cell, where it acts as a genotoxin by creating DNA lesions. Here we show that the crystal structure of the holotoxin from Haemophilus ducreyi reveals that CDT consists of an enzyme of the DNase-I family, bound to two ricin-like lectin domains. CdtA, CdtB and CdtC form a ternary complex with three interdependent molecular interfaces, characterized by globular, as well as extensive non-globular, interactions. The lectin subunits form a deeply grooved, highly aromatic surface that we show to be critical for toxicity. The holotoxin possesses a steric block of the CdtB active site by means of a non-globular extension of the CdtC subunit, and we identify putative DNA binding residues in CdtB that are essential for toxin activity.
The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis had a profound impact on the Earth's surface chemistry, leading to a sharp rise in atmospheric oxygen between 2.45 and 2.32 billion years (Gyr) ago and the onset of extreme ice ages. The oldest widely accepted evidence for oxygenic photosynthesis has come from hydrocarbons extracted from approximately 2.7-Gyr-old shales in the Pilbara Craton, Australia, which contain traces of biomarkers (molecular fossils) indicative of eukaryotes and suggestive of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria. The soluble hydrocarbons were interpreted to be indigenous and syngenetic despite metamorphic alteration and extreme enrichment (10-20 per thousand) of (13)C relative to bulk sedimentary organic matter. Here we present micrometre-scale, in situ (13)C/(12)C measurements of pyrobitumen (thermally altered petroleum) and kerogen from these metamorphosed shales, including samples that originally yielded biomarkers. Our results show that both kerogen and pyrobitumen are strongly depleted in (13)C, indicating that indigenous petroleum is 10-20 per thousand lighter than the extracted hydrocarbons. These results are inconsistent with an indigenous origin for the biomarkers. Whatever their origin, the biomarkers must have entered the rock after peak metamorphism approximately 2.2 Gyr ago and thus do not provide evidence for the existence of eukaryotes and cyanobacteria in the Archaean eon. The oldest fossil evidence for eukaryotes and cyanobacteria therefore reverts to 1.78-1.68 Gyr ago and approximately 2.15 Gyr ago, respectively. Our results eliminate the evidence for oxygenic photosynthesis approximately 2.7 Gyr ago and exclude previous biomarker evidence for a long delay (approximately 300 million years) between the appearance of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria and the rise in atmospheric oxygen 2.45-2.32 Gyr ago.
The CD4 glycoprotein is expressed on T-helper and cytotoxic lymphocytes which are restricted to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens on target cells. Antibody inhibition studies imply that CD4 acts to increase the avidity of effector-target cell interactions. These observations have led to the speculation that CD4 binds to a monomorphic class II antigen determinant, thereby augmenting low affinity T-cell receptor-antigen interactions. However, no direct evidence has been presented indicating that CD4 and class II molecules interact. To address this issue, we have used a vector derived from simian virus 40 (SV40) to express a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the human CD4 glycoprotein. When CV1 cells expressing large amounts of the CD4 protein at the cell surface are incubated with human B cells bearing MHC-encoded class II molecules, they are bound tightly to the infected monolayer, whereas mutant B cells which lack class II molecules fail to bind. Furthermore, the binding reaction is specifically inhibited by anti-class II and anti-CD4 antibodies. Thus, the CD4 protein, even in the absence of T-cell receptor-antigen interactions, can interact directly with class II antigens to function as a cell surface adhesion molecule.
Venomous animals produce small protein toxins that inhibit ion channels with high affinity. In several well-studied cases the inhibitory proteins are water-soluble and bind at a channel's aqueous-exposed extracellular surface. Here we show that a voltage-sensor toxin (VSTX1) from the Chilean Rose Tarantula (Grammostola spatulata) reaches its target by partitioning into the lipid membrane. Lipid membrane partitioning serves two purposes: to localize the toxin in the membrane where the voltage sensor resides and to exploit the free energy of partitioning to achieve apparent high-affinity inhibition. VSTX1, small hydrophobic poisons and anaesthetic molecules reveal a common theme of voltage sensor inhibition through lipid membrane access. The apparent requirement for such access is consistent with the recent proposal that the sensor in voltage-dependent K+ channels is located at the membrane-protein interface.
The widely used 'silicon-on-insulator' (SOI) system consists of a layer of single-crystalline silicon supported on a silicon dioxide substrate. When this silicon layer (the template layer) is very thin, the assumption that an effectively infinite number of atoms contributes to its physical properties no longer applies, and new electronic, mechanical and thermodynamic phenomena arise, distinct from those of bulk silicon. The development of unusual electronic properties with decreasing layer thickness is particularly important for silicon microelectronic devices, in which (001)-oriented SOI is often used. Here we show--using scanning tunnelling microscopy, electronic transport measurements, and theory--that electronic conduction in thin SOI(001) is determined not by bulk dopants but by the interaction of surface or interface electronic energy levels with the 'bulk' band structure of the thin silicon template layer. This interaction enables high-mobility carrier conduction in nanometre-scale SOI; conduction in even the thinnest membranes or layers of Si(001) is therefore possible, independent of any considerations of bulk doping, provided that the proper surface or interface states are available to enable the thermal excitation of 'bulk' carriers in the silicon layer.
Neurotrophins are secreted growth factors critical for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system. Neurotrophins activate two types of cell surface receptors, the Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and the shared p75 neurotrophin receptor. We have determined the 2.4 A crystal structure of the prototypic neurotrophin, nerve growth factor (NGF), complexed with the extracellular domain of p75. Surprisingly, the complex is composed of an NGF homodimer asymmetrically bound to a single p75. p75 binds along the homodimeric interface of NGF, which disables NGF's symmetry-related second p75 binding site through an allosteric conformational change. Thus, neurotrophin signaling through p75 may occur by disassembly of p75 dimers and assembly of asymmetric 2:1 neurotrophin/p75 complexes, which could potentially engage a Trk receptor to form a trimolecular signaling complex.
Changes in chemical oxidation states in alloys and at solid-solid interfaces were monitored by using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. For an oxidized Nichrome surface, the chromium component was selectively converted to chromic oxide while nickel remained in the metallic state. When this surface was overlaid with a 20-angstrom-thick aluminum film, the chromic oxide was reduced to chromium and the aluminum was oxidized to aluminum oxide in a reaction zone consisting of no more than 10 angstroms of the interface. This scheme appeared general for solid-solid contacts and was predicted, to a first approximation, by bulk thermodynamic free energies.
Last month in Washington, D.C., the National Academy of Sciences held the first of what it hopes will be a series of seminars in forefront fields of science, technology, and medicine. The idea is to bring the academy closer to the frontlines of research and to help spread the word to federal science policy-makers. The subject of the 23 and 24 March seminar was interfaces and thin films, and the talks, though tutorial in nature, contained a pleasantly large number of still unpublished results. Interfaces, such as the surface of a solid exposed to a liquid or gas, and thin films, whose properties are heavily influenced by interfaces, have long been of considerable technological importance and have always been so in biological processes, but researchers are now getting access to the experimental and theoretical tools needed to explore these complex physical systems that are neither ideally two-dimensional nor fully three-dimensional. The briefings that follow give a peek at three ways to probe interfaces involving liquids.
Initial water deposition on the moderately reactive precious metal surface Ru(0001) has been thought to produce an ice-like bilayer. However, calculations from first principles show that the wetting layer observed on Ru(0001) cannot be formed of undissociated water molecules. An energetically favorable alternative, consistent with the remarkable observation that the wetting layer's oxygen atoms are nearly coplanar, is a half-dissociated monolayer wherein water molecules and hydroxyl fragments are hydrogen-bonded in a hexagonal structure and hydrogen atoms bind directly to the metal.
Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electron density waves excited at the interfaces between metals and dielectric materials. Owing to their highly localized electromagnetic fields, they may be used for the transport and manipulation of photons on subwavelength scales. In particular, plasmonic resonant cavities represent an application that could exploit this field compression to create ultrasmall-mode-volume devices. A key figure of merit in this regard is the ratio of cavity quality factor, Q (related to the dissipation rate of photons confined to the cavity), to cavity mode volume, V (refs 10, 11). However, plasmonic cavity Q factors have so far been limited to values less than 100 both for visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Significantly, such values are far below the theoretically achievable Q factors for plasmonic resonant structures. Here we demonstrate a high-Q SPP whispering-gallery microcavity that is made by coating the surface of a high-Q silica microresonator with a thin layer of a noble metal. Using this structure, Q factors of 1,376 +/- 65 can be achieved in the near infrared for surface-plasmonic whispering-gallery modes at room temperature. This nearly ideal value, which is close to the theoretical metal-loss-limited Q factor, is attributed to the suppression and minimization of radiation and scattering losses that are made possible by the geometrical structure and the fabrication method. The SPP eigenmodes, as well as the dielectric eigenmodes, are confined within the whispering-gallery microcavity and accessed evanescently using a single strand of low-loss, tapered optical waveguide. This coupling scheme provides a convenient way of selectively exciting and probing confined SPP eigenmodes. Up to 49.7 per cent of input power is coupled by phase-matching control between the microcavity SPP and the tapered fibre eigenmodes.
We report a method to form multifunctional polymer coatings through simple dip-coating of objects in an aqueous solution of dopamine. Inspired by the composition of adhesive proteins in mussels, we used dopamine self-polymerization to form thin, surface-adherent polydopamine films onto a wide range of inorganic and organic materials, including noble metals, oxides, polymers, semiconductors, and ceramics. Secondary reactions can be used to create a variety of ad-layers, including self-assembled monolayers through deposition of long-chain molecular building blocks, metal films by electroless metallization, and bioinert and bioactive surfaces via grafting of macromolecules.
The motion of peritrichously flagellated bacteria close to surfaces is relevant to understanding the early stages of biofilm formation and of pathogenic infection. This motion differs from the random-walk trajectories of cells in free solution. Individual Escherichia coli cells swim in clockwise, circular trajectories near planar glass surfaces. On a semi-solid agar substrate, cells differentiate into an elongated, hyperflagellated phenotype and migrate cooperatively over the surface, a phenomenon called swarming. We have developed a technique for observing isolated E. coli swarmer cells moving on an agar substrate and confined in shallow, oxidized poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microchannels. Here we show that cells in these microchannels preferentially 'drive on the right', swimming preferentially along the right wall of the microchannel (viewed from behind the moving cell, with the agar on the bottom). We propose that when cells are confined between two interfaces--one an agar gel and the second PDMS--they swim closer to the agar surface than to the PDMS surface (and for much longer periods of time), leading to the preferential movement on the right of the microchannel. Thus, the choice of materials guides the motion of cells in microchannels.
Three ice-covered moons of Jupiter, in comparison with rocky planets and Earth's moon, produce radar echoes of astounding strengths and bizarre polarizations. Scattering from buried craters can explain these and other anomalous properties of the echoes. The role of such craters is analogous to that of the water droplets that create the apparition known as "the glory," the optically bright region surrounding an observer's shadow on a cloud. Both situations involve the electromagnetic phenomenon of total internal reflection at a dielectric interface, operating in a geometry that strongly favors exact backscattering. Dim surface craters are transformed into bright glory holes by being buried under somewhat denser material, thereby increasing the intensity of their echoes by factors of hundreds. The dielectric interface thus formed at the crater walls nicely accounts for the unusual polarizations of the echoes.
Influenza A virus is a major human and animal pathogen with the potential to cause catastrophic loss of life. The virus reproduces rapidly, mutates frequently and occasionally crosses species barriers. The recent emergence in Asia of avian influenza related to highly pathogenic forms of the human virus has highlighted the urgent need for new effective treatments. Here we demonstrate the importance to viral replication of a subunit interface in the viral RNA polymerase, thereby providing a new set of potential drug binding sites entirely independent of surface antigen type. No current medication targets this heterotrimeric polymerase complex. All three subunits, PB1, PB2 and PA, are required for both transcription and replication. PB1 carries the polymerase active site, PB2 includes the capped-RNA recognition domain, and PA is involved in assembly of the functional complex, but so far very little structural information has been reported for any of them. We describe the crystal structure of a large fragment of one subunit (PA) of influenza A RNA polymerase bound to a fragment of another subunit (PB1). The carboxy-terminal domain of PA forms a novel fold, and forms a deep, highly hydrophobic groove into which the amino-terminal residues of PB1 can fit by forming a 3(10) helix.
The nitrogenase enzyme system catalyzes the ATP (adenosine triphosphate)-dependent reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia during the process of nitrogen fixation. Nitrogenase consists of two proteins: the iron (Fe)-protein, which couples hydrolysis of ATP to electron transfer, and the molybdenum-iron (MoFe)-protein, which contains the dinitrogen binding site. In order to address the role of ATP in nitrogen fixation, the crystal structure of the nitrogenase Fe-protein from Azotobacter vinelandii has been determined at 2.9 angstrom (A) resolution. Fe-protein is a dimer of two identical subunits that coordinate a single 4Fe:4S cluster. Each subunit folds as a single alpha/beta type domain, which together symmetrically ligate the surface exposed 4Fe:4S cluster through two cysteines from each subunit. A single bound ADP (adenosine diphosphate) molecule is located in the interface region between the two subunits. Because the phosphate groups of this nucleotide are approximately 20 A from the 4Fe:4S cluster, it is unlikely that ATP hydrolysis and electron transfer are directly coupled. Instead, it appears that interactions between the nucleotide and cluster sites must be indirectly coupled by allosteric changes occurring at the subunit interface. The coupling between protein conformation and nucleotide hydrolysis in Fe-protein exhibits general similarities to the H-Ras p21 and recA proteins that have been recently characterized structurally. The Fe-protein structure may be relevant to the functioning of other biochemical energy-transducing systems containing two nucleotide-binding sites, including membrane transport proteins.
Binding of human growth hormone (hGH) to its receptor is required for regulation of normal human growth and development. Examination of the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of the complex between the hormone and the extracellular domain of its receptor (hGHbp) showed that the complex consists of one molecule of growth hormone per two molecules of receptor. The hormone is a four-helix bundle with an unusual topology. The binding protein contains two distinct domains, similar in some respects to immunoglobulin domains. The relative orientation of these domains differs from that found between constant and variable domains in immunoglobulin Fab fragments. Both hGHbp domains contribute residues that participate in hGH binding. In the complex both receptors donate essentially the same residues to interact with the hormone, even though the two binding sites on hGH have no structural similarity. Generally, the hormone-receptor interfaces match those identified by previous mutational analyses. In addition to the hormone-receptor interfaces, there is also a substantial contact surface between the carboxyl-terminal domains of the receptors. The relative extents of the contact areas support a sequential mechanism for dimerization that may be crucial for signal transduction.
Focal adhesion of leukocytes to the blood vessel lining is a key step in inflammation and certain vascular disease processes. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein expressed by cytokine-activated endothelium, mediates the adhesion of blood neutrophils. A full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) for ELAM-1 has now been isolated by transient expression in COS cells. Cells transfected with the ELAM-1 clone express a surface structure recognized by two ELAM-1 specific monoclonal antibodies (H4/18 and H18/7) and support the adhesion of isolated human neutrophils and the promyelocytic cell line HL-60. Expression of ELAM-1 transcripts in cultured human endothelial cells is induced by cytokines, reaching a maximum at 2 to 4 hours and decaying by 24 hours; cell surface expression of ELAM-1 protein parallels that of the mRNA. The primary sequence of ELAM-1 predicts an amino-terminal lectin-like domain, an EGF domain, and six tandem repetitive motifs (about 60 amino acids each) related to those found in complement regulatory proteins. A similar domain structure is also found in the MEL-14 lymphocyte cell surface homing receptor, and in granule-membrane protein 140, a membrane glycoprotein of platelet and endothelial secretory granules that can be rapidly mobilized (less than 5 minutes) to the cell surface by thrombin and other stimuli. Thus, ELAM-1 may be a member of a nascent gene family of cell surface molecules involved in the regulation of inflammatory and immunological events at the interface of vessel wall and blood.
Haemoglobin C, which carries a glutamate-to-lysine mutation in the beta-globin chain, protects West African children against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Mechanisms of protection are not established for the heterozygous (haemoglobin AC) or homozygous (haemoglobin CC) states. Here we report a marked effect of haemoglobin C on the cell-surface properties of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes involved in pathogenesis. Relative to parasite-infected normal erythrocytes (haemoglobin AA), parasitized AC and CC erythrocytes show reduced adhesion to endothelial monolayers expressing CD36 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). They also show impaired rosetting interactions with non-parasitized erythrocytes, and reduced agglutination in the presence of pooled sera from malaria-immune adults. Abnormal cell-surface display of the main variable cytoadherence ligand, PfEMP-1 (P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1), correlates with these findings. The abnormalities in PfEMP-1 display are associated with markers of erythrocyte senescence, and are greater in CC than in AC erythrocytes. Haemoglobin C might protect against malaria by reducing PfEMP-1-mediated adherence of parasitized erythrocytes, thereby mitigating the effects of their sequestration in the microvasculature.
The fusion of lipid membranes at the air-water interface has been detected with the use of x-ray reflection as a high-resolution, surface-sensitive technique. The rate of this fusion for dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayers is the highest at 29 degrees C, which coincides with the chain-melting phase-transition temperature for the top membrane layers. After 6 hours of incubation a stack of at least ten surface-ordered membrane bilayers in equilibrium with the bulk vesicle suspension is formed. Such fusion is thus surface-catalyzed but not restricted to the first surface layer. The process involves partial membrane dehydration near the solution surface which decreases toward the bulk.
The chemical dynamics of highly vibrationally excited molecules have been studied by measuring the quantum state-resolved scattering probabilities of nitric oxide (NO) molecules on clean and oxygen-covered copper (111) surfaces, where the incident NO was prepared in single quantum states with vibrational energies of as much as 300 kilojoules per mole. The dependence of vibrationally elastic and inelastic scattering on oxygen coverage strongly suggests that highly excited NO (v = 13 and 15) reacts on clean copper (111) with a probability of 0.87 +/- 0.05, more than three orders of magnitude greater than the reaction probability of ground-state NO. Vibrational promotion of surface chemistry on metals (up to near-unit reaction probability) is possible despite the expected efficient relaxation of vibrational energy at metal surfaces.
Inelastic helium atom scattering has been used to measure the phonons on a stepped metallic crystalline surface, Ni(977). When the scattering plane is oriented parallel to the step edges and perpendicular to the terraces, two branches of step-induced phonons are observed. These branches are identified as transversely polarized, step-localized modes that propagate along the step edge. Analysis reveals significant anisotropy in the force field near the step edge, with all forces near the step edge being substantially smaller than in the bulk. Such measurements provide valuable information on metallic bonding and interface stability near extended surface defects.
Monolayers on crystalline surfaces often form complex structures with physical and chemical properties that differ strongly from those of their bulk phases. Such hetero-epitactic overlayers are currently used in nanotechnology and understanding their growth mechanism is important for the development of new materials and devices. In comparison with crystals, quasicrystalline surfaces exhibit much larger structural and chemical complexity leading, for example, to unusual frictional, catalytical or optical properties. Deposition of thin films on such substrates can lead to structures that may have typical quasicrystalline properties. Recent experiments have indeed showed 5-fold symmetries in the diffraction pattern of metallic layers adsorbed on quasicrystals. Here we report a real-space investigation of the phase behaviour of a colloidal monolayer interacting with a quasicrystalline decagonal substrate created by interfering five laser beams. We find a pseudomorphic phase that shows both crystalline and quasicrystalline structural properties. It can be described by an archimedean-like tiling consisting of alternating rows of square and triangular tiles. The calculated diffraction pattern of this phase is in agreement with recent observations of copper adsorbed on icosahedral Al(70)Pd(21)Mn(9) surfaces. In addition to establishing a link between archimedean tilings and quasicrystals, our experiments allow us to investigate in real space how single-element monolayers can form commensurate structures on quasicrystalline surfaces.
Studies of C(60) overlayer growth on GaAs(110) with scanning tunneling microscopy show large first monolayer islands that are locally well ordered, structurally stable, and commensurate with the GaAs surface owing to molecule-substrate interactions. Within the distorted close-packed structure, two distinct adsorption sites were identified, one of them being elevated because of stress in the C(60) monolayer.
In a process called "molecular combining," DNA molecules attached at one end to a solid surface were extended and aligned by a receding air-water interface and left to dry on the surface. Molecular combing was observed to extend the length of the bacteriophage lambda DNA molecule to 21.5 +/- 0.5 micrometers (unextended length, 16.2 micrometers). With the combing process, it was possible to (i) extend a chromosomal Escherichia coli DNA fragment (10(6) base pairs) and (ii) detect a minute quantity of DNA (10(3) molecules). These results open the way for a faster physical mapping of the genome and for the detection of small quantities of target DNA from a population of molecules.
Intraocular lenses destroy corneal endothelial cells by contact adhesion between the acrylic lens and endothelial surfaces during cataract surgery. Glass and rubber surgical glove surfaces produce similar cell damage. This phenomenon may be important in many surgical procedures and appears to be preventable if a hydrophilic polymer interface is interposed between contacting tissue and the surfaces of materials used.
Inositol phospholipids have long been known to have an important regulatory role in cell physiology. The repertoire of cellular processes known to be directly or indirectly controlled by this class of lipids has now dramatically expanded. Through interactions mediated by their headgroups, which can be reversibly phosphorylated to generate seven species, phosphoinositides play a fundamental part in controlling membrane-cytosol interfaces. These lipids mediate acute responses, but also act as constitutive signals that help define organelle identity. Their functions, besides classical signal transduction at the cell surface, include regulation of membrane traffic, the cytoskeleton, nuclear events and the permeability and transport functions of membranes.
Movements of surface films counter to the interior stream are brought about by film pressure generated by surface tension gradients. In a similar process, the formation of new interfaces during protoplasmic syntheses could sustain gradients of interfacial tension with resulting protoplasmic movements.
This work demonstrates the practicality of forming two self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), independently but simultaneously, by adsorption of two different adsorbates from a common solution onto a substrate exposing two different materials at its surface. The experimental procedure and the degree of independence achieved in the resulting SAMs are illustrated by examination of monolayers obtained by adsorption of alkanethiols on gold and alkane carboxylic acids on alumina. This procedure provides a method for modifying the surface characteristics of microlithographically generated patterns and offers a versatile technique for controlling solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfacial properties in systems having patterns with dimensions of the order of 1 micrometer.
High-conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels encode negative feedback regulation of membrane voltage and Ca2+ signaling, playing a central role in numerous physiological processes. We determined the x-ray structure of the human BK Ca2+ gating apparatus at a resolution of 3.0 angstroms and deduced its tetrameric assembly by solving a 6 angstrom resolution structure of a Na+-activated homolog. Two tandem C-terminal regulator of K+ conductance (RCK) domains from each of four channel subunits form a 350-kilodalton gating ring at the intracellular membrane surface. A sequence of aspartic amino acids that is known as the Ca2+ bowl, and is located within the second of the tandem RCK domains, creates four Ca2+ binding sites on the outer perimeter of the gating ring at the "assembly interface" between RCK domains. Functionally important mutations cluster near the Ca2+ bowl, near the "flexible interface" between RCK domains, and on the surface of the gating ring that faces the voltage sensors. The structure suggests that the Ca2+ gating ring, in addition to regulating the pore directly, may also modulate the voltage sensor.
Neurotrophins (NTs) are important regulators for the survival, differentiation and maintenance of different peripheral and central neurons. NTs bind to two distinct classes of glycosylated receptor: the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and tyrosine kinase receptors (Trks). Whereas p75(NTR) binds to all NTs, the Trk subtypes are specific for each NT. The question of whether NTs stimulate p75(NTR) by inducing receptor homodimerization is still under debate. Here we report the 2.6-A resolution crystal structure of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) complexed to the ectodomain of glycosylated p75(NTR). In contrast to the previously reported asymmetric complex structure, which contains a dimer of nerve growth factor (NGF) bound to a single ectodomain of deglycosylated p75(NTR) (ref. 3), we show that NT-3 forms a central homodimer around which two glycosylated p75(NTR) molecules bind symmetrically. Symmetrical binding occurs along the NT-3 interfaces, resulting in a 2:2 ligand-receptor cluster. A comparison of the symmetrical and asymmetric structures reveals significant differences in ligand-receptor interactions and p75(NTR) conformations. Biochemical experiments indicate that both NT-3 and NGF bind to p75(NTR) with 2:2 stoichiometry in solution, whereas the 2:1 complexes are the result of artificial deglycosylation. We therefore propose that the symmetrical 2:2 complex reflects a native state of p75(NTR) activation at the cell surface. These results provide a model for NTs-p75(NTR) recognition and signal generation, as well as insights into coordination between p75(NTR) and Trks.
The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can be used to select a particular adsorbed molecule, probe its electronic structure, dissociate the molecule by using electrons from the STM tip, and then examine the dissociation products. These capabilities are demonstrated for decaborane(14) (B(10)H(14)) molecules adsorbed on a silicon(111)-(7 x 7) surface. In addition to basic studies, such selective dissociation processes can be used in a variety of applications to control surface chemistry on the molecular scale.
The structural basis for the divalent cation-dependent binding of heterodimeric alphabeta integrins to their ligands, which contain the prototypical Arg-Gly-Asp sequence, is unknown. Interaction with ligands triggers tertiary and quaternary structural rearrangements in integrins that are needed for cell signaling. Here we report the crystal structure of the extracellular segment of integrin alphaVbeta3 in complex with a cyclic peptide presenting the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence. The ligand binds at the major interface between the alphaV and beta3 subunits and makes extensive contacts with both. Both tertiary and quaternary changes are observed in the presence of ligand. The tertiary rearrangements take place in betaA, the ligand-binding domain of beta3; in the complex, betaA acquires two cations, one of which contacts the ligand Asp directly and the other stabilizes the ligand-binding surface. Ligand binding induces small changes in the orientation of alphaV relative to beta3.
An elastomeric stamp, containing defined features on the micrometer scale, was used to imprint gold surfaces with specific patterns of self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiols and, thereby, to create islands of defined shape and size that support extracellular matrix protein adsorption and cell attachment. Through this technique, it was possible to place cells in predetermined locations and arrays, separated by defined distances, and to dictate their shape. Limiting the degree of cell extension provided control over cell growth and protein secretion. This method is experimentally simple and highly adaptable. It should be useful for applications in biotechnology that require analysis of individual cells cultured at high density or repeated access to cells placed in specified locations.
Cholera toxin coupled to peroxidase yielded a highly specific ultrastructural marker of plasma membrane monosialogangliosides. Studies with cultures of brain and brain tumors suggested that long-term culture of tissue in monolayers results in eventual loss of surface monosialogangliosides.
The interfacial shear stress that occurs when a network of a polymer that is highly mobile at the segment level (an elastomer) is slid over a smooth surface of an immobile (glassy) polymer has been measured. The glassy material is covered by a thin layer of end-attached chains of the mobile material. The experiment was designed so that there were no free chains at the interface; the slip occurred between network chains on the one side and rigid material plus end-attached mobile chains on the other side. Two main results were obtained. (i) The interfacial shear stress is strongly affected by the segment mobility of the materials on both sides of the slip plane, and considerably lower stress is observed when the materials on both sides of the interface are highly mobile. (ii) Very thin layers of tethered chains can increase the interfacial friction. Both results are relevant to the understanding of a number of practical situations that range from the operation of thin layers of lubricants, such as those found in magnetic storage devices, to the problem of wall slip and melt fracture in polymer processing.
Nucleation, growth, and dissolution of crystals have been studied by stereochemical approach involving molecular recognition at interfaces. A methodology is described for using ;;tailor-made'' additives designed to interact stereospecifically with crystal surfaces during growth and dissolution. This procedure was instrumental in controlling crystal morphology and in revising the concept of the structure and symmetry of solid solutions. Consequently, it was applied to the transformation of centrosymmetric single crystals into solid solutions with polar arrangement displaying second-harmonic generation and to the performance of asymmetric synthesis of guest molecules inside centrosymmetric host crystals. The method has led to a discovery of a new ;;relay'' mechanism explaining the effect of solvent on crystal growth. Finally, it allowed for the design of auxiliary molecules that act as promoters or inhibitors of crystal nucleation that can be used to resolve enantiomers and crystallize desired polymorphs.
Spatially resolved infrared and ultraviolet wavelength spectra of Europa's leading, anti-jovian quadrant observed from the Galileo spacecraft show absorption features resulting from hydrogen peroxide. Comparisons with laboratory measurements indicate surface hydrogen peroxide concentrations of about 0.13 percent, by number, relative to water ice. The inferred abundance is consistent with radiolytic production of hydrogen peroxide by intense energetic particle bombardment and demonstrates that Europa's surface chemistry is dominated by radiolysis.
The spontaneous formation and coexistence of crystalline polymorphic trilayer domains in amphiphilic films at air-liquid interfaces is demonstrated by grazing incidence synchrotron x-ray diffraction. These polymorphic crystallites may serve as models for the early stages of crystal nucleation and growth, helping to elucidate the manner in which additives influence the progress of crystal nucleation, growth, and polymorphism and suggesting ways of selectively generating and controlling multilayers on liquid surfaces. Auxiliary molecules have been designed to selectively inhibit development of the polymorphs, leading primarily to a single phase monolayer.
Pancreatic lipase (triacylglycerol acyl hydrolase) fulfills a key function in dietary fat absorption by hydrolysing triglycerides into diglycerides and subsequently into monoglycerides and free fatty acids. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the human enzyme, a single-chain glycoprotein of 449 amino acids, by X-ray crystallography and established its primary structure by sequencing complementary DNA clones. Enzymatic activity is lost after chemical modification of Ser 152 in the porcine enzyme, indicating that this residue is essential in catalysis, but other data are more consistent with a function in interfacial recognition. Our structural results are evidence that Ser 152 is the nucleophilic residue essential for catalysis. It is located in the larger N-terminal domain at the C-terminal edge of a doubly wound parallel beta-sheet and is part of an Asp-His-Ser triad, which is chemically analogous to, but structurally different from, that in the serine proteases. This putative hydrolytic site is covered by a surface loop and is therefore inaccessible to solvent. Interfacial activation, a characteristic property of lipolytic enzymes acting on water-insoluble substrates at water-lipid interfaces, probably involves a reorientation of this flap, not only in pancreatic lipases but also in the homologous hepatic and lipoprotein lipases.
The theory and instrumentation for Fourier transform infrared spectrometry are discussed. These instruments measure infrared spectra of the same quality as spectra measured on grating spectrometers in about one thousandth of the time. Their sensitivity advantage for spectra measured in equal times is between a factor of 10 and 100. Commercial spectrometers are now available from nine vendors in North America. Important areas of chemistry include atmospheric monitoring, surface chemistry, and on-line identification of chromatographically separated materials. Many new biochemical and biomedical applications are also becoming apparent, including investigations of phase transitions in lipids and studies of the biocompatibility of implant polymers.
Porous tantalum disks, available as "slugs" from the capacitor industry, have large available surface area and a thin insulating coating of tantalum pentoxide. When implanted, they fill with extracellular fluid and operate as capacitor-stimulating electrodes having high capacitance per unit volume. Capable of stimulating excitable tissute without generating electrochemical by-products, these electrodes should provide a safer interface between neural prosthetic devices and human tissue.
Curare is known to be less effective as an acetycholine antagonist when the divalent cation concentration of the extracellular solution is increased. This observation can be accounted for by the negative surface potential on the end plate; an increase in divalent cation concentration decreases the negativity of the surface potential and thereby lowers the concentrations of cations at the membrane-solution interface. The concentration of divalent cations, such as curare, will be reduced more than the concentration of univalent cations, such as acetylcholine. The observations can be accounted for by a surface potential of about -50 millivolts. The same principle can explain the reported actions of divalent cations on the affinity of receptors for acetylcholine. The effects of surface potential on concentrations at active sites may play an important role in drug interactions.
Coupled surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are shown to provide effective transfer of excitation energy from donor molecules to acceptor molecules on opposite sides of metal films up to 120 nanometers thick. This variant of radiative transfer should allow directional control over the flow of excitation energy with the use of suitably designed metallic nanostructures, with SPPs mediating transfer over length scales of 10(-7) to 10(-4) meters. In the emerging field of nanophotonics, such a prospect could allow subwavelength-scale manipulation of light and provide an interface to the outside world.
The ion distribution in an electrolyte solution in contact with a charged polymerized phospholipid membrane was directly measured with long-period x-ray standing waves. The 27-angstrom-thick lipid monolayer was supported on a tungsten/silicon mirror. X-ray standing waves were generated above the mirror surface by total external reflection of a 9.8-kiloelectron volt x-ray beam from a synchrotron undulator. The membrane surface, which contained negatively charged phosphate headgroups, was bathed in a dilute ZnCl2 solution. The concentration of Zn2+ in the condensed layer at the membrane surface and the Zn2+ distribution in the diffuse layer were measured as a function of headgroup charge. The Debye length of the diffuse layer varied between 3 and 58 angstroms. The results qualitatively agree with the Gouy-Chapman-Stern model.
Phase transitions of adsorbed atoms and molecules on two-dimensional substrates are well explored, but similar transitions in the one-dimensional limit have been more difficult to study experimentally. Suspended carbon nanotubes can act as nanoscale resonators with remarkable electromechanical properties and the ability to detect adsorption at the level of single atoms. We used single-walled carbon nanotube resonators to study the phase behavior of adsorbed argon and krypton atoms as well as their coupling to the substrate electrons. By monitoring the resonance frequency in the presence of gases, we observed the formation of monolayers on the cylindrical surface, phase transitions within them, and simultaneous modification of the electrical conductance.
The macroscopic motion of liquids on a flat solid surface was manipulated reversibly by photoirradiation of a photoisomerizable monolayer covering the surface. When a liquid droplet several millimeters in diameter was placed on a substrate surface modified with a calix[4]resorcinarene derivative having photochromic azobenzene units, asymmetrical photoirradiation caused a gradient in surface free energy due to the photoisomerization of surface azobenzenes, leading to the directional motion of the droplet. The direction and velocity of the motion were tunable by varying the direction and steepness of the gradient in light intensity. The light-driven motion of a fluid substance in a surface-modified glass tube suggests potential applicability to microscale chemical process systems.
Despite the development of vaccines, the hepatitis B virus remains a major cause of human liver disease. The virion consists of a lipoprotein envelope surrounding an icosahedral capsid composed of dimers of a 183-residue protein, 'core antigen' (HBcAg). Knowledge of its structure is important for the design of antiviral drugs, but it has yet to be determined. Residues 150-183 are known to form a protamine-like domain required for packaging RNA, and residues 1-149 form the 'assembly domain' that polymerizes into capsids and, unusually for a capsid protein, is highly alpha-helical. Density maps calculated from cryo-electron micrographs show that the assembly domain dimer is T-shaped: its stem constitutes the dimer interface and the tips of its arms make the polymerization contacts. By refining the procedures used to calculate the map, we have extended the resolution to 9 A, revealing major elements of secondary structure. In particular, the stem, which protrudes as a spike on the capsid's outer surface, is a 4-helix bundle, formed by the pairing of alpha-helical hairpins from both subunits.
The interface between a two-dimensional (2D) molecular gas and a 2D molecular solid has been imaged with a low-temperature, ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunneling microscope. The solid consists of benzene molecules strongly bound to step edges on a Cu{111} surface. Benzene molecules on the Cu{111} terraces move freely as a 2D gas at 77 kelvin. Benzene molecules transiently occupy well-defined adsorption sites at the 1D edge of the 2D solid. Diffusion of molecules between these sites and exchange between the two phases at the interface are observed. On raised terraces of the copper surface, the 2D gas is held in a cage of the solid as in a 2D nanometer-scale gas bulb.
Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful spectroscopy technique that can provide non-destructive and ultra-sensitive characterization down to single molecular level, comparable to single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. However, generally substrates based on metals such as Ag, Au and Cu, either with roughened surfaces or in the form of nanoparticles, are required to realise a substantial SERS effect, and this has severely limited the breadth of practical applications of SERS. A number of approaches have extended the technique to non-traditional substrates, most notably tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) where the probed substance (molecule or material surface) can be on a generic substrate and where a nanoscale gold tip above the substrate acts as the Raman signal amplifier. The drawback is that the total Raman scattering signal from the tip area is rather weak, thus limiting TERS studies to molecules with large Raman cross-sections. Here, we report an approach, which we name shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, in which the Raman signal amplification is provided by gold nanoparticles with an ultrathin silica or alumina shell. A monolayer of such nanoparticles is spread as 'smart dust' over the surface that is to be probed. The ultrathin coating keeps the nanoparticles from agglomerating, separates them from direct contact with the probed material and allows the nanoparticles to conform to different contours of substrates. High-quality Raman spectra were obtained on various molecules adsorbed at Pt and Au single-crystal surfaces and from Si surfaces with hydrogen monolayers. These measurements and our studies on yeast cells and citrus fruits with pesticide residues illustrate that our method significantly expands the flexibility of SERS for useful applications in the materials and life sciences, as well as for the inspection of food safety, drugs, explosives and environment pollutants.
Fluorescence emission of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from the surface of perfused rat hearts was photographed to provide a two-dimensional recording of NADH levels. Sodium Amytal inhibition of NADH oxidation resulted in a homogeneous increase in NADH fluorescence, while lowering perfusion pressure from 55 to 10 torr caused a heterogeneous increase in NADH fluorescence, reflecting the heterogeneous oxygen delivery at this low pressure. Local ischemia resulted in a well-defined region of high NADH fluorescence that corresponded to the region of ischemic inslut. The sharp transition between the ischemic and normoxic areas demonstrated that the hypoxic interface separating the two areas must be quite small.
Concentration of the radio nuclide beryllium-7, produced by cosmic rays, was measured in waters collected from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This short-lived nuclide is well suited as a tracer for interactions at the air-sea interface and for the measurement of rapid mixing processes in the surface layer of the ocean.
Observations of tidal flow over a sill show that upstream solitary wave generation occurred in conjunction with the downstream movement of a streamline bifurcation over the obstacle crest. Solitary waves appeared upstream of the bifurcation, riding on the surface stratification. Shear flow instabilities on the plunging interface were also evident and may contribute to wave generation through subharmonic interaction. Nonlinear waves generated downstream of an internal control became trapped in the supercritical flow.
The Cascadia subduction zone is thought to be capable of generating major earthquakes with moment magnitude as large as M(w) = 9 at an interval of several hundred years. The seismogenic portion of the plate interface is mostly offshore and is currently locked, as inferred from geodetic data. However, episodic surface displacements-in the direction opposite to the long-term deformation motions caused by relative plate convergence across a locked interface-are observed about every 14 months with an unusual tremor-like seismic signature. Here we show that these tremors are distributed over a depth range exceeding 40 km within a limited horizontal band. Many occurred within or close to the strong seismic reflectors above the plate interface where local earthquakes are absent, suggesting that the seismogenic process for tremors is fluid-related. The observed depth range implies that tremors could be associated with the variation of stress field induced by a transient slip along the deeper portion of the Cascadia interface or, alternatively, that episodic slip is more diffuse than originally suggested.
The importance of surfaces and interfaces cannot be overstated, with their reach extending from the hardware of the digital age to the processes of life. The past half-century has seen the development of a full and varied toolkit for characterizing them. This toolkit is now serving a growing interdisciplinary community and is providing a powerful platform for scientific research and manufacturing technology.
Tubular aluminophosphate molecular sieve crystals were grown at an organic interface with their channels (7 angstroms in cross section) vertical to the substrate. To induce surface nucleation and oriented growth of AIPO(4)-5 crystals, organophosphonate layers cross-linked with Zr(IV) were assembled on a gold substrate and the modified substrate was immersed in a hydrothermal bath containing reagents for the synthesis of the molecular sieve. Reflection-absorption infrared studies demonstrated the stability of the phosphonate layers under these conditions. Drastic changes in the morphology of the surface-grown crystals from spherical agglomerates to vertical needles to thin tilted needles could be achieved by adjusting the water content of the synthesis bath. Nitrogen sorption in these structures on a piezoelectric device confirmed the presence of zeolitic microporosity.
Understanding the relative motion of objects in contact is essential for controlling macroscopic lubrication and adhesion, for comprehending biological macromolecular interfaces, and for developing submicrometre-scale electromechanical devices. An object undergoing lateral motion while in contact with a second object can either roll or slide. The resulting energy loss and mechanical wear depend largely on which mode of motion occurs. At the macroscopic scale, rolling is preferred over sliding, and it is expected to have an equally important role in the microscopic domain. Although progress has been made in our understanding of the dynamics of sliding at the atomic level, we have no comparable insight into rolling owing to a lack of experimental data on microscopic length scales. Here we produce controlled rolling of carbon nanotubes on graphite surfaces using an atomic force microscope. We measure the accompanying energy loss and compare this with sliding. Moreover, by reproducibly rolling a nanotube to expose different faces to the substrate and to an external probe, we are able to study the object over its complete surface.
Polar orientation of molecules in solids leads to materials with potentially useful properties such as nonlinear optical and electrooptical activity, electrochromism, and pyroelectricity. A simple self-assembly procedure for preparing such materials is introduced that yields multiple polar dye monolayers on solid surfaces joined by zirconium phosphate-phosphonate interlayers. Second harmonic generation (SHG) shows that the multilayers have polar order that does not decrease with increasing numbers (up to a large number) of monolayers in the film. The inorganic interlayers, as determined by SHG, impart excellent orientational stability to the dye molecules, with the onset of orientational randomization above 150 degrees C.
Hawaiian volcanoes are formed by the eruption of large quantities of basaltic magma related to hot-spot activity below the Pacific Plate. Despite the apparent simplicity of the parent process--emission of magma onto the oceanic crust--the resulting edifices display some topographic complexity. Certain features, such as rift zones and large flank slides, are common to all Hawaiian volcanoes, indicating similarities in their genesis; however, the underlying mechanism controlling this process remains unknown. Here we use seismological investigations and finite-element mechanical modelling to show that the load exerted by large Hawaiian volcanoes can be sufficient to rupture the oceanic crust. This intense deformation, combined with the accelerated subsidence of the oceanic crust and the weakness of the volcanic edifice/oceanic crust interface, may control the surface morphology of Hawaiian volcanoes, especially the existence of their giant flank instabilities. Further studies are needed to determine whether such processes occur in other active intraplate volcanoes.
