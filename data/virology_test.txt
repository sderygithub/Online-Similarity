The animal cell genome is organized into a series of replicons with an average size of 50-300 kilobases; each of these units is characterized by its own origin of replication which serves as the point of initiation for DNA synthesis. In animal viruses, origin usage can be regulated by cis-acting elements, and in some cases, replication may be cell-type specific. Little is known, however, about the organization and control of endogenous tissue-specific gene replication. To understand this process, we have used a replication direction assay to examine DNA fragments covering more than 200 kilobases of the human beta-like globin domain, and have identified a single bidirectional origin located upstream of the beta-globin itself. This locus is used to initiate DNA synthesis in expressing cells, where the globin domain replicates early, and in non-expressing cells, which are characterized by late replication of the same region. Deletion of this origin sequence, as occurs in the haemoglobin Lepore syndrome, cancels bidirectional DNA synthesis at this site and leads to a striking reversal of replication direction upstream to the locus. This represents the first genetic proof of the existence of specific, discrete origins of replication in animal cells.
The drug sensitivities of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates from a group of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) who were receiving zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoythymidine, AZT) therapy were tested by means of a newly developed plaque assay in CD4+ HeLa cells. Fifty percent inhibitory dose (ID50) values of 18 isolates from untreated individuals ranged between 0.01 microM and 0.05 microM. In contrast, most isolates from patients who had received zidovudine for 6 months or more exhibited decreased sensitivity characterized by changes in ID50 or ID95 values (or both), with isolates from several patients (5/15) showing 100-fold increases in ID50. The latter isolates were also insensitive to 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine; however, the isolates were still sensitive to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine, or phosphonoformate. It cannot be determined from this small sample of patients whether development of a less sensitive virus phenotype results in clinical resistance. Appearance of such variants was not associated with a consistent increase in viral p24 concentrations in patient plasma and did not herald any sudden deterioration in clinical status. More extensive studies are required to determine the clinical significance. Thus, it would be premature to alter any treatment protocols for HIV-infected individuals at present.
The homologue of the viral Kirsten ras (v-Ki-ras) gene found in the human lung carcinoma cell line, Calu-1, has an intron-exon structure similar to that of the human homologue of the viral Harvey ras (v-Ha-ras) gene. A second, potential fourth coding exon is present in the human Ki-ras gene and similar sequences are found in the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus. Cysteine is encoded at the twelfth amino acid position, suggesting that the Calu-1 Ki-ras gene has undergone a mutational activation at the same position as the human Ha-ras gene of the bladder carcinoma cell line, T24. A comparison of their predicted amino acid sequences suggests that ras proteins have a 'constant' region and a 'variable' region. Here we propose a common modular structure for ras gene products in which the variable region forms a physiologically important combining site.
Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that activate and direct the migration of leukocytes. There are two subfamilies, the CXC and the CC chemokines. We recently found that the CXC-chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a highly efficacious lymphocyte chemoattractant. Chemokines act on responsive leukocyte subsets through G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors, which are also used by distinct strains of HIV-1 as cofactors for viral entry. Laboratory-adapted and some T-cell-line-tropic (T-tropic) primary viruses use the orphan chemokine receptor LESTR/fusin (also known as fusin), whereas macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 isolates use CCR-5 and CCR-3 (refs 7-11), which are receptors for known CC chemokines. Testing of potential receptors demonstrated that SDF-1 signalled through, and hence 'adopted', the orphan receptor LESTR, which we therefore designate CXC-chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR-4). SDF-1 induced an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ and chemotaxis in CXCR-4-transfected cells. Because SDF-1 is a biological ligand for the HIV-1 entry cofactor LESTR, we tested whether it inhibited HIV-1. SDF-1 inhibited infection by T-tropic HIV-1 of HeLa-CD4 cells, CXCR-4 transfectants, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but did not affect CCR-5-mediated infection by macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) and dual-tropic primary HIV-1.
The T antigen specified by SV40 virus is the only viral-encoded protein required for replication of SV40 DNA. T antigen has two activities that appear to be essential for viral DNA replication: specific binding to duplex DNA at the origin of replication and helicase activity that unwinds the two DNA strands. As judged by electron microscopy, DNA unwinding is initiated at the origin of replication and proceeds bidirectionally. Either linear or circular DNA molecules containing the origin of replication are effective substrates; with closed circular DNA, a topoisomerase capable of removing positive superhelical turns is required for an efficient reaction. Presence of an origin sequence on duplex DNA and a single-strand DNA-binding protein appear to be the only requirements for T antigen to catalyze unwinding. This reaction mediated by T antigen defines a likely pathway to precise initiation of DNA replication: (i) the sequence-specific binding activity locates the origin sequence, (ii) the duplex DNA is unwound at this site, and (iii) the DNA polymerase and primase begin DNA replication. A similar pathway has been inferred for the localized initiation of DNA replication by bacteriophage lambda and by Escherichia coli in which a sequence-specific binding protein locates the origin and directs the DnaB helicase to this site. Observations with the SV40 system indicate that localized initiation of duplex DNA replication may be similar for prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Retroviruses encode a protease which needs to be active for the production of infectious virions. A disabling mutation in the protease results in the production of non-infectious virus particles and examination of proteins from these mutant virions reveals unprocessed Gag and Gag-Pol precursor proteins, the substrates of the viral protease. Each amino acid of the HIV-1 protease was individually mutated using a simple mutagenesis procedure which is capable of introducing and identifying missense mutations in each residue of a protein. Phenotypic screening of these mutants in a heterologous assay system reveals three regions within the protease where multiple consecutive amino-acid residues are sensitive to mutation. These results show that random mutagenesis can be used to identify functionally important regions within a protein. Mutants with conditional phenotypes have also been identified within this collection.
The retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor protein Rb inhibits cell proliferation by repressing a subset of genes that are controlled by the E2F family of transcription factors and which are involved in progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. Rb, which is recruited to target promoters by E2F1, represses transcription by masking the E2F1 transactivation domain and by inhibiting surrounding enhancer elements, an active repression that could be crucial for the proper control of progression through the cell cycle. Some transcriptional regulators act by acetylating or deacetylating the tails protruding from the core histones, thereby modulating the local structure of chromatin: for example, some transcriptional repressors function through the recruitment of histone deacetylases. We show here that the histone deacetylase HDAC1 physically interacts and cooperates with Rb. In HDAC1, the sequence involved is an LXCXE motif, similar to that used by viral transforming proteins to contact Rb. Our results strongly suggest that the Rb/HDAC1 complex is a key element in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation and that it is a likely target for transforming viruses.
Both human and murine cytotoxic T cells (CTL) elicited in response to infection with influenza A viruses have been shown to be specific for internal viral proteins, such as the matrix and nucleoprotein. Individual CTL epitopes have been identified in the nucleoprotein by successfully substituting short synthetic peptides for the intact virus in the preparation of target cells in cytotoxicity assays. The defined peptide epitopes have each been recognized by CTL in association with individual class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, H-2Db, H-2Kk, H-2Kd (Taylor, P. et al., unpublished data) and HLA-B37. A logical strategy to investigate the molecular details of the interaction between antigen and MHC class I proteins would be to define an epitope recognized by the MHC class I molecule HLA-A2. This is because the amino-acid sequence is known, several variants of A2 have been characterized and the protein has been purified and crystallized. Here we describe a peptide derived from the influenza matrix protein that is recognized by human CTL in association with the HLA-A2 molecule.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) exists in humans in a latent form that can be activated. To characterize the molecular basis of the cell-virus interactions and to analyze the state of the latent HSV genome, an in vitro model system was established. In this system a large fraction of the latently infected cells contain an HSV genome that can be activated. Cell survival was reduced minimally after repression of high multiplicity HSV type 1 (HSV-1) infection of human fibroblast cells with (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine in combination with human leukocyte interferon (IFN-alpha). A minimum of 1 to 3 percent of the surviving cells contained an HSV genome that could be activated either by human cytomegalovirus superinfection or reduction in incubation temperature.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a major medical problem. Antiviral treatment is only partially effective and a vaccine does not exist. Development of more effective therapies has been hampered by the lack of a suitable small animal model. Although xenotransplantation of immunodeficient mice with human hepatocytes has shown promise, these models are subject to important challenges. Building on the previous observation that CD81 and occludin comprise the minimal human factors required to render mouse cells permissive to HCV entry in vitro, we attempted murine humanization via a genetic approach. Here we show that expression of two human genes is sufficient to allow HCV infection of fully immunocompetent inbred mice. We establish a precedent for applying mouse genetics to dissect viral entry and validate the role of scavenger receptor type B class I for HCV uptake. We demonstrate that HCV can be blocked by passive immunization, as well as showing that a recombinant vaccinia virus vector induces humoral immunity and confers partial protection against heterologous challenge. This system recapitulates a portion of the HCV life cycle in an immunocompetent rodent for the first time, opening opportunities for studying viral pathogenesis and immunity and comprising an effective platform for testing HCV entry inhibitors in vivo.
Oligonucleotides complementary to regions of U1 and U2 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), when injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, rapidly induced the specific degradation of U1 and U2 snRNAs, respectively, and then themselves were degraded. After such treatment, splicing of simian virus 40 (SV40) late pre-mRNA transcribed from microinjected viral DNA was blocked in oocytes. If before introduction of SV40 DNA into oocytes HeLa cell U1 or U2 snRNAs were injected and allowed to assemble into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP)-like complexes, SV40 late RNA was as efficiently spliced as in oocytes that did not receive U1 or U2 oligonucleotides. This demonstrates that oocytes can form fully functional hybrid U1 and U2 snRNPs consisting of human snRNA and amphibian proteins.
Integrase is essential for human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) replication; however, potent inhibition of the isolated enzyme in biochemical assays has not readily translated into antiviral activity in a manner consistent with inhibition of integration. In this report, we describe diketo acid inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase that manifest antiviral activity as a consequence of their effect on integration. The antiviral activity of these compounds is due exclusively to inhibition of one of the two catalytic functions of integrase, strand transfer.
Simian sarcoma virus (SSV) deletion mutants were constructed from a molecular clone containing the entire infectious provirus. Transfection analysis of these mutants localized the SSV transforming gene to a small region of the viral genome encompassing its cell-derived sequence (v-sis). Antiserum to a peptide synthesized on the basis of the predicted amino acid sequence of the SSV transforming gene detected a 28,000-dalton protein that was specifically expressed in SSV transformed cells and that corresponded in size to that predicted from the v-sis coding sequence. The v-sis gene product designated p28sis was not a phosphoprotein, nor did it possess detectable protein kinase activity. These findings distinguish p28sis from a number of other retroviral onc proteins.
Dengue viruses occur as four antigenically related but distinct serotypes transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. These viruses generally cause a benign syndrome, dengue fever, in the American and African tropics, and a severe syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), in Southeast Asian children. This severe syndrome, which recently has also been identified in children infected with the virus in Puerto Rico, is characterized by increased vascular permeability and abnormal hemostasis. It occurs in infants less than 1 year of age born to dengue-immune mothers and in children 1 year and older who are immune to one serotype of dengue virus and are experiencing infection with a second serotype. Dengue viruses replicate in cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage, and subneutralizing concentrations of dengue antibody enhance dengue virus infection in these cells. This antibody-dependent enhancement of infection regulates dengue disease in human beings, although disease severity may also be controlled genetically, possibly by permitting and restricting the growth of virus in monocytes. Monoclonal antibodies show heterogeneous distribution of antigenic epitopes on dengue viruses. These epitopes serve to regulate disease: when antibodies to shared antigens partially neutralize heterotypic virus, infection and disease are dampened; enhancing antibodies alone result in heightened disease response. Further knowledge of the structure of dengue genomes should permit rapid advances in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of dengue.
Virally encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been discovered in herpesviruses. However, their biological roles are mostly unknown. We developed an algorithm for the prediction of miRNA targets and applied it to human cytomegalovirus miRNAs, resulting in the identification of the major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain B (MICB) gene as a top candidate target of hcmv-miR-UL112. MICB is a stress-induced ligand of the natural killer (NK) cell activating receptor NKG2D and is critical for the NK cell killing of virus-infected cells and tumor cells. We show that hcmv-miR-UL112 specifically down-regulates MICB expression during viral infection, leading to decreased binding of NKG2D and reduced killing by NK cells. Our results reveal a miRNA-based immunoevasion mechanism that appears to be exploited by human cytomegalovirus.
The development of retroviral vectors that target specific cell types could have important implications for the design of gene therapy strategies. A chimeric protein containing the polypeptide hormone erythropoietin and part of the env protein of ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus was engineered into the virus. This murine virus became several times more infectious for murine cells bearing the erythropoietin receptor, and it also became infectious for human cells bearing the erythropoietin receptor. This type of tissue-specific targeting by means of ligand-receptor interactions may have broad applications to a variety of gene delivery systems.
Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood leukocytes (hu-PBL-SCID mice) have inducible human immune function and may be useful as a small animal model for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) research. Hu-PBL-SCID mice infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) contained virus that was recoverable by culture from the peritoneal cavity, spleen, peripheral blood, and lymph nodes for up to 16 weeks after infection; viral sequences were also detected by in situ hybridization and by amplification with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mice could be infected with multiple strains of HIV-1, including LAV-1/Bru, IIIB, MN, SF2, and SF13. HIV-1 infection affected the concentration of human immunoglobulin and the number of CD4+ T cells in the mice. These results support the use of the hu-PBL-SCID mouse for studies of the pathogenesis and treatment of AIDS.
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) constitute an essential part of the immune response against viral infections. Such CTL recognize peptides derived from viral proteins together with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of infected cells, and usually require in vivo priming with infectious virus. Here we report that synthetic viral peptides covalently linked to tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteinyl-seryl-serine (P3CSS) can efficiently prime influenza-virus-specific CTL in vivo. These lipopeptides are able to induce the same high-affinity CTL as does the infectious virus. Our data are not only relevant to vaccine development, but also have a bearing on basic immune processes leading to the transition of virgin T cells to activated effector cells in vivo, and to antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules.
Two different temperature-sensitive conditional-lethal mutants of Sindbis virus, an animal virus that contains RNA, have been isolated. When cultured in chick fibroblast monolayers at 42 degrees C, these mutants yield less than 0.05 percent as much virus as does the wild type, whereas at 27 degrees C they grow normally. One mutant appears to be altered in the synthesis of a protein that is produced early in the infection and is required for viral RNA synthesis. The other mutant produces as much infectious RNA as the wild type at 42 degrees C and appears to be altered in the synthesis of a protein produced late in the infection.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is regarded as the main aetiologic factor in the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most frequent fatal malignancies worldwide. Detection of integrated HBV sequences in the cellular DNA of almost all HCCs studied, and the recent finding that the integrated HBV open reading frame (orf) X encodes a transactivating activity, supports the notion that integrated HBV DNA could contribute to liver carcinogenesis by activation of cellular genes in trans. But not all HCCs seem to harbour a functional orf X. We report here that 3'-truncated preS2/S sequences in integrated HBV DNA of liver cell carcinomas encode a so far unidentified transcriptional trans-activation activity. This activity is also produced by an artificially 3'-truncated preS2/S gene of the wild-type HBV genome. Besides the simian virus 40 promoter of the reporter plasmid pSV2CAT, the promoter of the human c-myc oncogene can also be activated. These results, taken together with the fact that preS/S is the only HBV gene found to be integrated in almost every HBV-related HCC analysed so far, indicate that trans-activation by integrated preS2/S sequences is a possible mechanism for HBV-associated oncogenesis.
The active exogenous murine leukemia virus sequences of mouse cells growing in culture are preferentially digested by deoxyribonuclease I in metaphase chromosomes. As determined by nuclear nick translation, all of the gene sequences of these cells active during interphase are in a deoxyribonuclease I-sensitive conformation during metaphase. This method of nick translation can therefore be used to label chromosomes in situ in order to visualize the active regions of the genome.
Recognition and destruction of virus-infected cells by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) is a central part of the immune system's attempts to control and eliminate virus infection. It is therefore not surprising that many viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with the processing and presentation of peptide antigen on class I MHC molecules (reviewed in ref. 1). These mechanisms act to prevent or reduce expression of MHC molecules at the cell surface. However, many natural killer (NK) cells are able to recognize and destroy host cells that no longer express class I MHC molecules (the 'missing self' hypothesis). Thus, any virus-infected cell that has lost cell-surface expression of MHC class I to avoid CTL attack should become susceptible to NK-cell-mediated destruction. We describe here the first example, to our knowledge, of a viral strategy to evade immune surveillance by NK cells.
Functional impairment and selective depletion of CD4+ T cells, the hallmark of AIDS, are at least partly caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type 1 binding to the CD4 molecule and infecting CD4+ cells. It may, therefore, be of therapeutic value to target an antiviral agent to CD4+ cells to prevent infection and to inhibit HIV-1 production in patients' CD4+ cells which contain proviral DNA. We report here that HIV-1 replication in normal primary CD4+ T cells can be inhibited by pokeweed antiviral protein, a plant protein of relative molecular mass 30,000, which inhibits replication of certain plant RNA viruses, and of herpes simplex virus, poliovirus and influenza virus. Targeting pokeweed antiviral protein to CD4+ T cells by conjugating it to monoclonal antibodies reactive with CD5, CD7 or CD4 expressed on CD4+ cells, increased its anti-HIV potency up to 1,000-fold. HIV-1 replication is inhibited at picomolar concentrations of conjugates of pokeweed antiviral protein and monoclonal antibodies, which do not inhibit proliferation of normal CD4+ T cells or CD4-dependent responses. These conjugates inhibit HIV-1 protein synthesis and also strongly inhibit HIV-1 production in activated CD4+ T cells from infected patients.
L1 sequences are a human-specific family of long, interspersed, repetitive elements, present as approximately 10(5) copies dispersed throughout the genome. The full-length L1 sequence is 6.1 kilobases, but the majority of L1 elements are truncated at the 5' end, resulting in a fivefold higher copy number of 3' sequences. The nucleotide sequence of L1 elements includes an A-rich 3' end and two long open reading frames (orf-1 and orf-2), the second of which encodes a potential polypeptide having sequence homology with the reverse transcriptases. This structure suggests that L1 elements represent a class of non-viral retrotransposons. A number of L1 complementary DNAs, including a nearly full-length element, have been isolated from an undifferentiated teratocarcinoma cell line. We now report insertions of L1 elements into exon 14 of the factor VIII gene in two of 240 unrelated patients with haemophilia A. Both of these insertions (3.8 and 2.3 kilobases respectively) contain 3' portions of the L1 sequence, including the poly (A) tract, and create target site duplications of at least 12 and 13 nucleotides of the factor VIII gene. In addition, their 3'-trailer sequences following orf-2 are nearly identical to the consensus sequence of L1 cDNAs (ref. 6). These results indicate that certain L1 sequences in man can be dispersed, presumably by an RNA intermediate, and cause disease by insertional mutation.
Unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are more frequent in the genomes of bacteria and viruses than of vertebrates. We report here that bacterial DNA and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides induce murine B cells to proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin in vitro and in vivo. This activation is enhanced by simultaneous signals delivered through the antigen receptor. Optimal B-cell activation requires a DNA motif in which an unmethylated CpG dinucleotide is flanked by two 5' purines and two 3' pyrimidines. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing this CpG motif induce more than 95% of all spleen B cells to enter the cell cycle. These data suggest a possible evolutionary link between immune defence based on the recognition of microbial DNA and the phenomenon of 'CpG suppression' in vertebrates. The potent immune activation by CpG oligonucleotides has implications for the design and interpretation of studies using 'antisense' oligonucleotides and points to possible new applications as adjuvants.
During infection by influenza virus, viral proteins become firmly attached to (or part of) host cell plasma membrane, nuclear membranes, mitochondrial, and microsomal membranes. Purified virus particles contain less than I percent host cell protein. Virus envelope proteins completely replace host membrane proteins in those discrete spots on the plasma membrane from which progeny virions bud out.
The bovine leukemia virus, like the human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV-I and HTLV-II), are unusual biologically in that viral transcripts are not detected in tumors or infected tissues. The bovine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (BLV LTR) functions as a transcriptional promoter only in cell lines productively infected with BLV. Deletion mapping indicated that at least two regions of the LTR, on the 5' and 3' sides of the RNA start site, influenced gene expression. An analysis has now been made of the effects of coupling sequences from these LTR regions to a heterologous core promoter derived from the SV40 early promoter unit. Through the use of the transient expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene to monitor transcriptional activity in vivo, two independent, regulatory elements were identified in the BLV LTR. One was present in a fragment of 75 base pairs derived from the U3 region of the LTR and behaved much like other enhancer elements. It may be a major determinant of BLV expression in productively infected cell lines, since it enhanced transcription controlled by the heterologous core promoter only in these cells. The second element was contained in a 250-bp fragment derived from LTR sequences in the R region, located downstream from the RNA start site. Its activation of CAT expression was not dependent on BLV infection and was evident only when the fragment was located immediately downstream from the RNA start site. BLV expression thus appears to be regulated in part by a cell-specific enhancer element upstream from the core promoter and a novel sequence downstream from the RNA initiation site in the viral LTR.
The spread of H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) from China to Europe has raised global concern about their potential to infect humans and cause a pandemic. In spite of their substantial threat to human health, remarkably little AIV whole-genome information is available. We report here a preliminary analysis of the first large-scale sequencing of AIVs, including 2196 AIV genes and 169 complete genomes. We combine this new information with public AIV data to identify new gene alleles, persistent genotypes, compensatory mutations, and a potential virulence determinant.
The basic principles of the architecture of many viral protein shells have been successfully established from electron microscopy and X-ray data, but enveloped viruses have been more difficult to study because they resist crystallization and are easily deformed when prepared for electron microscopy. To avoid the limitations of conventional techniques when applied to enveloped viruses, we have used a cryo-electron microscopy method in which unfixed and unstained viruses are observed in an unsupported thin layer of vitrified suspension. Because of electron beam damage, the many different views required for high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction cannot be obtained from a tilt series of the same particle. The images of many differently oriented viruses are combined using a novel reconstruction method, 'reconstruction by optimized series expansion' (ROSE). The structure of the envelope of Semliki Forest virus has been reconstructed to 3.5-nm resolution. The T = 4 geometry of the surface lattice, the shape of the trimeric spikes and their arrangement on the lipid bilayer are visualized.
Full-length poliovirus complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized by assembling oligonucleotides of plus and minus strand polarity. The synthetic poliovirus cDNA was transcribed by RNA polymerase into viral RNA, which translated and replicated in a cell-free extract, resulting in the de novo synthesis of infectious poliovirus. Experiments in tissue culture using neutralizing antibodies and CD155 receptor-specific antibodies and neurovirulence tests in CD155 transgenic mice confirmed that the synthetic virus had biochemical and pathogenic characteristics of poliovirus. Our results show that it is possible to synthesize an infectious agent by in vitro chemical-biochemical means solely by following instructions from a written sequence.
The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.
A scheme for partial purification of biologically active v-sis-coded protein from cells transformed with simian sarcoma virus (SSV) has made possible a functional comparison of the transforming protein with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The SSV-transforming gene product is capable of specifically binding PDGF receptors, stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF receptors, and inducing DNA synthesis in quiescent fibroblasts. Each of these activities was specifically inhibited by antibodies to different regions of the v-sis gene product. Moreover, viral infection of a variety of cell types revealed a strict correlation between those cells possessing PDGF receptors and those susceptible to transformation by SSV. These findings provide evidence that SSV-transforming activity is mediated by the interaction of a virus-coded mitogen with PDGF receptors.
The evolution of competitive interactions among viruses was studied in the RNA phage phi6 at high and low multiplicities of infection (that is, at high and low ratios of infecting phage to host cells). At high multiplicities, many phage infect and reproduce in the same host cell, whereas at low multiplicities the viruses reproduce mainly as clones. An unexpected result of this study was that phage grown at high rates of co-infection increased in fitness initially, but then evolved lowered fitness. Here we show that the fitness of the high-multiplicity phage relative to their ancestors generates a pay-off matrix conforming to the prisoner's dilemma strategy of game theory. In this strategy, defection (selfishness) evolves, despite the greater fitness pay-off that would result if all players were to cooperate. Viral cooperation and defection can be defined as, respectively, the manufacturing and sequestering of diffusible (shared) intracellular products. Because the low-multiplicity phage did not evolve lowered fitness, we attribute the evolution of selfishness to the lack of clonal structure and the mixing of unrelated genotypes at high multiplicity.
In sexual transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus, and early and later stages of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection, both viruses were found to replicate predominantly in CD4(+) T cells at the portal of entry and in lymphoid tissues. Infection was propagated not only in activated and proliferating T cells but also, surprisingly, in resting T cells. The infected proliferating cells correspond to the short-lived population that produces the bulk of HIV-1. Most of the HIV-1-infected resting T cells persisted after antiretroviral therapy. Latently and chronically infected cells that may be derived from this population pose challenges to eradicating infection and developing an effective vaccine.
The HLA-D region of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been shown to be homologous to the murine I region in terms of both structure and function. Both regions encode class II MHC molecules which restrict T-lymphocyte interactions with antigen-presenting cells. We have recently described the MHC restriction and antigen specificities of human T-lymphocyte clones directed at strain A influenza virus. The majority of T-lymphocyte clones recognized antigen in the context of cell surface interaction products encoded by HLA-D/DR genes. However, a few clones recognized antigen presented by cells histoincompatible for D/DR antigens. We report here that some of these clones recognized viral antigens in association with antigens encoded by genes identical with or closely linked to the recently described secondary B-cell (SB) locus of the MHC. This is the first report that SB-restricted antigen recognition may form an integral part of normal, human immune responses.
Cells infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) show decreased expression of the 58-kilodalton T4 (CD4) antigen on their surface. In this study, the effect of HIV infection on the synthesis of T4 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein products was evaluated in T-cell lines. Metabolically labeled lysates from the T4+ cell line Sup-T1 were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to T4. Compared with uninfected cells, HIV-infected Sup-T1 cells showed decreased amounts of T4 that coprecipitated with both the 120-kilodalton viral envelope and the 150-kilodalton envelope precursor molecules. In four of five HIV-producing T-cell lines studied, the steady-state levels of T4 mRNA were also reduced. Thus, the decreased T4 antigen on HIV-infected cells is due to at least three factors: reduced steady-state levels of T4-specific mRNA, reduced amounts of immunoprecipitable T4 antigen, and the complexing of available T4 antigen with viral envelope gene products. The data suggested that the T4 protein produced after infection may be complexed with viral envelope gene products within infected cells. Retroviral envelope-receptor complexes may thus participate in a general mechanism by which receptors for retroviruses are down-modulated and alterations in cellular function develop after infection.
The retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) contains transcriptional control elements that affect viral gene expression. By deletion mutagenesis of the genome of the cloned Abelson murine leukemia virus, regulatory signals could be mapped to at least three domains within the LTR. A defective 5' LTR that did not sustain transforming gene function was complemented by an intact LTR positioned at the 3' end of the genome. This versatility of the retroviral genome with respect to its transcriptional control elements appears to provide a strong selective advantage for viral gene expression.
Adenovirus type 12 transforms the fibroblastic BHK21 (baby hamster kidney) cell line into rounded or cuboidal cells that give rise in hamsters to undifferentiated small cell sarcomas indistinguishable from those induced in newborn hamsters by inoculation of the virus itself. In contrast. cells from this line transformed by polyoma virus retain their fibroblastic morphology and induce fibrosarcomas in hamsters. This suggests that the morphology of tumors induced by the adenovirus-transformed cells from this line may be determined by the viral genome and that such mechanism may also explain the remarkably uniform microscopic appearance which seems to characterize tumors induced in hamsters by direct inoculation of adenovirus type 12.
Analyses of DNA and RNA from avian leukosis virus (ALV)-induced lymphomas have provided strong evidence that, in most tumours, ALV induces neoplastic disease by activating the c-myc gene, the cellular counterpart of the transforming gene of MC29 virus. The data indicate that, as a rare event, the ALV provirus integrates adjacent to the c-myc gene and that transcription, initiating from a viral promoter, causes enhanced expression of c-myc, leading to neoplastic transformation.
Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent for adult T cell leukemia (ATL). The HTLV-I trans-activator protein Tax can activate the expression of its own long terminal repeat (LTR) and many cellular and viral genes. Tax down-regulated the expression of human beta-polymerase (hu beta-pol), a cellular enzyme involved in host cell DNA repair. This finding suggests a possible correlation between HTLV-I infection and host chromosomal damage, which is often seen in ATL cells.
The small DNA tumour virus simian virus 40 (SV40) has served as an excellent model for many studies on the mechanism and control of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The SV40 early region produces two protein products. One product (large-T antigen) is known both to repress early viral transcription and to stimulate viral replication by binding to specific sites in the origin-promoter region. The early promoter has several similarities to other RNA polymerase II promoters, for example, it possesses a TATA box, an upstream element and an enhancer. However, the SV40 early promoter differs from other known RNA polymerase II promoters in that the origin of viral DNA replication is embedded within it. Here we show that the SV40 early region is expressed at an extremely low level following its introduction ito human 293 cells, contrasting with results observed in a large number of other cells lines. We show further that the lack of expression is due to repression of transcription from the SV40 early promoter by viral DNA replication which occurs efficiently in 293 cells.
The adenovirus EIA and pseudorabies virus immediate early (IE) proteins induce transcription from transfected viral and nonviral genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (class II genes). These proteins have now been shown also to activate transcription of transfected genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (class III genes). As previously observed for class II genes, this stimulation of class III gene transcription was much greater for transfected genes than for the major endogenous cellular class III genes. Extracts made from cell lines stably expressing a transfected pseudorabies virus IE gene were 10 to 20 times more active in the in vitro transcription of exogenously added class III genes than extracts of the parental cell line. These results indicate that the E1A and IE proteins stimulate the expression of class III genes by a mechanism similar to the mechanism for stimulation of class II gene transcription by these proteins.
Many aspects of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle have not been reproduced in cell culture, which has slowed research progress on this important human pathogen. Here, we describe a full-length HCV genome that replicates and produces virus particles that are infectious in cell culture (HCVcc). Replication of HCVcc was robust, producing nearly 10(5) infectious units per milliliter within 48 hours. Virus particles were filterable and neutralized with a monoclonal antibody against the viral glycoprotein E2. Viral entry was dependent on cellular expression of a putative HCV receptor, CD81. HCVcc replication was inhibited by interferon-alpha and by several HCV-specific antiviral compounds, suggesting that this in vitro system will aid in the search for improved antivirals.
Cell-mediated (type-1) immunity is necessary for immune protection against most intracellular pathogens and, when excessive, can mediate organ-specific autoimmune destruction. Mice deficient in Eta-1 (also called osteopontin) gene expression have severely impaired type-1 immunity to viral infection [herpes simplex virus-type 1 (KOS strain)] and bacterial infection (Listeria monocytogenes) and do not develop sarcoid-type granulomas. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma production is diminished, and IL-10 production is increased. A phosphorylation-dependent interaction between the amino-terminal portion of Eta-1 and its integrin receptor stimulated IL-12 expression, whereas a phosphorylation-independent interaction with CD44 inhibited IL-10 expression. These findings identify Eta-1 as a key cytokine that sets the stage for efficient type-1 immune responses through differential regulation of macrophage IL-12 and IL-10 cytokine expression.
In polarized neurons, axons and dendrites perform different functions, which are reflected in their different molecular organization. Studies on the sorting of viral and endogenous glycoproteins in epithelial cells and hippocampal neurons suggest that there may be similarities in the mechanism of sorting in these two cell types. The mechanisms that maintain the distinct composition of the two plasma membrane domains in these two cell types must, however, be different. We have proposed the existence of a functional barrier at the axonal hillock/initial segment which prevents the intermixing of membrane constituents. Here we test this hypothesis by fusing liposomes containing fluorescent phospholipids into the plasma membrane of polarized hippocampal cells in culture. Fusion was induced by lowering the pH and mediated by influenza virus haemagglutinin expressed on the axonal surface of neurons infected with fowl plague virus. Labelling was found exclusively on axons after fusion. Although the fused lipids were mobile on the axonal membrane, no labelling was detected on the cell body and dendritic surfaces. These results suggest that there is a diffusion barrier at the axonal hillock/initial segment which maintains the compositional differences between the axonal and somatodendritic domains.
In most cats exposed to the contagious feline leukemia virus (FeLV), viral replication is contained in target haematopoietic tissues and elicits humoral immunity to FeLV and to the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA). Recently, we and others have considered that these ostensibly self-limiting infections might be persistent nonproductive (latent) infections in certain haematopoietic cells. This hypothesis could account for the relapsing viraemias, protracted incubation periods, persistently high titres of antiviral and anti-FOCMA antibodies, appearance of FeLV p27 antigen in serum of otherwise non-viraemic animals and occurrence of FeLV-negative but FOCMA-positive leukaemias in naturally infected pet cats. Here we describe the reactivation of latent FeLV from myelomonocytic and lymphoid cells of cats immune to FeLV, cats bearing FeLV-negative tumours, and kittens congenitally exposed to FeLV. Furthermore, the reappearance of FeLV infection is suppressed by the Host's immune system but his can be altered by adrenal corticosteroid hormones in vivo and in vitro.
C-type viruses are known to be aetiologically related to naturally occurring leukaemia in a variety of species, although the mechanisms of transformation are largely unknown. The long latency periods, requirement for an acute viraemia and monoclonality of the tumours distinguish leukaemogenesis from neoplasias induced by the acute transforming viruses and suggest an indirect mechanism. Consistent with this is the lack of in vitro transforming activity of replication-competent leukaemogenic viruses. We have shown previously that the presence of T cells which proliferate in vitro in response to viral antigens is uniquely associated with the conditions leading to leukaemia. Based on these observations we have hypothesized that chronic immune stimulation is required for leukaemogenesis. We now demonstrate that CBA/N mice, when inoculated as newborns with Moloney leukaemia virus (MoLV), develop an acute viraemia but do not develop leukaemia or have detectable T-cell responses against the virus. This supports the hypothesis that chronic immune stimulation is essential for leukaemogenesis.
Although New Zealand Black mouse embryo and adult tissues show evidence of murine leukemia viral particles and antigens, efforts to demonstrate biological activity of a murine leukemia virus by standard methods have proved negative. Cocultivation of tissues of these mice with non-virus-yielding hamster cells transformed by Moloney sarcoma virus, however, has resulted in the rescue of a pseudotype sarcoma virus, presumably carrying the New Zealand Black mouse leukemia virus coat. This virus has an unusual host restriction, producing foci of cell alteration only in rat cells.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous human herpesvirus, has the ability to transform human B lymphocytes. No other cell type has been experimentally transformed by EBV, either by intact virions or naked viral DNA and subgenomic fragments. Two immortalized human T-lymphoblastoid cell lines have now been established by transfecting cord blood lymphocytes with purified B95-8 viral DNA enclosed in fusogenic Sendai virus envelopes (RSVE) and then exposing the cells to EBV from a P3HR-1 cell subclone. One of these lines, which has been fully characterized, is termed HBD-1. This line is positive for EBV DNA and expresses surface OKT11, OKT4, and Tac receptors, but not M-1, mu immunoglobulin chains, EBV receptors, or B-1 surface markers. The cells contain fully rearranged T-cell receptor genes and germline immunoglobulin genes. The karyotype of the cells is normal, they do not require interleukin-2 for growth, and do not contain human T-lymphotropic virus type I. However, the HBD-1 cells contain incomplete EBV genomes and express several EBV-determined antigens, including the early antigen type D, membrane antigens, but not EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA). This association of the EBV genome with permanently growing hematopoietic cells of non B-cell lineage should prove useful in studies on the mechanism of EBV-mediated cell transformation.
Expression of viral genes in transgenic plants is a very effective tool for attenuating plant viral infection. Nevertheless, the lack of generality and risk issues related to the expression of viral genes in plants might limit the exploitation of this strategy. Expression in plants of antibodies against essential viral proteins could provide an alternative approach to engineer viral resistance. Recently, expression of complete or engineered antibodies has been successfully achieved in plants. The engineered single-chain Fv antibody scFv (refs 10, 11) is particularly suitable for expression in plants because of its small size and the lack of assembly requirements. Here we present evidence that constitutive expression in transgenic plants of a scFv antibody, directed against the plant icosahedral tombusvirus artichoke mottled crinkle virus, causes reduction of infection incidence and delay in symptom development.
Mammalian cells contain multiple copies of endogenous type C retroviral DNA sequences. Among these sequences are complete, potentially infectious proviruses, proviral DNA that is expressed only in the form of viral antigens, retroviral segments that may contribute portions of envelope (env) genes during the generation of recombinant polytropic viruses, and many subgenomic viral DNA segments that may not be expressed at all. We have previously reported the identification and molecular cloning of type C retroviral sequences from human DNA and have shown that the partial nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of one of the clones obtained (lambda 51) are homologous to Moloney MuLV (MoMuLV) in the gag and pol regions. The lambda 51 clone as well as several others isolated from a human DNA library contained approximately 4.3 kilobases (kb) of retroviral sequences, were deleted in the env region, and were flanked by tandem repeats unlike the long terminal repeats (LTRs) typically found in proviral DNAs (P.E.S., in preparation). We describe here the characterization of a full-length human retroviral clone (lambda 4-1) containing LTR elements as well as a putative env region. DNA-RNA hybridization experiments reveal that human cells contain species of poly(A)+ RNA that anneal to segments of the full-length retroviral DNA clone.
Although the murine retrovirus SL3-3 is highly leukaemogenic, in both the structure of its genome and in its properties of replication in tissue culture it closely resembles the nonleukaemogenic retrovirus Akv (refs 3, 4). An earlier investigation of the properties of recombinant SL3-3-Akv viruses localized the major determinant of leukaemogenicity outside the env gene, in a region of the viral genome that includes the gag gene and the noncoding long terminal repeat (LTR). To localize the determinant of SL3-3's leukaemogenicity more precisely we have now construced a recombinant provirus containing the LTR of SL3-3 and the coding region of Akv. The leukaemogenicity of these recombinants demonstrates that the determinant of leukaemogenicity lies within the SL3-3 LTR. Nucleotide sequencing of the LTRs of SL3-3 and Akv shows that they differ by a set of changes in the region thought to contain a transcriptional enhancer element. We suggest that enhancer region sequences are the major determinants of leukaemogenicity in these viruses.
Human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) encodes a trans-acting factor that activates the expression of genes linked to the HTLV-III long terminal repeat. By functional mapping of complementary DNA transcripts of viral messenger RNA's the major functional domain of the gene encoding this factor was localized to a region immediately before the env gene of the virus, a region previously thought to be noncoding. This newly identified gene consists of three exons, and its transcription into messenger RNA involves two splicing events bringing together sequences from the 5' part (287 base pairs), middle (268 base pairs), and 3'part (1258 base pairs) of the HTLV-III genome. A similar messenger RNA with a truncated second exon (70 base pairs) does not encode a trans-acting function. It is proposed that this second messenger RNA is the transcript of a gene (3'-orf) located after the env gene. Messenger RNA's were also identified for the env and gag-pol genes of HTLV-III.
Monotherapy with (-)2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) leads to the appearance of a drug-resistant variant of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) with the methionine-184 --> valine (M184V) substitution in the reverse transcriptase (RT). Despite resulting drug resistance, treatment for more than 48 weeks is associated with a lower plasma viral burden than that at baseline. Studies to investigate this apparent contradiction revealed the following. (i) Titers of HIV-neutralizing antibodies remained stable in 3TC-treated individuals in contrast to rapid declines in those treated with azidothymidine (AZT). (ii) Unlike wild-type HIV, growth of M184V HIV in cell culture in the presence of d4T, AZT, Nevirapine, Delavirdine, or Saquinavir did not select for variants displaying drug resistance. (iii) There was an increase in fidelity of nucleotide insertion by the M184V mutant compared with wild-type enzyme.
In late summer 1999, an outbreak of human encephalitis occurred in the northeastern United States that was concurrent with extensive mortality in crows (Corvus species) as well as the deaths of several exotic birds at a zoological park in the same area. Complete genome sequencing of a flavivirus isolated from the brain of a dead Chilean flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), together with partial sequence analysis of envelope glycoprotein (E-glycoprotein) genes amplified from several other species including mosquitoes and two fatal human cases, revealed that West Nile (WN) virus circulated in natural transmission cycles and was responsible for the human disease. Antigenic mapping with E-glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies and E-glycoprotein phylogenetic analysis confirmed these viruses as WN. This North American WN virus was most closely related to a WN virus isolated from a dead goose in Israel in 1998.
Molecular and antigenic analyses of three influenza viruses isolated from outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in racing greyhounds revealed that they are closely related to H3N8 equine influenza virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the canine influenza virus genomes form a monophyletic group, consistent with a single interspecies virus transfer. Molecular changes in the hemagglutinin suggested adaptive evolution in the new host. The etiologic role of this virus in respiratory disease was supported by the temporal association of rising antibody titers with disease and by experimental inoculation studies. The geographic expansion of the infection and its persistence for several years indicate efficient transmission of canine influenza virus among greyhounds. Evidence of infection in pet dogs suggests that this infection may also become enzootic in this population.
Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) causes a contagious lung cancer in sheep and goats, with significant animal health and economic consequences. The host range of JSRV is in part limited by species-specific differences in the virus entry receptor, hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2), which is not functional as a receptor in mice but is functional in humans. Sheep are immunotolerant of JSRV because of the expression of closely related endogenous retroviruses, which are not present in humans and most other species, and this may facilitate oncogenesis. Here we show that expression of the JSRV envelope (Env) protein alone in lungs of mice, by using a replication-incompetent adeno-associated virus vector, results in tumours with a bronchiolo-alveolar localization like those seen in sheep. Whereas lethal disease was observed in immunodeficient mice, tumour development was almost entirely blocked in immunocompetent mice. Our results provide a rare example of an oncogenic viral structural protein, show that interaction of the viral Env protein with the virus entry receptor Hyal2 is not required for tumorigenesis, and indicate that immune recognition of Env can protect against JSRV tumorigenesis.
Comparison of two closely related primate papovaviruses, simian virus 40 (SV40) and human BK virus (BKV), reveals that the only region of extensive divergence, the tandem sequences adjacent to the origins of DNA replication, is responsible in SV40 for enhancing early gene expression. This study demonstrates a similar enhancer function for the analogous repeated region in BKV. The dissimilarity in sequence of the BKV and SV40 enhancer elements suggests that they may have been acquired since SV40 and BKV diverged. A locus cloned from the human genome homologous to the BKV tandem repeats has been shown to function as low level enhancer element in mammalian cells. These data support the hypothesis that viral enhancer sequences may be evolutionarily related to host cell sequences.
Somatic cell hybrids between normal mouse cells and simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed human cells, which contained a diploid complement of mouse chromosomes and the human chromosome 7 carrying the genome of SV40, were tumorigenic in nude mice. One single copy of human chromosome 7 per hybrid cell appeared to be sufficient for the tumorigenicity of the hybrids.
As part of the viral infection cycle, viruses must package their newly replicated genomes for delivery to other host cells. Bacteriophage straight phi29 packages its 6.6-microm long, double-stranded DNA into a 42 x 54 nm capsid by means of a portal complex that hydrolyses ATP. This process is remarkable because entropic, electrostatic and bending energies of the DNA must be overcome to package the DNA to near-crystalline density. Here we use optical tweezers to pull on single DNA molecules as they are packaged, thus demonstrating that the portal complex is a force-generating motor. This motor can work against loads of up to 57 pN on average, making it one of the strongest molecular motors reported to date. Movements of over 5 microm are observed, indicating high processivity. Pauses and slips also occur, particularly at higher forces. We establish the force-velocity relationship of the motor and find that the rate-limiting step of the motor's cycle is force dependent even at low loads. Notably, the packaging rate decreases as the prohead is filled, indicating that an internal force builds up to approximately 50 pN owing to DNA confinement. Our data suggest that this force may be available for initiating the ejection of the DNA from the capsid during infection.
More than forty per cent of the mammalian genome is derived from retroelements, of which about one-quarter are endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Some are still active, notably in mice the highly polymorphic early transposon (ETn)/MusD and intracisternal A-type particles (IAP). ERVs are transcriptionally silenced during early embryogenesis by histone and DNA methylation (and reviewed in ref. 7), although the initiators of this process, which is essential to protect genome integrity, remain largely unknown. KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1, also known as tripartite motif-containing protein 28, TRIM28) represses genes by recruiting the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and the NuRD histone deacetylase complex, but few of its physiological targets are known. Two lines of evidence suggest that KAP1-mediated repression could contribute to the control of ERVs: first, KAP1 can trigger permanent gene silencing during early embryogenesis, and second, a KAP1 complex silences the retrovirus murine leukaemia virus in embryonic cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, here we show that KAP1 deletion leads to a marked upregulation of a range of ERVs, in particular IAP elements, in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and in early embryos. We further demonstrate that KAP1 acts synergistically with DNA methylation to silence IAP elements, and that it is enriched at the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of IAP genomes, where KAP1 deletion leads to the loss of histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), a hallmark of KAP1-mediated repression. Correspondingly, IAP 5'UTR sequences can impose in cis KAP1-dependent repression on a heterologous promoter in ES cells. Our results establish that KAP1 controls endogenous retroelements during early embryonic development.
The envelope of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) plays a central role in the process of virus entry into the host cell and in the cytopathicity of the virus for lymphocytes bearing the CD4 molecule. Mutations that affect the ability of the envelope glycoprotein to form syncytia in CD4+ cells can be divided into five groups: those that decrease the binding of the envelope protein to the CD4 molecule, those that prevent a post-binding fusion reaction, those that disrupt the anchorage of the envelope glycoprotein in the membrane, those that affect the association of the two subunits of the envelope glycoprotein, and those that affect post-translational proteolytic processing of the envelope precursor protein. These findings provide a functional model of the HIV envelope glycoprotein.
It has been amply documented that herpes simplex virus (HSV) persists in sensory ganglia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In contrast, HSV latency in the central nervous system (CNS) has not been well characterized. Corneal inoculation of virus results in a productive viral infection in the CNS during the first week after inoculation, indicating that the virus can progress from the PNS to the CNS. During latency, HSV has been found by co-cultivation of CNS tissue in only a very small fraction of inoculated mice. We have used here molecular hybridization techniques to analyse the fate of viruses that reach the CNS by anatomical pathways. We show that 6 days after corneal inoculation of HSV-1 a productive viral infection was present in brain tissue as well as in peripheral ganglia in at least 90%F of the inoculated mice. The mortality during this acute phase was only 2%. In the survivors, latent HSV could be recovered by explantation from 95% of the trigeminal ganglia, but only 5% of the brain tissue explants of the same mice yielded infectious virus. However, HSV DNA sequences were detected in the brains of 30% of mice which harboured latent HSV in their trigeminal ganglia. These results suggest that viruses that progress from the PNS into the CNS are not eliminated, but are capable of establishing a latent infection in the CNS that cannot be reactivated by explantation techniques.
Lentiviruses are a subfamily of retroviruses which have been aetiologically linked to the induction of arthritis, encephalitis, progressive pneumonia and slow neurological diseases in certain species. Relatively little is known about their genome structure, mechanisms of pathogenesis or evolutionary relationships with other retroviral subfamilies. In an effort to understand better the mechanisms by which these viruses induce such a variety of chronic diseases, we have molecularly cloned and physically characterized the genomes of caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) and equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) (A.Y. et al., in preparation). The latter, which bears some morphological similarity to the lentiviruses, has yet to be classified definitively as one. Here, we have determined the nucleotide sequence of a highly conserved region within the CAEV and EIAV pol genes. We demonstrate a much closer relationship of their predicted pol gene products to that of the presumed aetiological agent of human acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) than to those of other retroviruses. Additional pairwise comparisons allowed us to generate an evolutionary tree showing that the pol genes of lentiviruses and oncoviruses have evolved from a common progenitor.
DNA sequences homologous to the genomes of type C retroviruses are widespread among vertebrates. Ten genetic loci containing endogenous viral DNA sequences have been documented in the white Leghorn chicken alone. Six of these genetic loci are associated with the production of virus or of viral proteins in embryonic fibroblasts (refs 2--4, and S.M.A., L, B. Crittenden and E.G.B., in preparation) and one of the loci may be expressed in the erythroblasts of 5-day-old embryos. The abiquitous presence of endogenous viral genes among vertebrate species and the association of their expression with development of the haematopoietic system in the mouse have led to the proposal that these genes are involved in ontogeny. In addition, the genes may be implicated in oncogenesis as in the case of the AKR mouse in which a high incidence of spontaneous leukaemia is associated with the expression of endogenous murine laukaemia virus genomes. We report here the production of a fertile rooster which lacks avian leukosis virus-related endogenous viral genes and which seems to be completely normal and healthy. Thus, endogenous viral genes are apparently not essential for the normal development of the chicken. An endogenous virus-free state has also been reported for three species of jungle fowl and for the B-type viral genes of the mouse.
Cross-reactive antigens of molecular size of 61,000 to 68,000 daltons are found on the surface of human cells infected by human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV). They are recognized by antibodies from patients with adult T-cell leukemias and lymphomas, from healthy carriers of HTLV, and from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The latter finding has been one of the major reasons for suggesting an association of HTLV with AIDS. However, whether these antigens are of cellular or viral origin has not been clear. These antigens have now been shown to be associated with the presence of viral proteins in the cells, and a cross-reactive glycoprotein of molecular size of 46,000 daltons has been found to be a consistent structural part of viruses purified from several HTLV-producer cell lines. The findings thus suggest a viral (HTLV) origin of these antigens.
Measles virus is an aerosol-transmitted virus that affects more than 10 million children each year and accounts for approximately 120,000 deaths. Although it was long believed to replicate in the respiratory epithelium before disseminating, it was recently shown to infect initially macrophages and dendritic cells of the airways using signalling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1; also called CD150) as a receptor. These cells then cross the respiratory epithelium and transport the infection to lymphatic organs where measles virus replicates vigorously. How and where the virus crosses back into the airways has remained unknown. On the basis of functional analyses of surface proteins preferentially expressed on virus-permissive human epithelial cell lines, here we identify nectin-4 (ref. 8; also called poliovirus-receptor-like-4 (PVRL4)) as a candidate host exit receptor. This adherens junction protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily interacts with the viral attachment protein with high affinity through its membrane-distal domain. Nectin-4 sustains measles virus entry and non-cytopathic lateral spread in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial sheets infected basolaterally. It is downregulated in infected epithelial cells, including those of macaque tracheae. Although other viruses use receptors to enter hosts or transit through their epithelial barriers, we suggest that measles virus targets nectin-4 to emerge in the airways. Nectin-4 is a cellular marker of several types of cancer, which has implications for ongoing measles-virus-based clinical trials of oncolysis.
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope protein carrying the surface antigen (HBsAg) is assembled with cellular lipids in mammalian cells into empty viral envelopes. In a study to evaluate the capacity of such particles to present foreign peptide sequences in a biologically active form, in-phase insertions were created in the S gene encoding the major envelope protein. One of the sequences inserted was a synthetic DNA fragment encoding a poliovirus neutralization epitope. Mammalian cells expressing the modified gene secreted hybrid particles closely resembling authentic 22-nanometer HBsAg particles. These particles reacted with a poliovirus-specific monoclonal antibody and induced neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus. The results indicate that empty viral envelopes of HBV may provide a means for the presentation of peptide sequences and for their export from mammalian cells.
The McDonough strain of feline sarcoma virus (SM-FeSV) transforms fibroblast cell lines in culture and produces fibrosarcomas in domestic cats. SM-FeSV does not induce haematopoietic malignancies in spite of the fact that its viral oncogene, v-fms, codes for a glycoprotein related to the receptor for the mononuclear phagocyte colony stimulating factor, CSF-1. The v-fms-coded polypeptide includes the complete extracellular domain of the c-fms proto-oncogene product and retains the ability to bind CSF-1 specifically. The two molecules have very similar sequences except at their extreme carboxyl terminal ends where 40 amino acids of the c-fms-coded glycoprotein are replaced by 11 unrelated residues in the v-fms product. Autophosphorylation of the c-fms gene product on tyrosine is enhanced by CSF-1 addition, whereas phosphorylation of the v-fms-coded glycoprotein appears to be constitutive. We now show that introduction of the v-fms gene into simian virus-40 (SV40)-immortalized, CSF-1 dependent macrophages renders them independent of CSF-1 for growth and tumourigenic in nude mice. These factor-independent cell lines express unaltered levels of the c-fms product which is down-modulated in response to either CSF-1 or the tumour promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The induction of factor independence by a non-autocrine mechanism suggests that the v-fms product is an unregulated kinase that provides growth stimulatory signals in the absence of ligand.
The pol gene of Rous sarcoma virus is positioned downstream of the gag gene in a different, briefly overlapping reading frame; nevertheless, the primary translation product of pol is a gag-pol fusion protein. Two mechanisms, ribosomal frameshifting and RNA splicing, have been considered to explain this phenomenon. The frameshifting model is supported by synthesis of both gag protein and gag-pol fusion protein in a cell-free mammalian translation system programmed by a single RNA species that was synthesized from cloned viral DNA with a bacteriophage RNA polymerase. Under these conditions, the ratio of the gag protein to the fusion protein (about 20 to 1) is similar to that previously observed in infected cells, the frameshifting is specific for the gag-pol junction, and it is unaffected by large deletions in gag. In addition, synthesis of the fusion protein is ten times less efficient in an Escherichia coli cell-free translation system and cannot be explained by transcriptional errors or in vitro modification of the RNA. Ribosomal frameshifting may affect production of other proteins in higher eukaryotes, including proteins encoded by several retroviruses and transposable elements.
To generate an immune response, antigen-specific T-helper and T-killer cells must find each other and, because they cannot detect each other's presence, they are brought together by an antigen-loaded dendritic cell that displays antigens to both. This three-cell interaction, however, seems nearly impossible because all three cell types are rare and migratory. Here we provide a potential solution to this conundrum. We found that the three cells need not meet simultaneously but that the helper cell can first engage and 'condition' the dendritic cell, which then becomes empowered to stimulate a killer cell. The first step (help) can be bypassed by modulation of the surface molecule CD40, or by viral infection of dendritic cells. These results may explain the long-standing paradoxical observation that responses to some viruses are helper-independent, and they evoke the possibility that dendritic cells may take on different functions in response to different conditioning signals.
The CD4 (T4) molecule is expressed on a subset of T lymphocytes involved in class II MHC recognition, and is probably the physiological receptor for one or more monomorphic regions of class II MHC (refs 1-3). CD4 also functions as a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exterior envelope glycoprotein (gp120) (refs 4-9), being essential for virus entry into the host cell and for membrane fusion, which contributes to cell-to-cell transmission of the virus and to its cytopathic effects. We have used a baculovirus expression system to generate mg quantities of a hydrophilic extracellular segment of CD4. Concentrations of soluble CD4 in the nanomolar range, like certain anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, inhibit syncytium formation and HIV infection by binding gp120-expressing cells. Perhaps more importantly, class II specific T-cell interactions are uninhibited by soluble CD4 protein, whereas they are virtually abrogated by equivalent amounts of anti-T4 antibody. This may reflect substantial differences in CD4 affinity for gp120 and class II MHC.
Little is known of the fate of viruses involved in long-term obligatory associations with eukaryotes. For example, many species of parasitoid wasps have symbiotic viruses to manipulate host defenses and to allow development of parasitoid larvae. The complete nucleotide sequence of the DNA enclosed in the virus particles injected by a parasitoid wasp revealed a complex organization, resembling a eukaryote genomic region more than a viral genome. Although endocellular symbiont genomes have undergone a dramatic loss of genes, the evolution of symbiotic viruses appears to be characterized by extensive duplication of virulence genes coding for truncated versions of cellular proteins.
Functional impairment of antigen-specific T cells is a defining characteristic of many chronic infections, but the underlying mechanisms of T-cell dysfunction are not well understood. To address this question, we analysed genes expressed in functionally impaired virus-specific CD8 T cells present in mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and compared these with the gene profile of functional memory CD8 T cells. Here we report that PD-1 (programmed death 1; also known as Pdcd1) was selectively upregulated by the exhausted T cells, and that in vivo administration of antibodies that blocked the interaction of this inhibitory receptor with its ligand, PD-L1 (also known as B7-H1), enhanced T-cell responses. Notably, we found that even in persistently infected mice that were lacking CD4 T-cell help, blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway had a beneficial effect on the 'helpless' CD8 T cells, restoring their ability to undergo proliferation, secrete cytokines, kill infected cells and decrease viral load. Blockade of the CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) inhibitory pathway had no effect on either T-cell function or viral control. These studies identify a specific mechanism of T-cell exhaustion and define a potentially effective immunological strategy for the treatment of chronic viral infections.
Tyrosine protein kinases are important both in the normal regulation of cellular proliferation and in the oncogenic transformation of cells by several tumour viruses. The LSTRA Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV)-induced thymoma cell line contains approximately 20-fold more phosphotyrosine in protein than do typical haematopoietic cell lines; this seems to result from the expression of an abnormally high level of a cellular tyrosine protein kinase termed p56tck (refs 3, 4). This kinase is normally expressed at low levels in most, but not all, murine T cells. The elevated levels of p56tck could contribute to the malignant properties of LSTRA cells. Therefore, we have isolated cloned complementary DNAs encoding the whole of p56tck. Sequence analysis shows it to be a novel cellular tyrosine protein kinase which is distinct from all others described to date. p56tck is encoded in LSTRA cells by a hybrid messenger RNA; approximately 200 nucleotides at the 5' end of the mRNA are identical to the 5' end of the genome of M-MuLV. The three- to ninefold transcriptional activation of the gene therefore results from retroviral promoter insertion.
Antiviral T cells are thought to regulate whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections result in viral control, asymptomatic persistence or severe disease, although the reasons for these different outcomes remain unclear. Recent genetic evidence, however, has indicated a correlation between certain natural killer (NK)-cell receptors and progression of both HIV and HCV infection, implying that NK cells have a role in these T-cell-associated diseases. Although direct NK-cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells may contribute to antiviral defence during some virus infections--especially murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in mice and perhaps HIV in humans--NK cells have also been suspected of having immunoregulatory functions. For instance, NK cells may indirectly regulate T-cell responses by lysing MCMV-infected antigen-presenting cells. In contrast to MCMV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice seems to be resistant to any direct antiviral effects of NK cells. Here we examine the roles of NK cells in regulating T-cell-dependent viral persistence and immunopathology in mice infected with LCMV, an established model for HIV and HCV infections in humans. We describe a three-way interaction, whereby activated NK cells cytolytically eliminate activated CD4 T cells that affect CD8 T-cell function and exhaustion. At high virus doses, NK cells prevented fatal pathology while enabling T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, but at medium doses NK cells paradoxically facilitated lethal T-cell-mediated pathology. Thus, NK cells can act as rheostats, regulating CD4 T-cell-mediated support for the antiviral CD8 T cells that control viral pathogenesis and persistence.
The Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), which is used for the overexpression of eukaryotic genes and is being engineered for possible use as a viral insecticide, has a circular, supercoiled genome of approximately 128 kilobases. Despite its widespread use, little is known about the mechanism by which AcMNPV replicates. Evidence is presented in this report that AcMNPV origins of DNA replication are repeated sequences each containing several closely related imperfect palindromes that are present in six regions distributed around the genome. Although AcMNPV infection-dependent plasmid replication was initiated by a single complete palindrome, the amount of replication was substantially increased in plasmids containing six or eight palindromes.
Amantadine (or 1-adamantanamine) hydrochloride, a compound reported to be active against influenza viruses and Sendai virus, inhibited the growth of rubella virus in tissue culture. The antiviral activity appears at an early phase of the infection and is not due to direct inactivation of the virus.
Distinguishing self from non-self is a fundamental biological challenge. Many pathogens exploit the challenge of self discrimination by employing mimicry to subvert key cellular processes including the cell cycle, apoptosis and cytoskeletal dynamics. Other mimics interfere with immunity. Poxviruses encode K3L, a mimic of eIF2alpha, which is the substrate of protein kinase R (PKR), an important component of innate immunity in vertebrates. The PKR-K3L interaction exemplifies the conundrum imposed by viral mimicry. To be effective, PKR must recognize a conserved substrate (eIF2alpha) while avoiding rapidly evolving substrate mimics such as K3L. Using the PKR-K3L system and a combination of phylogenetic and functional analyses, we uncover evolutionary strategies by which host proteins can overcome mimicry. We find that PKR has evolved under intense episodes of positive selection in primates. The ability of PKR to evade viral mimics is partly due to positive selection at sites most intimately involved in eIF2alpha recognition. We also find that adaptive changes on multiple surfaces of PKR produce combinations of substitutions that increase the odds of defeating mimicry. Thus, although it can seem that pathogens gain insurmountable advantages by mimicking cellular components, host factors such as PKR can compete in molecular 'arms races' with mimics because of evolutionary flexibility at protein interaction interfaces challenged by mimicry.
In initial attempts to define the molecular events responsible for the latent state of herpes simplex virus, in situ hybridization was utilized to search for virally encoded RNA transcripts in latently infected sensory neurons. The use of cloned probes representing the entire viral genome indicated that transcripts encoded within terminal repeats were present. When the alpha genes encoding ICP-0, ICP-4, and ICP-27 and the gamma 1 gene encoding VP-5 were employed, only RNA transcripts hybridizing to the ICP-0 probe were detected. In latently infected cells, the ICP-0--related transcripts were localized principally in the nucleus; this was not the case in acutely (productively) infected neurons or in neurons probed for RNA transcripts coding for actin. In Northern blotting experiments, an RNA of 2.6 kilobases was detected with the ICP-0 probe. When single-stranded DNAs from the ICP-0 region were used as probes, RNA from the strand complementary to that encoding ICP-0 messenger RNA (mRNA) was the major species detected. This RNA species may play a significant role in maintaining the latent infection.
Transport of macromolecules into and out of nuclei, essential steps in gene expression, are potential points of control. The matrix protein (M protein) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was shown to block transport of RNAs and proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm of Xenopus laevis oocytes. The pattern of inhibition indicated that M protein interfered with transport that is dependent on the ras-like nuclear guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran-TC4 and its associated factors. This inhibition of nuclear transport by M protein explains several observations about the effects of VSV infection on host cell gene expression and suggests that RNA export is closely coupled to protein import.
Adenovirus E1A proteins prepare the host cell for viral replication, stimulating cell cycling and viral transcription through interactions with critical cellular regulatory proteins such as RB and CBP. Here we show that the E1A zinc-finger domain that is required to activate transcription of viral early genes binds to a host-cell multiprotein complex containing homologues of yeast Srb/Mediator proteins. This occurs through a stable interaction with the human homologue of Caenorhabditis elegans SUR-2, a protein required for many developmental processes in the nematode. This human Srb/Mediator complex stimulates transcription in vitro in response to both the E1A zinc-finger and the herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domains. Interaction with human Sur-2 is also required for transcription to be activated by the activation domain of a transcription factor of the ETS-family in response to activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase.
Human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) replicates actively in infected individuals, yet cells with intracellular depots of viral protein are observed only infrequently. Many cells expressing the HIV-1 Gag protein were detected at the surface of the nasopharyngeal tonsil or adenoid. This infected mucosal surface contained T cells and dendritic cells, two cell types that together support HIV-1 replication in culture. The infected cells were multinucleated syncytia and expressed the S100 and p55 dendritic cell markers. Eleven of the 13 specimens analyzed were from donors who did not have symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The interaction of dendritic cells and T cells in mucosa may support HIV-1 replication, even in subclinical stages of infection.
The polyomaviruses are non-enveloped, icosahedrally symmetrical particles with circular double-stranded DNA genomes. The outer shell of the virion contains 360 copies of viral protein VP1 (M(r) approximately 42K) arranged in pentamers. We report here the structure at 3.65 A resolution of murine polyomavirus ('polyoma') complexed with an oligosaccharide receptor fragment. This structure has been determined using the previously described model of simian virus 40 (SV40). Although very similar in structure to SV40, polyoma has interesting biological differences. Cell-surface N-acetyl neuraminic acid (sialic acid) is required for polyoma infectivity, but not for SV40. Polyoma attaches to the surface of susceptible cells by stereospecific recognition of oligosaccharides terminating in (alpha 2,3)-linked sialic acid. Studies of pathogenicity show that the specificity of viral binding to such oligosaccharides is an important determinant of the virus' ability to establish a disseminated infection and to induce tumours in the natural host. The complex described here show how polyoma recognizes the receptor fragment and how strains with different receptor specificities can distinguish between alternative ligands. The results also suggest an explanation for the large disparity in pathogenicity exhibited by strains differing in only one amino-acid residue of VP1.
Normal human cells undergo a limited number of divisions in culture and enter a non-dividing state called replicative senescence. Senescence is accompanied by several changes, including an increase in inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases and telomere shortening. The mechanisms by which viral oncogenes reverse these processes are not fully understood, although a general requirement for oncoproteins such as human papillomavirus E6 and E7 has suggested that the p53 and Rb pathways are targeted. Expression of the catalytic component of telomerase, hTERT, alone significantly extends the lifespan of human fibroblasts. Here we show that telomerase activity is not sufficient for immortalization of human keratinocyte or mammary epithelial cells: we find that neither addition of hTERT nor induction of telomerase activity by E6, both of which are active in maintaining telomere length, results in immortalization. Inactivation of the Rb/p16 pathway by E7 or downregulation of p16 expression, in combination with telomerase activity, however, is able to immortalize epithelial cells efficiently. Elimination of p53 and of the DNA-damage-induced G1 checkpoint is not necessary for immortalization, neither is elimination of p19ARF.
Fusion of viral and cellular membranes by the envelope glycoprotein gp120/gp41 effects entry of HIV-1 into the cell. The precursor, gp160, is cleaved post-translationally into gp120 and gp41 which remain non-covalently associated. Binding to both CD4 and a co-receptor leads to the conformational changes in gp120/gp41 needed for membrane fusion. We used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the protease-resistant part of a gp41 ectodomain solubilized with a trimeric GCN4 coiled coil in place of the amino-terminal fusion peptide. The core of the molecule is found to be an extended, triple-stranded alpha-helical coiled coil with the amino terminus at its tip. A carboxy-terminal alpha-helix packs in the reverse direction against the outside of the coiled coil, placing the amino and carboxy termini near each other at one end of the long rod. These features, and the existence of a similar reversal of chain direction in the fusion pH-induced conformation of influenza virus HA2 and in the transmembrane subunit of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (Fig. 1a-d), suggest a common mechanism for initiating fusion.
Transposons are mobile DNA segments that can disrupt gene function by inserting in or near genes. Here, we show that insertional mutagenesis by the PiggyBac transposon can be used for cancer gene discovery in mice. PiggyBac transposition in genetically engineered transposon-transposase mice induced cancers whose type (hematopoietic versus solid) and latency were dependent on the regulatory elements introduced into transposons. Analysis of 63 hematopoietic tumors revealed that PiggyBac is capable of genome-wide mutagenesis. The PiggyBac screen uncovered many cancer genes not identified in previous retroviral or Sleeping Beauty transposon screens, including Spic, which encodes a PU.1-related transcription factor, and Hdac7, a histone deacetylase gene. PiggyBac and Sleeping Beauty have different integration preferences. To maximize the utility of the tool, we engineered 21 mouse lines to be compatible with both transposon systems in constitutive, tissue- or temporal-specific mutagenesis. Mice with different transposon types, copy numbers, and chromosomal locations support wide applicability.
There may be drugs and a useful vaccine available to combat the hepatitis B virus, but one aspect of this pathogen remains a puzzle: the function of its HBx protein. As Ganem reveals in his Perspective, new findings (Bouchard et al.) show that this versatile viral protein is an activator of calcium-dependent Ras signaling, an observation that may explain many of its biological effects.
The myb-ets-containing acute leukemia virus, E26, transforms myeloblasts and erythroblasts in culture and causes a mixed erythroid and myeloid leukemia in chicks. Genes (ets-1, ets-2, and erg) with variable relatedness to the v-ets oncogene of the E26 virus have been identified, cloned, and characterized in several species. Two new members (elk-1 and elk-2) of the ets oncogene superfamily have now been identified. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the elk-1 cDNA clone revealed that this gene encodes a 428-residue protein whose predicted amino acid sequence showed 82% similarity to the 3' region of v-ets. The elk or related sequences appear to be transcriptionally active in testis and lung. The elk cDNA probe detects two loci in the human genome, elk-1 and elk-2, which map to chromosome regions Xp11.2 and 14q32.3, respectively. These loci are near the translocation breakpoint seen in the t(X;18) (p11.2;q11.2), which is characteristic of synovial sarcoma, and the chromosome 14q32 breakpoints seen in ataxia telangiectasia and other T cell malignancies. This suggests the possibility that rearrangements of elk loci may be involved in pathogenesis of certain tumors.
Human cells possess an antiviral activity that inhibits the release of retrovirus particles, and other enveloped virus particles, and is antagonized by the HIV-1 accessory protein, Vpu. This antiviral activity can be constitutively expressed or induced by interferon-alpha, and it consists of protein-based tethers, which we term 'tetherins', that cause retention of fully formed virions on infected cell surfaces. Using deductive constraints and gene expression analyses, we identify CD317 (also called BST2 or HM1.24), a membrane protein of previously unknown function, as a tetherin. Specifically, CD317 expression correlated with, and induced, a requirement for Vpu during HIV-1 and murine leukaemia virus particle release. Furthermore, in cells where HIV-1 virion release requires Vpu expression, depletion of CD317 abolished this requirement. CD317 caused retention of virions on cell surfaces and, after endocytosis, in CD317-positive compartments. Vpu co-localized with CD317 and inhibited these effects. Inhibition of Vpu function and consequent mobilization of tetherin's antiviral activity is a potential therapeutic strategy in HIV/AIDS.
Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is a retrovirus associated with adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. In addition to containing the gag, pol, and env genes of the chronic leukemia viruses, the genome of HTLV-I contains a long open reading frame (LOR) located between the 3' end of the envelope gene and the 3' long terminal repeat sequence (LTR). It has been suggested that a protein of 42 kilodaltons that is encoded by the LOR region may participate in both trans-acting transcriptional regulation of the viral LTR as well as in the transforming properties of HTLV-I. It is reported here that a significant fraction of the 42-kilodalton HTLV LOR product is located in the nucleus of HTLV-I-infected transformed lymphocytes, a finding that is consistent with its proposed functions.
Separate administration of polyribocytidylic acid [poly(rC)] and polyriboinosinic acid [poly(rI)] to cell cultures in vitro resulted in an antiviral activity identical to or greater than that resulting from addition of the poly(rI) * poly(rC) complex. Priming of cells with poly(rI), followed by treatment with poly(rC), gave a consistently greater antiviral activity than poly(rI) * poly(rC) itself. This priming effect was obtained in several cell cultures challenged with different viruses. In vivo, the antiviral activity of poly(rI) * poly(rC) was only partially restored if poly(rI) and poly(rC) were injected separately; prior injection of poly(rI) proved superior in restoring this antiviral activity as compared to prior injection of poly(rC).
Recombinant vaccinia viruses have been proposed as live vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases, including AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). Objections have been concerned primarily with side effects of the vaccinia virus vector itself. Recently it has been shown that inactivation of the vaccinia virus thymidine kinase gene or deletion of certain other non-essential genes is associated with a marked reduction in pathogenicity. Nevertheless, the ability of vaccinia virus to produce a progressive infection in immunodeficient individuals remains a most serious problem. Indeed, an incident of this type in a vaccinated man seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus was recently reported. We have used immunodeficient athymic nude mice to establish a model of disseminated vaccinia virus infection, and to demonstrate a novel approach to virus attenuation which involves insertion of a gene encoding human interleukin-2 into the genome of vaccinia virus vectors.
Reverse transcripts of the rna genome of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) as well as 125I-labeled BLV RNA hybridize to the DNA of tissues from leukemic cattle with the adult form of the disease but not to bovine thymic lymphoma or normal bovine tissues.
Extensive data on genetic divergence among 24 inbred strains of mice provide an opportunity to examine the concordance of gene trees and species trees, especially whether structured subsamples of loci give congruent estimates of phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic analyses of 144 separate loci reproduce almost exactly the known genealogical relationships among these 24 strains. Partitioning these loci into structured subsets representing loci coding for proteins, the immune system and endogenous viruses give incongruent phylogenetic results. The gene tree based on protein loci provides an accurate picture of the genealogical relationships among strains; however, gene trees based upon immune and viral data show significant deviations from known genealogical affinities.
The large genome of herpes simplex virus type of (HSV-1) encodes at least 80 polypeptides, the majority of which have no recognized function. A subgroup of these gene products appears to be nonessential for virus replication in cell culture, but contributes to the complex life cycle of the virus in the host. To identify such functions, a simple insertional mutagenesis method has been used for selective inactivation of individual HSV-1 genes. The bacterial transposon Tn5 was allowed to insert randomly into cloned restriction fragments representing the entire short unique (US) region of the HSV-1 genome. Of the 12 open reading frames that were mutagenized with Tn5, mutant derivatives of US2, US4, and US5 were recombined into the virus. These three genes proved to be nonessential for HSV-1 replication in Vero (African Green monkey kidney) cells and the US4 gene appeared to be involved in viral pathogenesis in the central nervous system of mice. This rapid mutagenesis procedure should prove useful in exploring the entire HSV-1 genome as well as the genomes of other complex animal viruses.
Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) commonly causes asymptomatic cutaneous neoplasms in children and sexually active adults as well as persistent opportunistic acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated disease. Sequencing the 190-kilobase pair genome of MCV has now revealed that the virus potentially encodes 163 proteins, of which 103 have homologs in the smallpox virus. MCV lacks counterparts to 83 genes of the smallpox virus, including those important in suppression of host responses to infection, nucleotide biosynthesis, and cell proliferation. MCV possesses 59 genes that are predicted to encode previously uncharacterized proteins, including major histocompatibility complex class I, chemokine, and glutathione peroxidase homologs, which suggests that there are MCV-specific strategies for coexistence with the human host.
The complete nucleotide sequence of the transforming gene of a mouse sarcoma virus has been determined. It codes for a protein of 374 amino acids. The nucleotide sequence of the junctions between a murine leukaemia virus and cellular sequences leading to the formation of the viral transforming gene have also been elucidated. The viral transforming sequence and its cellular homologue share an uninterrupted stretch of 1,159 nucleotides, with few base substitutions. The predicted amino acid sequence of the mouse sarcoma virus transforming gene was found to share considerable homology with the proposed amino acid sequence of the avian sarcoma virus oncogene (src) product.
The retroviral transmembrane envelope protein p15E is immunosuppressive in that it inhibits immune responses of lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. A region of p15E has been conserved among murine and feline retroviruses; a homologous region is also found in the transmembrane envelope proteins of the human retroviruses HTLV-I and HTLV-II and in a putative envelope protein encoded by an endogenous C-type human retroviral DNA. A peptide (CKS-17) was synthesized to correspond to this region of homology and was examined for its effects on lymphocyte proliferation. CKS-17 inhibited the proliferation of an interleukin-2-dependent murine cytotoxic T-cell line as well as alloantigen-stimulated proliferation of murine and human lymphocytes. Four other peptides, representing different regions of virus proteins, were inactive. These results suggest that the immunosuppressive portion of retroviral transmembrane envelope proteins may reside, at least in part, in a-conserved sequence represented by the CKS-17 peptide.
Glycoprotein G of the vesicular stomatitis virus triggers membrane fusion via a low pH-induced structural rearrangement. Despite the equilibrium between the pre- and postfusion states, the structure of the prefusion form, determined to 3.0 angstrom resolution, shows that the fusogenic transition entails an extensive structural reorganization of G. Comparison with the structure of the postfusion form suggests a pathway for the conformational change. In the prefusion form, G has the shape of a tripod with the fusion loops exposed, which point toward the viral membrane, and with the antigenic sites located at the distal end of the molecule. A large number of G glycoproteins, perhaps organized as in the crystals, act cooperatively to induce membrane merging.
It has recently been established that both acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections are accompanied by a dramatic and selective loss of memory CD4+ T cells predominantly from the mucosal surfaces. The mechanism underlying this depletion of memory CD4+ T cells (that is, T-helper cells specific to previously encountered pathogens) has not been defined. Using highly sensitive, quantitative polymerase chain reaction together with precise sorting of different subsets of CD4+ T cells in various tissues, we show that this loss is explained by a massive infection of memory CD4+ T cells by the virus. Specifically, 30-60% of CD4+ memory T cells throughout the body are infected by SIV at the peak of infection, and most of these infected cells disappear within four days. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the depletion of memory CD4+ T cells occurs to a similar extent in all tissues. As a consequence, over one-half of all memory CD4+ T cells in SIV-infected macaques are destroyed directly by viral infection during the acute phase-an insult that certainly heralds subsequent immunodeficiency. Our findings point to the importance of reducing the cell-associated viral load during acute infection through therapeutic or vaccination strategies.
Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is the aetiological agent of AIDS. The virus establishes lytic, latent and non-cytopathic productive infection in cells in culture. The complexity of virus-host cell interaction is reflected in the complex organization of the viral genome. In addition to the genes that encode the virion capsid and envelope proteins and the enzymes required for proviral synthesis and integration common to all retroviruses, HIV-1 is known to encode at least four additional proteins that regulate virus replication, the tat, art, sor and 3' orf proteins, as well as a protein of unknown function from the open reading frame called R. Close examination of the nucleic acid sequences of the genomes of multiple HIV isolates raised the possibility that the virus encodes a previously undetected additional protein. Here we report that HIV-1 encodes a ninth protein and that antibodies to this protein are detected in the sera of people infected with HIV-1. This protein distinguishes HIV-1 isolates from the other human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-2 and SIV) that do not have the capacity to encode a similar protein.
The transcription factor p53 (also known as TP53) guards against tumour and virus replication and is inactivated in almost all cancers. p53-activated transcription of target genes is thought to be synonymous with the stabilization of p53 in response to oncogenes and DNA damage. During adenovirus replication, the degradation of p53 by E1B-55k is considered essential for p53 inactivation, and is the basis for p53-selective viral cancer therapies. Here we reveal a dominant epigenetic mechanism that silences p53-activated transcription, irrespective of p53 phosphorylation and stabilization. We show that another adenoviral protein, E4-ORF3, inactivates p53 independently of E1B-55k by forming a nuclear structure that induces de novo H3K9me3 heterochromatin formation at p53 target promoters, preventing p53-DNA binding. This suppressive nuclear web is highly selective in silencing p53 promoters and operates in the backdrop of global transcriptional changes that drive oncogenic replication. These findings are important for understanding how high levels of wild-type p53 might also be inactivated in cancer as well as the mechanisms that induce aberrant epigenetic silencing of tumour-suppressor loci. Our study changes the longstanding definition of how p53 is inactivated in adenovirus infection and provides key insights that could enable the development of true p53-selective oncolytic viral therapies.
A specific protein of molecular weight (MW) approximately 55,000 (55K) was found recently by immunoprecipitation in all SV40 virus-transformed mammalian cells, in addition to the SV40 large T antigen (appoximately 94K) and small antigen (approximately 17K), which are the only proteins coded by the 'early half' of the SV40 genome. The 55K protein is encoded by cellular DNA; its peptide pattern is different from that of the SV40 antigens and it is species specific in mouse, rat, hamster, monkey and human SV40-transformed (or infected) cells. A 55K protein with a similar peptide pattern was found in mouse embryonal carcinoma cells not exposed to SV40. Similar proteins were reported in mouse sarcomas and leukaemias induced by a great variety of aetiological agents and also in a spontaneously transformed mouse fibroblast cell line, and it has been suggested that the protein may be a general correlated of cellular tumorigenicity. We now report that the approximately 55K protein is present in primary cell cultures from 12-14 day old mouse embryos, but not in 16-day old mouse embryos. The embryo protein has a peptide pattern virtually indistinguishable from that of the SV40-induced protein. We also show by comparing closely related cell families that spontaneously transformed highly tumorigenic mouse cells do not possess the 55K protein.
Similarly to other mammalian and avian retroviruses that lack a transforming gene, moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoMuLV) causes no morphological transformation in infected tissue culture cells. However, following injection in an appropriate animal host, MoMuLV induces mainly thymic lymphomas after a long latency period. A common characteristic of neoplasms induced by retroviruses lacking transforming genes is their clonal origin. Here we have generated MoMuLV-induced rat thymic lymphomas and confirmed their clonal nature. Furthermore, we took advantage of the clonality of these tumours to investigate the specificity of provirus integration in the tumour DNA. We reasoned that if several independently derived thymic lymphomas would contain the provirus integrated in the same region of cellular DNA, this would be a strong indication that this integration event is a contributing factor in oncogenesis. The results indicate that there is indeed a cellular DNA region (termed the MLVI-1 locus) that serves as the substrate for proviral DNA integration in 5 out of 16 tumours we examined.
First brought to scientific attention as infectious cancer-causing agents nearly 80 years ago, retroviruses are popular in contemporary biology for many reasons. (i) The virus life cycle includes several events--in particular, reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome into DNA, orderly integration of viral DNA into host chromosomes, and utilization of host mechanisms for gene expression in response to viral signals--which are broadly informative about eukaryotic cells and viruses. (ii) Retroviral oncogenesis usually depends on transduction or insertional activation of cellular genes, and isolation of those genes has provided the scientific community with many of the molecular components now implicated in the control of normal growth and in human cancer. (iii) Retroviruses include many important veterinary pathogens and two recently discovered human pathogens, the causative agents of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma. (iv) Retroviruses are genetic vectors in nature and can be modified to serve as genetic vectors for both experimental and therapeutic purposes. (v) Insertion of retroviral DNA into host chromosomes can be used to mark cell lineages and to make developmental mutants. Progress in these and other areas of retrovirus-related biology has been enormous during the past two decades, but many practical and theoretical problems remain to be solved.
Earlier this summer, two dozen scientists gathered here to take another crack at the question of viral origins and evolution. Fresh evidence that viruses have existed for billions of years suggests that they were on hand when the first cells arose. That has scientists wondering what role these stripped-down microbes played in the evolution of life.
Based on precedents from other retroviruses, the precursor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase is predicted to be a polyprotein with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 160,000 (160K) encoded by both the viral pol gene and the upstream gag gene. These two genes lie in different translational reading frames, with the 3' end of gag overlapping the 5' end of pol by 205 or 241 nucleotides. Thus, production of the gag-pol fusion protein would require either messenger RNA processing or translational frameshifting. The latter mechanism has been shown in the synthesis of the gag-pol proteins of two other retroviruses, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV). Here we report that translation of HIV-1 RNA synthesized in vitro by SP6 RNA polymerase yields significant amounts of a gag-pol fusion protein, indicating that efficient ribosomal frameshifting also occurs within the HIV-1 gag-pol overlap region. Site-directed mutagenesis and amino-acid sequencing localized the site of frameshifting to a UUA leucine codon near the 5' end of the overlap.
Six baboons (Papio cynocephalus) were intravenously inoculated with the human immunodeficiency virus-type 2 (HIV-2) strain HIV-2UC2. All seroconverted within 6 weeks after inoculation; five animals became persistently infected. Four developed lymphadenopathy, and three of the animals had CD4+ T cell loss within 18 to 24 months after inoculation. One of these baboons, showing severe clinical symptoms, showed at necropsy widespread dissemination of virus with follicular depletion in the lymph nodes, extensive fibromatosis involving lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. Another animal is cachectic and exhibited lymphoid follicular lysis and fibrous skin lesions. Other baboons inoculated with a second strain, HIV-2UC14, have shown evidence of persistent infection. HIV-2 infection of baboons provides a valuable animal model for studying HIV persistence and pathogenesis and for evaluating approaches to antiviral therapies.
RNA viruses infect marine organisms from bacteria to whales, but RNA virus communities in the sea remain essentially unknown. Reverse-transcribed whole-genome shotgun sequencing was used to characterize the diversity of uncultivated marine RNA virus assemblages. A diverse assemblage of RNA viruses, including a broad group of marine picorna-like viruses, and distant relatives of viruses infecting arthropods and higher plants were found. Communities were dominated by distinct genotypes with small genome sizes, and we completely assembled the genomes of several hitherto undiscovered viruses. Our results show that the oceans are a reservoir of previously unknown RNA viruses.
Dysregulation of apoptosis can result in inappropriate suppression of cell death, as occurs in the development of some cancers, or in failure to control the extent of cell death, as is believed to occur in acquired immunodeficiency and certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Recently, we isolated a candidate gene, encoding neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (NAIP), for SMA. This gene is homologous to two baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (Cp-IAP and Op-IAP) and is partly deleted in individuals with type I SMA. A second SMA candidate gene encoding survival motor neuron (SMN), which is contiguous with the NAIP locus on 5q13.1, was also reported. Here we demonstrate a NAIP-mediated inhibition of apoptosis induced by a variety of signals, and have identified three additional human complementary DNAs and a Drosophila melanogaster sequence that are also homologous to the baculovirus IAPs. The four open reading frames (ORFs) possess three baculoviral inhibition of apoptosis protein repeat (BIR) domains and a carboxy-terminal RING zinc-finger. The human iap genes have a distinct but overlapping pattern of expression in fetal and adult tissues. These proteins significantly increase the number of known apoptotic suppressors.
Early treatment of acute HIV-1 infection followed by treatment interruptions has shown promise for enhancing immune control of infection. A subsequent loss of control, however, allows the correlates of protective immunity to be assessed. Here we show that sudden breakthrough of plasma viraemia occurred after prolonged immune containment in an individual infected with HIV-1 at a time when 25 distinct CD8+ T-cell epitopes in the viral proteins Gag, RT, Integrase, Env, Nef, Vpr, Vif and Rev were being targeted. Sequencing of the virus in plasma and cells showed that superinfection with a second clade-B virus was coincident with the loss of immune control. This sudden increase in viraemia was associated with a decline in half of the CD8+ T-cell responses. The declining CD8+ T-cell responses were coupled with sequence changes relative to the initial virus that resulted in impaired recognition. Our data show that HIV-1 superinfection can occur in the setting of a strong and broadly directed virus-specific CD8+ T-cell response. The lack of cross-protective immunity for closely related HIV-1 strains, despite persistent recognition of multiple CD8 epitopes, has important implications for public health and vaccine development.
Many chemical carcinogens or their metabolites react with DNA; thus it is of interest to determine what effect chromosomal structure has on these reactions. The chromosome of simian virus 40 (SV40) is well suited for such studies; like chromatin of eukaryotic cells, it is organized into nucleosomes. The nucleotide sequence of SV40 is known, together with much about the pattern of viral gene expression and DNA replication, and the structure of the viral chromosome. We have investigated the binding of the ultimate carcinogen, N-acetoxy-acetylaminofluorene (AAAF), to specific regions of the SV40 chromosome in situ in the intact infected cell. The results, reported here, indicate that a region containing regulatory functions on the intracellular SV40 chromosome has unique structural properties which render it more susceptible to attack by AAAF than the rest of the SV40 genome. The preferential binding of AAAF to regulatory regions of chromatin may have implications for the mechanism of action of this and similar carcinogens.
Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) can induce dementia with alarming occurrence worldwide. The mechanism remains poorly understood, but discovery in brain of HIV-1-binding sites (chemokine receptors) provides new insights. HIV-1 infects macrophages and microglia, but not neurons, although neurons are injured and die by apoptosis. The predominant pathway to neuronal injury is indirect through release of macrophage, microglial and astrocyte toxins, although direct injury by viral proteins might also contribute. These toxins overstimulate neurons, resulting in the formation of free radicals and excitotoxicity, similar to other neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advances in understanding the signalling pathways mediating these events offer hope for therapeutic intervention.
Increasingly complex networks of small RNAs act through RNA-interference (RNAi) pathways to regulate gene expression, to mediate antiviral responses, to organize chromosomal domains, and to restrain the spread of selfish genetic elements. Historically, RNAi has been defined as a response to double-stranded RNA. However, some small RNA species may not arise from double-stranded RNA precursors. Yet, like microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, such species guide Argonaute proteins to silencing targets through complementary base-pairing. Silencing can be achieved by corecruitment of accessory factors or through the activity of Argonaute itself, which often has endonucleolytic activity. As a specific and adaptive regulatory system, RNAi is used throughout eukarya, which indicates a long evolutionary history. A likely function of RNAi throughout that history is to protect the genome from both pathogenic and parasitic invaders.
For a wide variety of microbial pathogens, the outcome of the infection is indeterminate. In some individuals the microbe is cleared, but in others it establishes a chronic infection, and the factors that tip this balance are often unknown. In a widely used model of chronic viral infection, C57BL/6 mice clear the Armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), but the clone 13 strain persists. Here we show that the Armstrong strain induces a profound lymphopenia at days 1-3 after infection, but the clone 13 strain does not. If we transiently augment lymphopenia by treating the clone-13-infected mice with the drug FTY720 at days 0-2 after infection, the mice successfully clear the infection by day 30. Clearance does not occur when CD4 T cells are absent at the time of treatment, indicating that the drug is not exerting direct antiviral effects. Notably, FTY720 treatment of an already established persistent infection also leads to viral clearance. In both models, FTY720 treatment preserves or augments LCMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, a result that is counter-intuitive because FTY720 is generally regarded as a new immunosuppressive agent. Because FTY720 targets host pathways that are completely evolutionarily conserved, our results may be translatable into new immunotherapies for the treatment of chronic microbial infections in humans.
Naturally occurring oncoviruses of several species are transmitted contagiously and cause lymphosarcoma (LSA) or leukaemia in their hosts. All naturally occurring oncoviruses replicate in vivo in the tumours they induce or, as with bovine leukaemia virus, can be isolated from tumour cells grown in short-term cell culture. However, we have shown that feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is not present in a significant minority of pet cats that develop LSA. Unlike experimentally induced virus-negative leukaemias and sarcomas of other species, LSA cells from FeLV-negative LSA cats lack any FeLV proteins, including p15 or p12, and complete functional copies of FeLV provirus and thus do not produce FeLV when grown in cell culture. Thus, except for FeLV, the naturally occurring animal leukaemogenic oncoviruses seem to induce only virus-producing lymphoid tumours. Our earlier findings prompted a study to determine the frequency of occurrence of FeLV non-producer (NP) LSA in pet cats and whether NP LSAs develop in cats exposed to FeLV. We report here epidemiological data which indicate that development of NP LSAs in pet cats is associated with exposure to FeLV and suggest that FeLV may be the aetiological agent for FeLV NP feline LSAs. Thus, feline NP LSAs may be suitable for studying the potential viral aetiology and mechanism of leukaemogenesis of human lymphoid tumours in which no oncoviruses have, as yet, been proved to cause the disease.
Mobile genetic elements have been identified in several eukaryotic organisms and some classes have been found to share common structural features with the proviral forms of animal retroviruses. The representatives of this class of mobile elements in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are called Ty elements, which could be a useful model system for studying the transposition of retrovirus-like elements. Here we have attempted to answer two questions often raised in discussions of the biological importance of transposition: what is the frequency of spontaneous Ty transposition, and are there certain chromosomal regions into which Ty elements preferentially integrate? We chose the LYS2 gene to investigate these questions because it allows direct selection of both mutants and revertants. We have found that 2% of spontaneous lys2 mutants are caused by Ty transposition with a preferential integration into the transcription initiation region.
The haemagglutinin glycoprotein HA of influenza viruses is responsible for the attachment of the virus to neuraminic acid-containing receptors at the cell surface and subsequent penetration by triggering fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. To express full activity of the newly synthesized precursor, HA has to be modified by post-translational proteolytic cleavage into the polypeptides HA1 and HA2 by cellular enzymes. If proteases suitable for cleavage are not present in the host cell, the resulting virus particles are non-infectious. During adaptation of the apathogenic influenza virus A/turkey/Oregon/71 to chicken embryo cells, which are not permissive for HA cleavage, we obtained an infectious virus variant with increased pathogenicity. Sequence analysis revealed that during adaptation 54 nucleotides were inserted into the HA gene; their sequence corresponds to a region of the 28S ribosomal RNA. This insertion is probably responsible for increased cleavability of HA, as well as for infectivity and pathogenicity of the adapted virus.
Specific B lymphocytes can act as very efficient antigen-presenting cells. They bind antigen with high affinity via their immunoglobulin receptors, process it through the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) pathway, and present its fragments to class II-restricted T lymphocytes. In general, exogenous antigens and noninfectious viral particles enter the class II pathway and are selectively associated with class II MHC molecules. The presentation of an exogenous antigen in association with class I molecules has been reported for only a few antigens, including the hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBenvAg). Here we demonstrate that antigen-specific B cells can efficiently deliver HBenvAg to the class I pathway, presenting its fragments to class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) which kill the specific B cells. This could represent a mechanism of suppression of neutralizing anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody response, a phenomenon that accompanies the development of the chronic HBV-carrier state.
The gene coding for the circumsporozoite antigen of the malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi was inserted into the vaccinia virus genome under the control of a defined vaccinia virus promoter. Cells infected with the recombinant virus synthesized polypeptides of 53,000 to 56,000 daltons that reacted with monoclonal antibody against the repeating epitope of the malaria protein. Furthermore, rabbits vaccinated with the recombinant virus produced antibodies that bound specifically to sporozoites. These data provide evidence for expression of a cloned malaria gene in mammalian cells and illustrate the potential of vaccinia virus recombinants as live malaria vaccines.
The early events in viral dissemination via the bloodstream were identified by monitoring the fate of 123I-radiolabeled reovirus after it was injected intravenously in rats. Continuous scintillation camera imaging showed that reovirus serotypes 1 and 3 were cleared from the circulation in less than 10 minutes by specific and distinct target organs. Reovirus serotype 1 accumulated predominantly in the lungs and the liver, whereas serotype 3 accumulated in the liver and the spleen with very little virus uptake by the lungs. Incubation of reovirus serotype 1 with a monoclonal antibody directed against the viral hemagglutinin before injection totally inhibited the clearance of the virus by the lungs. Similar results were obtained when viruses biolabeled with 35S were used. These results demonstrate that viruses can be rapidly transported through the bloodstream to specific target organs and that the localization of the viruses depends on the interaction between specific viral surface components and the target organ.
The extreme polymorphism in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I region of the human genome is suggested to provide an advantage in pathogen defence mediated by CD8+ T cells. HLA class I molecules present pathogen-derived peptides on the surface of infected cells for recognition by CD8+ T cells. However, the relative contributions of HLA-A and -B alleles have not been evaluated. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the class I restricted CD8+ T-cell responses against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), immune control of which is dependent upon virus-specific CD8+ T-cell activity. In 375 HIV-1-infected study subjects from southern Africa, a significantly greater number of CD8+ T-cell responses are HLA-B-restricted, compared to HLA-A (2.5-fold; P = 0.0033). Here we show that variation in viral set-point, in absolute CD4 count and, by inference, in rate of disease progression in the cohort, is strongly associated with particular HLA-B but not HLA-A allele expression (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.91, respectively). Moreover, substantially greater selection pressure is imposed on HIV-1 by HLA-B alleles than by HLA-A (4.4-fold, P = 0.0003). These data indicate that the principal focus of HIV-specific activity is at the HLA-B locus. Furthermore, HLA-B gene frequencies in the population are those likely to be most influenced by HIV disease, consistent with the observation that B alleles evolve more rapidly than A alleles. The dominant involvement of HLA-B in influencing HIV disease outcome is of specific relevance to the direction of HIV research and to vaccine design.
We recently reported the isolation and characterization of a novel human T-lymphotropic retrovirus, HTLV-III, in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and in those at risk for the disease. After extensive sero-epidemiological studies, together with numerous virus isolations from these patients, we concluded that HTLV-III is the causative agent of AIDS. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of two highly related but distinct forms of the HTLV-III genome. The viral genome is approximately 10 kilobases long and is detected in HTLV-III-infected cells but not in uninfected cells, including normal human tissue, indicating that this virus is exogenous to man. We also demonstrate distant nucleic acid sequence homology between the cloned genome of HTLV-III and those of HTLV-I and HTLV-II. The availability of the cloned HTLV-III genome will now allow an unambiguous comparison of this virus with other retroviruses that also have been associated with the pathogenesis of AIDS, and moreover, with facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic measures in the treatment of AIDS.
The mechanisms underlying induction and suppression of RNA silencing in the ongoing plant-virus arms race are poorly understood. We show here that virus-derived small RNAs produced by Arabidopsis Dicer-like 4 (DCL4) program an effector complex conferring antiviral immunity. Inhibition of DCL4 by a viral-encoded suppressor revealed the subordinate antiviral activity of DCL2. Accordingly, inactivating both DCL2 and DCL4 was necessary and sufficient to restore systemic infection of a suppressor-deficient virus. The effects of DCL2 were overcome by increasing viral dosage in inoculated leaves, but this could not surmount additional, non-cell autonomous effects of DCL4 specifically preventing viral unloading from the vasculature. These findings define a molecular framework for studying antiviral silencing and defense in plants.
The single endogenous DBA/2J ectropic provirus segregated concordantly with the dilute (d) coat colour mutation on chromosome 9 in 53/53 DBA/2J-derived recombinant inbred mouse strains and all seven inbred and mutant strains tested that carry the d allele. Analysis of DNA from a spontaneous DBA/2J d revertant (d+2J) showed that these mice lack ecotropic-specific MuLV DNA sequences and suggested that the dilute mutation resulted from integration of an ecotropic provirus into the mouse genome.
Monkeypox mutants arising spontaneously or after serial, high multiplicity passage were characterized phenotypically and by restriction endonuclease mapping. Some resemble "whitepox" and variola viruses in several of the markers tested but all are distinguishable phenotypically from these. None resembles "whitepox" viruses in genome structure although near-terminal deletions or symmetrical, terminal rearrangements, relative to parental monkeypox, occurred. "Whitepox" viruses isolated from animals closely resemble variola in both phenotype and genome structure.
Interferon was originally described as an antiviral agent produced shortly after onset of infection with most viruses. However, in addition to inducing an antiviral state, interferon inhibits cell division, increases the expression of cell-surface antigens, boosts the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and modulates several immune functions of lymphocytes and macrophages. Moreover, a special class of interferon (immune interferon or IFN-gamma) is produced by T cells following stimulation with antigen or interaction with mitogens. The different methods by which interferon is induced and its multiple effects suggest that it may be part of a first-line defence system controlling the spread of virus infections and the proliferation of modified 'self' cells that have been affected by virus infection or neoplastic transformation. The ability of certain human lymphoma cells to activate the alternative pathway of complement is well established. Here we show that monoclonal antibody-purified interferon can amplify the ability of certain tumour cells to activate complement via the alternative pathway. This demonstration may reflect an additional, as yet unknown, role of interferon in inducing non-specific anti-tumour immunity.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), in contrast with most other retroviruses, encodes trans-regulatory proteins for virus gene expression. It is shown in this study, by means of an in vitro splicing system, that nuclear extracts obtained from cells infected with HIV-1 contain a factor (or factors) that specifically inhibits splicing of a synthetic SP6/HIV pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA)-containing donor and acceptor splice sites in the coding region for the envelope protein. It is also shown that the SP6/HIV pre-mRNA is not capable of assembly in a ribonucleoprotein complex, spliceosome, in extracts from infected cells. These findings raise the possibility that specific inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing in the envelope protein coding region by HIV-1 trans-regulatory factors might be one control mechanism for efficient production of structural viral proteins and virion assembly.
Poliovirus mutants resistant to neutralization with soluble cellular receptor were isolated. Replication of soluble receptor-resistant (srr) mutants was blocked by a monoclonal antibody directed against the HeLa cell receptor for poliovirus, indicating that the mutants use this receptor to enter cells. The srr mutants showed reduced binding to HeLa cells and cell membranes. However, the reduced binding phenotype did not have a major impact on viral replication, as judged by plaque size and one-step growth curves. These results suggest that the use of soluble receptors as antiviral agents could lead to the selection of neutralization-resistant mutants that are able to bind cell surface receptors, replicate, and cause disease.
Experiments with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ("replicase") purified from Escherichia coli infected with an RNA bacteriophage (Qbeta) demonstrate that the enzyme generates a polynucleotide of the same molecular weight as viral RNA; the "replicase" cannot distinguish the polynucleotide from its own RNA genome. By starting reactions at input ratios below the saturation levels of template to enzyme, autocatalytic kinetics of RNA increase are observed. The data are consistent with the conclusion that self-propagation of complete viral genomes is occurring in this simple system.
The "operon' theory of gene regulation, in which protein repressor molecules bind to the operator site of a gene to prevent its transcription, is now well established. Recently, however, cases have been discovered in which gene expression is regulated by complementary RNA molecules that are able to bind to the transcripts of particular genes and consequently prevent their translation. For example, the synthesis of OmpF protein (a major outer membrane protein) in Escherichia coli is regulated by a short RNA complementary to a region of ompF RNA encompassing the "Shine-Dalgarno' sequence and the translation initiation codon. This RNA has been termed micRNA (messenger-RNA-interfering complementary RNA), and its discovery has prompted us to construct an artificial micRNA system designed to regulate gene expression in E. coli. A given target gene can be repressed by artificially producing an RNA (micRNA) complementary to the mRNA encoded by that gene. A micRNA system has also been used successfully in tissue-cultured mammalian cells. The use of artificial micRNAs to specifically regulate individual genes has great potential as a novel cellular immune system for blocking bacteriophage or virus infection. Here, we report that on induction of micRNAs directed against the coat protein and/or the replicase of the E. coli bacteriophage SP, phage proliferation was effectively prevented. We propose that the micRNA immune system provides an effective means of preventing viral infection as well as the expression of harmful genes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
A major role of the classical transplantation antigens (designated class I antigens) is the presentation of virus-infected cells to cytotoxic T cells, a process that leads to the destruction of the cell displaying the viral antigen. Consistent with this function is the finding that these transplantation antigens (encoded by the H-2K, H-2D and H-2L genes in mice) are cell-surface glycoproteins with their amino-termini protruding extracellularly and their carboxy-termini located inside the cell. While the external domain is expected to provide biological specificity required for the associative presentation of viral antigens, the role of the cytoplasmic domain remains obscure. The recent observation that this latter region of the molecule is encoded by three separate DNA exons has suggested a complex role for this portion of the polypeptide chain. We have now obtained evidence for the use of alternative acceptor splice sites in the H-2K gene, resulting in two RNA transcripts that would encode H-2K antigens differing in their carboxy-termini. This is the first demonstration of the use of alternative splice acceptor sites in the same class I gene, and indicates the existence of different functional subsets of antigens encoded by the same gene.
Many mammalian viruses have acquired genes from their hosts during their evolution. The rationale for these acquisitions is usually quite clear: the captured genes are subverted to provide a selective advantage to the virus. Here we describe the opposite situation, where a viral gene has been sequestered to serve an important function in the physiology of a mammalian host. This gene, encoding a protein that we have called syncytin, is the envelope gene of a recently identified human endogenous defective retrovirus, HERV-W. We find that the major sites of syncytin expression are placental syncytiotrophoblasts, multinucleated cells that originate from fetal trophoblasts. We show that expression of recombinant syncytin in a wide variety of cell types induces the formation of giant syncytia, and that fusion of a human trophoblastic cell line expressing endogenous syncytin can be inhibited by an anti-syncytin antiserum. Our data indicate that syncytin may mediate placental cytotrophoblast fusion in vivo, and thus may be important in human placental morphogenesis.
Transformation of cells by herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) can be induced by the BglII C (0.43-0.58 map units) or N (0.58-0.625) fragments of the viral genome. Sequences partially overlapping both fragments (0.566-0.602) encode two 3' coterminal mRNAs; these in turn direct the synthesis of two related polypeptides of molecular weight 140,000 (140K) and 35K (refs 4, 7), which may be involved in transformation. Recently, a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation affecting HSV-induced ribonucleotide reductase has been mapped within this common region (B.M. Dutia, personal communication). We have partially purified the induced reductase and raised a rabbit antiserum to it which inhibits the enzyme activity and immunoprecipitates from infected cells a 144K polypeptide and minor species including a 38K polypeptide. Here we show that a monoclonal antibody to the putative transforming proteins competes with the rabbit serum for the 144K and 38K antigens and also immunoprecipitates specifically the induced reductase activity. These results suggest a possible role for ribonucleotide reductase in HSV-2-induced transformation.
Mammalian C-type retroviruses are inactivated by human serum, following triggering of the classical complement cascade. This may have inhibited transmission to humans of C-type oncoviruses from other mammals. Indeed, the retroviruses human immunodeficiency virus and human T-cell leukaemia virus are resistant to human complement. Antibody-independent activation of human C1q, the first component of the classical pathway, by retroviral envelope proteins has been described. However, retroviruses produced from human cells are resistant to inactivation by human complement and human serum is known to contain antibodies directed against carbohydrates on retroviral envelopes. Gal(alpha 1-3)Gal terminal carbohydrates are expressed by most mammals but are absent in humans, which lack a functional (alpha 1-3)galactosyltransferase gene. Here, we demonstrate that anti-Gal(alpha 1-3)Gal antibodies in human serum inactivate retroviruses produced from animal cells. Expression of porcine (alpha 1-3)galactosyltransferase in human cells renders the cells and the retroviruses they produce sensitive to human serum.
The gene designated gamma 134.5 maps in the inverted repeats flanking the long unique sequence of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) DNA, and therefore it is present in two copies per genome. This gene is not essential for viral growth in cell culture. Four recombinant viruses were genetically engineered to test the function of this gene. These were (i) a virus from which both copies of the gene were deleted, (ii) a virus containing a stop codon in both copies of the gene, (iii) a virus containing after the first codon an insert encoding a 16-amino acid epitope known to react with a specific monoclonal antibody, and (iv) a virus in which the deleted sequences were restored. The viruses from which the gene was deleted or which carried stop codons were avirulent on intracerebral inoculation of mice. The virus with the gene tagged by the sequence encoding the epitope was moderately virulent, whereas the restored virus reacquired the phenotype of the parent virus. Significant amounts of virus were recovered only from brains of animals inoculated with virulent viruses. Inasmuch as the product of the gamma 134.5 gene extended the host range of the virus by enabling it to replicate and destroy brain cells, it is a viral neurovirulence factor.
The vesicular stomatitis virus has an atypical membrane fusion glycoprotein (G) exhibiting a pH-dependent equilibrium between two forms at the virus surface. Membrane fusion is triggered during the transition from the high- to low-pH form. The structure of G in its low-pH form shows the classic hairpin conformation observed in all other fusion proteins in their postfusion conformation, in spite of a novel fold combining features of fusion proteins from classes I and II. The structure provides a framework for understanding the reversibility of the G conformational change. Unexpectedly, G is homologous to gB of herpesviruses, which raises important questions on viral evolution.
Mycosis fungoides, a rare form of cutaneous T cell leukemia/lymphoma, is suspected of having a viral etiology on the basis of certain similarities to adult T cell leukemia, which is associated with human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. Cell lines were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of an HTLV-I-seronegative patient with mycosis fungoides. DNA hybridization analysis revealed the presence of HTLV-I-related sequences with unusual restriction endonuclease sites. Sequence analysis of subcloned fragments demonstrated the presence of a monoclonally integrated provirus with a 5.5-kilobase deletion involving large regions of gag and env and all of pol. Additional evidence for the presence of deleted proviruses was found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA from cutaneous lesions of five other HTLV-I-seronegative patients. The findings suggest that HTLV-I infection may be involved in the etiology of at least certain cases of mycosis fungoides.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) mediates viral genome attachment to mitotic chromosomes. We find that N-terminal LANA docks onto chromosomes by binding nucleosomes through the folded region of histones H2A-H2B. The same LANA residues were required for both H2A-H2B binding and chromosome association. Further, LANA did not bind Xenopus sperm chromatin, which is deficient in H2A-H2B; chromatin binding was rescued after assembly of nucleosomes containing H2A-H2B. We also describe the 2.9-angstrom crystal structure of a nucleosome complexed with the first 23 LANA amino acids. The LANA peptide forms a hairpin that interacts exclusively with an acidic H2A-H2B region that is implicated in the formation of higher order chromatin structure. Our findings present a paradigm for how nucleosomes may serve as binding platforms for viral and cellular proteins and reveal a previously unknown mechanism for KSHV latency.
The nucleotide sequence of SV40 DNA was determined, and the sequence was correlated with known genes of the virus and with the structure of viral messenger RNA's. There is a limited overlap of the coding regions for structural proteins and a complex pattern of leader sequences at the 5' end of late messenger RNA. The sequence of the early region is consistent with recent proposals that the large early polypeptide of SV40 is encoded in noncontinguous segments of DNA.
Oncogenes discovered in retroviruses such as Rous sarcoma virus were generated by transduction of cellular proto-oncogenes into the viral genome. Several different kinds of junctions between the viral and proto-oncogene sequences have been found in different viruses. A system of retrovirus vectors and a protocol that mimicked this transduction during a single cycle of retrovirus replication was developed. The transduction involved the formation of a chimeric viral-cellular RNA, strand switching of the reverse transcription growing point from an infectious retrovirus to the chimeric RNA, and often a subsequent deletion during the rest of viral DNA synthesis. A short region of sequence identity was frequently used for the strand switching. The rate of this process was about 0.1 to 1 percent of the rate of homologous retroviral recombination.
Adenovirus e1a induces quiescent human cells to replicate. We found that e1a causes global relocalization of the RB (retinoblastoma) proteins (RB, p130, and p107) and p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases on promoters, the effect of which is to restrict the acetylation of histone 3 lysine-18 (H3K18ac) to a limited set of genes, thereby stimulating cell cycling and inhibiting antiviral responses and cellular differentiation. Soon after expression, e1a binds transiently to promoters of cell cycle and growth genes, causing enrichment of p300/CBP, PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor), and H3K18ac; depletion of RB proteins; and transcriptional activation. e1a also associates transiently with promoters of antiviral genes, causing enrichment for RB, p130, and H4K16ac; increased nucleosome density; and transcriptional repression. At later times, e1a and p107 bind mainly to promoters of development and differentiation genes, repressing transcription. The temporal order of e1a binding requires its interactions with p300/CBP and RB proteins. Our data uncover a defined epigenetic reprogramming leading to cellular transformation.
Two evolutionarily distinct families of human retroviruses, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and the human T-cell leukaemia viruses (HTLV), have been defined (reviewed in ref. 1). Although these virus groups share tropism for human CD4+ T cells, they differ markedly in primary sequence, genetic organization and disease association (AIDS versus adult T-cell leukaemia), but show similar general strategies for the regulation of viral gene expression. Each encodes a protein able to trans-activate transcription from the homologous viral long terminal repeat (tat in HIV, tax in HTLV), although these proteins act by different mechanisms and do not appear to be interchangeable. Each virus also produces a second trans-acting protein that induces the expression of the unspliced messenger RNAs encoding the viral structural proteins (rev in HIV and rex in HTLV). Here we show that the rex protein of HTLV-I can functionally replace the rev protein of HIV-1 in transient expression assays. This genetic complementation by rex is adequate for the rescue of a replication-defective rev mutant of HIV-1. This unexpected shared function between the structurally distinct rex and rev proteins emphasizes the importance of this highly conserved pathway for the regulation of human retrovirus gene expression.
The viral RNA isolated from the defective particles of vesicular stomatitis virus was capable of interfering with the replication of this virus in chick embryo cells. The data indicate that the interfering ability of the defective particles of this virus is due to their nucleic acid component.
In eukaryotes, small non-coding RNAs regulate gene expression, helping to control cellular metabolism, growth and differentiation, to maintain genome integrity, and to combat viruses and mobile genetic elements. These pathways involve two specialized ribonucleases that control the production and function of small regulatory RNAs. The enzyme Dicer cleaves double-stranded RNA precursors, generating short interfering RNAs and microRNAs in the cytoplasm. These small RNAs are transferred to Argonaute proteins, which guide the sequence-specific silencing of messenger RNAs that contain complementary sequences by either enzymatically cleaving the mRNA or repressing its translation. The molecular structures of Dicer and the Argonaute proteins, free and bound to small RNAs, have offered exciting insights into the molecular mechanisms that are central to RNA silencing pathways.
The presence of papillomaviruses in epithelial-derived cancers from several animal species has led to the speculation that these viruses may also have a pathogenic role in the development of certain human carcinomas, particularly those associated with the anogenital tract. Recently, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA has been detected in epithelial-derived cancers, both cutaneous and metastatic, from patients exhibiting the rare, chronic flat wart disease, epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). Except for patients exhibiting this chronic wart syndrome, the association of HPV genomes with human epithelial cancers has not been demonstrated. In an attempt to delineate the association and possible involvement of papillomaviruses with human anogenital carcinomas, we have begun an analysis of these cancers for the presence of HPV-specific nucleotide sequences by using highly sensitive hybridization procedures capable of detecting distantly related papillomaviruses at low copy number. Here we demonstrate the presence of HPV DNA in several types of anogenital tumours: Bowenoid papulosis, carcinoma in situ, and verrucous carcinoma. These data indicate that HPV can be detected in several types of premalignant and malignant tumours, supporting the contention that this group of viruses may be involved in the development of certain types of human epithelial-derived cancers.
We report here a study of the mechanisms leading to loss of growth control in chicken embryo fibroblasts transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). We have been particularly concerned with the role of the src gene in this process, and have used RSV mutants temperature sensitive (ts) for transformation to investigate the nature of the growth regulatory lesion. The two principal findings were (1) the stationary phase of the cell cycle (G1) in chick embryo fibroblasts seems to have two distinct regulatory compartments (using the terminology of Brooks et al. we refer to these as 'Q' and 'A' states). When rendered stationary at 41.5 degrees C by serum deprivation, normal cells enter a Q state, but cells infected with the ts-mutant occupy an A state. (2) Whereas normal cells can occupy either state depending on culture conditions, the ts-infected cells, at 41.5 degrees C, do not seem to enter Q even though a known src gene product, a kinase, is reported to be inactive at this temperature. We discuss the possibility that viral factors other than the active src protein kinase influence growth control in infected cultures.
The transforming gene (src) of avian sarcoma virus (ASV) and adjacent regions of the viral genome have been isolated by molelcular cloning of viral DNA. Their nucleotide sequence encompasses the whole of src and the portion of the gene env that encodes gp 37, one of two glycoproteins found in the viral envelope. Src encodes a single, hydrophobic protein with structural features that conform to previous descriptions descriptions of the gene product (pp60src). It appears that a single viral protein is responsible for both the initiation and maintenance of neoplastic transformation by avian sarcoma virus. Neither src nor its product bear any obvious structural relationship to several other viral oncogenes and their encoded proteins. Src is flanked by a repeated nucleotide sequence that may facilitate frequent deletion of the gene from the viral genome.
The antiviral activity of alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) produced by human leukocytes in response to viral infection has been considered to be independent of the virus which induced its production. Recently, however, IFN-alpha has been found to include at least eight different subtypes, as indicated by measurement of antigenic variability, DNA hybridization and amino acid sequencing. We considered the possibility that interferon heterogeneity may play a part in enhancing host antiviral defence and now present data suggesting that purified human macrophages, when exposed to different viruses, produce interferons having differing spectra of antiviral activity. These findings may provide a functional correlation for IFN-alpha heterogeneity.
The mature capsids of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other retroviruses are fullerene shells, composed of the viral CA protein, that enclose the viral genome and facilitate its delivery into new host cells. Retroviral CA proteins contain independently folded amino (N)- and carboxy (C)-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) that are connected by a flexible linker. The NTD forms either hexameric or pentameric rings, whereas the CTD forms symmetric homodimers that connect the rings into a hexagonal lattice. We previously used a disulphide crosslinking strategy to enable isolation and crystallization of soluble HIV-1 CA hexamers. Here we use the same approach to solve the X-ray structure of the HIV-1 CA pentamer at 2.5 A resolution. Two mutant CA proteins with engineered disulphides at different positions (P17C/T19C and N21C/A22C) converged onto the same quaternary structure, indicating that the disulphide-crosslinked proteins recapitulate the structure of the native pentamer. Assembly of the quasi-equivalent hexamers and pentamers requires remarkably subtle rearrangements in subunit interactions, and appears to be controlled by an electrostatic switch that favours hexamers over pentamers. This study completes the gallery of substructures describing the components of the HIV-1 capsid and enables atomic-level modelling of the complete capsid. Rigid-body rotations around two assembly interfaces appear sufficient to generate the full range of continuously varying lattice curvature in the fullerene cone.
The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV (formerly T-cell lymphotropic virus type III, HTLV-III or lymphadenopathy-associated virus, LAV) is the primary cause of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). Patients with AIDS have profound immunosuppression as a result of almost complete absence of the OKT4+ cell population and are predisposed to a number of opportunistic infections as well as to certain malignant diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma and B-cell tumours. The majority of the opportunistic infections observed in AIDS patients are from the herpesvirus group and these are frequently the cause of death in AIDS patients. We have therefore investigated the effect of herpes virus infection on the expression of HIV and we provide evidence that herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-I) can reactivate transcription of latent HIV. In OKT4+ human T-cells HIV replicates to high virus titres, resulting in high level expression of viral RNA. This high level of expression has been attributed to virus-associated trans-acting factors that increase gene expression, directed by the HIV long terminal repeats (LTR), post-transcriptionally. In our studies we have tested whether transcription directed by the LTR of HIV is stimulated by HSV-I.
The interface between an infectious agent and its host represents the ultimate battleground for survival: The microbe must secure a niche for replication, whereas the host must limit the pathogen's advance. Among the host's arsenal of antimicrobial factors, the type 1 interferons (IFNs) induce potent defense mechanisms against viruses and are key in the host-virus standoff. Viruses have evolved multiple tricks to avoid the immediate antiviral effects of IFNs and, in turn, hosts have adapted use of this innate cytokine system to galvanize multiple additional layers of immune defense. The plasticity that exists in these interactions provides us with a lesson in detente.
Hundreds of murine dilute mutations have been identified and analysed, making dilute one of the best genetically characterized of all mammalian loci. The recessive dilute (d) coat colour mutation carried by many inbred strains of mice produces a lightening of coat colour, caused by an abnormal adendritic melanocyte morphology that results in an uneven release of pigment granules into the developing hair shaft. Most dilute alleles (dilute-lethal) also produce a neurological defect, characterized by convulsions and opisthotonus, apparent at 8-10 days of age and continuing until the death of the animal at 2-3 weeks of age. The discovery that the original dilute allele (now termed dilute-viral or dV) is the result of the integration of an ecotropic murine leukaemia provirus has allowed the cloning of genomic DNA and in this study complementary DNA, from the dilute locus. The predicted dilute amino-acid sequence indicates that dilute encodes a novel type of myosin heavy chain, with a tail, or C-terminal, region that has elements of both type II (alpha-helical coiled-coil) and type I (non-coiled-coil) myosin heavy chains. Dilute transcripts are differentially expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues and are very abundant in neurons of the central nervous system, cephalic ganglia, and spinal ganglia. These results suggest an important role for the dilute gene product in the elaboration, maintenance, or function of cellular processes of melanocytes and neurons.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) enter target cells by forming a complex between the viral envelope protein and two cell-surface membrane receptors: CD4 and a 7-span transmembrane chemokine receptor. Isolates of HIV that differ in cellular tropism use different subsets of chemokine receptors as entry cofactors: macrophage-tropic HIVs primarily use CCR5, whereas T-cell-tropic and dual-tropic isolates use CXCR4 receptors. HIV-mediated signal transduction through CCR5 is not required for efficient fusion and entry of HIV in vitro. Here we show that recombinant envelope proteins from macrophage-tropic HIV and SIV induce a signal through CCR5 on CD4+ T cells and that envelope-mediated signal transduction through CCR5 induces chemotaxis of T cells. This chemotactic response may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV in vivo by chemo-attracting activated CD4+ cells to sites of viral replication. HIV-mediated signalling through CCR5 may also enhance viral replication in vivo by increasing the activation state of target cells. Alternatively, envelope-mediated CCR5 signal transduction may influence viral-associated cytopathicity or apoptosis.
The initial event in the infection of human T lymphocytes, macrophages, and other cells by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is the attachment of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 to its cellular receptor, CD4. As a step toward designing antagonists of this binding event, soluble, secreted forms of CD4 were produced by transfection of mammalian cells with vectors encoding versions of CD4 lacking its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The soluble CD4 so produced binds gp120 with an affinity and specificity comparable to intact CD4 and is capable of neutralizing the infectivity of HIV-1. These studies reveal that the high-affinity CD4-gp120 interaction does not require other cell or viral components and may establish a novel basis for therapeutic intervention in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
A synthetic peptidemimetic substrate of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease with a nonhydrolyzable pseudodipeptidyl insert at the protease cleavage site was prepared. The peptide U-81749 inhibited recombinant HIV-1 protease in vitro (inhibition constant Ki of 70 nanomolar) and HIV-1 replication in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (inhibitory concentration IC50 of 0.1 to 1 micromolar). Moreover, 10 micromolar concentrations of U-81749 significantly inhibited proteolysis of the HIV-1 gag polyprotein (p55) to the mature viral structural proteins p24 and p17 in cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HIV-1 gag-pol genes. The HIV-1 like particles released from inhibitor-treated cells contained almost exclusively p55 and other gag precursors, but not p24. Incubation of HIV-like particles recovered from drug-treated cultures in drug-free medium indicated that inhibition of p55 proteolysis was at least partially reversible, suggesting that U-81749 was present within the particles.
In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, functional defects and deletion of antigen-reactive T cells are more frequent than can be explained by direct viral infection. On culturing, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals died as a result of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Apoptosis was enhanced by activation with CD3 antibodies. Programmed cell death, associated with impaired T cell reactivity, may thus be responsible for the deletion of reactive T cells that contributes to HIV-induced immunodeficiency.
The reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) catalyzes a series of reactions to convert single-stranded viral RNA into double-stranded DNA for host cell integration. This process requires a variety of enzymatic activities, including DNA polymerization, RNA cleavage, strand transfer, and strand displacement synthesis. We used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to probe the interactions between RT and nucleic acid substrates in real time. RT was observed to slide on nucleic acid duplexes, rapidly shuttling between opposite termini of the duplex. Upon reaching the DNA 3' terminus, RT can spontaneously flip into a polymerization orientation. Sliding kinetics were regulated by cognate nucleotides and anti-HIV drugs, which stabilized and destabilized the polymerization mode, respectively. These long-range translocation activities facilitate multiple stages of the reverse transcription pathway, including normal DNA polymerization and strand displacement synthesis.
Herpesvirus hominis was isolated from the trigeminal ganglion obtained at autopsy from 1 of 22 patients with no clinical evidence of active herpetic disease, and from one patient with malignant lymphoma who died with herpes zoster on the abdomen, pulmonary cytomegalic inclusion disease, and possible oral herpes simplex. Virus was isolated by cocultivation of explants of ganglion with monolayers of Vero green monkey kidney cells and required 3 weeks of culture before viral cytopathic effects were evident. These observations support the concept that latent infection of sensory ganglia may be the source of virus in recurrent herpetic disease in man.
The mammalian X and Y chromosomes, in contrast to the autosomes, pair during male meiosis only near the telomeres. Alleles localized in this region can undergo reciprocal exchange during meiosis. Because such sequences do not show strict sex-linked inheritance, they have been termed pseudoautosomal. In man, several DNA sequences have been described which show pseudoautosomal transmission and which are localized in the pairing region at the ends of the short arms of both the X and Y chromosomes (refs 6-9, and D. Page, unpublished results). We now show that the transgenic mouse strain, Mov-15, contains a single Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV) genome in its germline, and genetic evidence indicates that the provirus is integrated into the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosome. Proviral copies are lost or gained in 7% of male meioses in this strain, and mouse sequences flanking the provirus are tandemly repeated and highly variable. We conclude that unequal recombination events occur with high frequency in the pairing region, possibly because of the presence of repeated sequences.
Polyoma virus is a papovavirus that productively infects mouse cells. In cells of other species, such as rat cells, polyoma virus is virtually unable to replicate, and a small proportion of infected cells become stably transformed. The ability of polyoma virus to transform infected cells is determined by genes that encode the large, middle and small T antigens and which are found in the early region of the virus genome. We have inserted the transforming region of polyoma virus into a murine leukaemia virus (MLV) vector, to generate a replication-defective transforming retrovirus which for the first time allows efficient transformation of mouse cells by the polyoma virus middle T gene. During the life cycle of this recombinant virus the intervening sequence present in the original polyoma virus middle T gene was removed. The recombinant virus that we have constructed is analogous to other acutely transforming retroviruses, and demonstrates that the polyoma middle T gene is a dominant transforming oncogene.
A graft-versus-host reaction induced in (SJL/J x C57BL/1)F(1) hybrid mice by injection of SJL/J spleen cells resulted in 100 percent incidence of tumors at 40 days. Transplantation studies revealed that the tumors were antigenically C57BL/1. Since both SJL/J and C57BL/1 mice carry tumorigenic virus, the evidence suggests a viral etiology.
Retroviral DNA can be subjected to cytosine-to-uracil editing through the action of members of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases. Here we demonstrate that APOBEC-mediated cytidine deamination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virion RNA can also occur. We speculate that the natural substrates of the APOBEC enzymes may extend to RNA viruses that do not replicate through DNA intermediates. Thus, cytosine-to-uracil editing may contribute to the sequence diversification of many viruses.
The picornavirus family includes several pathogens such as poliovirus, rhinovirus (the major cause of the common cold), hepatitis A virus and the foot-and-mouth disease virus. Picornaviral proteins are expressed by direct translation of the genomic RNA into a single, large polyprotein precursor. Proteolysis of the viral polyprotein into the mature proteins is assured by the viral 3C enzymes, which are cysteine proteinases. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure at 2.3 A resolution of the 3C proteinase from hepatitis A virus (HAV-3C). The overall architecture of HAV-3C reveals a fold resembling that of the chymotrypsin family of serine proteinases, which is consistent with earlier predictions. Catalytic residues include Cys 172 as nucleophile and His 44 as general base. The 3C cleavage specificity for glutamine residues is defined primarily by His 191. The overall structure suggests that an intermolecular (trans) cleavage releases 3C and that there is an active proteinase in the polyprotein.
A common viral immune evasion strategy involves mutating viral surface proteins in order to evade host neutralizing antibodies. Such immune evasion tactics have not previously been intentionally applied to the development of novel viral gene delivery vectors that overcome the critical problem of anti-vector immunity. Recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vector-based vaccines for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and other pathogens have proved highly immunogenic in preclinical studies but will probably be limited by the high prevalence of pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity in human populations, particularly in the developing world. Here we show that rAd5 vectors can be engineered to circumvent anti-Ad5 immunity. We constructed novel chimaeric rAd5 vectors in which the seven short hypervariable regions (HVRs) on the surface of the Ad5 hexon protein were replaced with the corresponding HVRs from the rare adenovirus serotype Ad48. These HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors were produced at high titres and were stable through serial passages in vitro. HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus Gag proved comparably immunogenic to parental rAd5 vectors in naive mice and rhesus monkeys. In the presence of high levels of pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity, the immunogenicity of HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors was not detectably suppressed, whereas the immunogenicity of parental rAd5 vectors was abrogated. These data demonstrate that functionally relevant Ad5-specific neutralizing antibodies are focused on epitopes located within the hexon HVRs. Moreover, these studies show that recombinant viral vectors can be engineered to circumvent pre-existing anti-vector immunity by removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins. Such chimaeric viral vectors may have important practical implications for vaccination and gene therapy.
The production of recombinant retroviruses is an important episode in the natural history of thymic leukaemia in AKR and HRS/J (hr/hr) mices. These viruses apparently originate from ecotropic and xenotropic precursors in the late preleukaemic stage of the disease. Analyses of their structural proteins and genomic oligonucleotides indicate that they arise by recombination of env genes of the precursor viruses. This event leads to a viral envelope glycoprotein (gp70) with some peptides that have features of the gp70 glycoproteins of ecotropic and xenotropic viruses, and others that are unique for each recombinant virus. The former property explains the broad host range of recombinant viruses, and hence their designation as dual tropic or polytropic viruses. It has been postulated that the unique aspect of each recombinant's gp70 determines the phenotypes of leukaemic cells. Polytropic viruses may be highly thymotropic. Their systemic administration results in an infection that confines itself virtually to the thymus. Moreover, these viruses are leukaemogenic whereas their precursors are not, or only weakly so. The leukaemogenicity of polytropic viruses is, however, restricted to certain inbred strains of mice. The HRS/J isolate PTV-1 is leukaemogenic in HRS/J and CBA/J mice, but not in SWR/J or NIH/Swiss mice. The experiments described here demonstrate that a single dominant gene permits infection by thymocytes by a leukaemogenic polytrophic virus. CBA/J mice, which develop thymic leukaemia after infection by this virus, posesses this gene, whereas leukaemia-resistant NFS mice lack it.
Retroviruses lacking oncogenes can induce tumours in animals, and the tumour cells are frequently found to contain proviral DNA inserted next to a proto-oncogene, which is thus placed under the regulatory control of the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR). This altered regulation leads to overexpression of the proto-oncogene, which presumably contributes to the growth properties of the tumour cells. fim-2 has been described as a retroviral integration site frequently and specifically involved in murine myeloblastic leukaemias induced in vivo or in vitro by the replication-competent Friend murine leukaemia virus (F-MuLV). Here we report that fim-2 spans the 5'-end of the murine proto-oncogene c-fms, known to code for a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity probably identical to the receptor of the haemopoietic growth factor, monocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1). Proviral integration in the fim-2 region results in a high expression of a normal sized c-fms messenger RNA. We also observe that some tumours have lost the fim-2/c-fms germ line allele. These results provide the first evidence for the presumed involvement of c-fms in myelomonocytic leukaemias.
The heterotrimeric influenza virus polymerase, containing the PA, PB1 and PB2 proteins, catalyses viral RNA replication and transcription in the nucleus of infected cells. PB1 holds the polymerase active site and reportedly harbours endonuclease activity, whereas PB2 is responsible for cap binding. The PA amino terminus is understood to be the major functional part of the PA protein and has been implicated in several roles, including endonuclease and protease activities as well as viral RNA/complementary RNA promoter binding. Here we report the 2.2 angstrom (A) crystal structure of the N-terminal 197 residues of PA, termed PA(N), from an avian influenza H5N1 virus. The PA(N) structure has an alpha/beta architecture and reveals a bound magnesium ion coordinated by a motif similar to the (P)DX(N)(D/E)XK motif characteristic of many endonucleases. Structural comparisons and mutagenesis analysis of the motif identified in PA(N) provide further evidence that PA(N) holds an endonuclease active site. Furthermore, functional analysis with in vivo ribonucleoprotein reconstitution and direct in vitro endonuclease assays strongly suggest that PA(N) holds the endonuclease active site and has critical roles in endonuclease activity of the influenza virus polymerase, rather than PB1. The high conservation of this endonuclease active site among influenza strains indicates that PA(N) is an important target for the design of new anti-influenza therapeutics.
Helicases are a ubiquitous class of enzymes involved in nearly all aspects of DNA and RNA metabolism. Despite recent progress in understanding their mechanism of action, limited resolution has left inaccessible the detailed mechanisms by which these enzymes couple the rearrangement of nucleic acid structures to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Observing individual mechanistic cycles of these motor proteins is central to understanding their cellular functions. Here we follow in real time, at a resolution of two base pairs and 20 ms, the RNA translocation and unwinding cycles of a hepatitis C virus helicase (NS3) monomer. NS3 is a representative superfamily-2 helicase essential for viral replication, and therefore a potentially important drug target. We show that the cyclic movement of NS3 is coordinated by ATP in discrete steps of 11 +/- 3 base pairs, and that actual unwinding occurs in rapid smaller substeps of 3.6 +/- 1.3 base pairs, also triggered by ATP binding, indicating that NS3 might move like an inchworm. This ATP-coupling mechanism is likely to be applicable to other non-hexameric helicases involved in many essential cellular functions. The assay developed here should be useful in investigating a broad range of nucleic acid translocation motors.
Polioviruses occur as three distinct serotypes, 1, 2 and 3, and are composed of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7,450 nucleotides enclosed in an icosahedral particle of diameter 27 nm. The three-dimensional crystallographic structure of poliovirus type 1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution, providing a detailed knowledge of the folding and arrangement of the individual virus proteins, VP1-VP4. From this and the characterization of monoclonal antibody-resistant mutants, the amino acids contributing to antigenic sites have been identified and located on the surface of the virus particle. Here we describe the construction and characterization of a poliovirus chimaera having a defined region of type 3 inserted into type 1. This virus has composite antigenicity and the substitute site is immunogenic in small animals and primates. The ability to construct such viruses has implications for the design of improved poliovirus vaccine strains or vaccines against other picornaviruses, such as hepatitis A.
The simian virus 40 (SV40) 72-base pair (bp) tandem-repeated sequences have a crucial role as an activator element in viral gene expression. We replaced the SV40 72-bp repeat with a 72-bp repeat derived from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of cloned Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV) DNA. Although there is no detectable sequence homology to SV40, the MSV repeats can substitute functionally for the SV40 repeats and generate a viable virus in monkey kidney cells.
The nucleotide sequence of the long terminal repeat sequence (LTR) of the human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type III (HTLV-III) was determined. This virus is associated etiologically with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The LTR was found to be 634 base pairs in length with U3, R, and U5 regions of 453, 98, and 83 bp, respectively. The proviral DNA is flanked by a 7-base-pair direct repeat. The promoter and polyadenylation signals are situated 27 and 24 base pairs upstream from the respective transcriptional initiation and polyadenylation sites. The primer binding site is complementary to transfer RNA-lysine. The LTR of HTLV-III, like that of HTLV-I, showed a limited homology to enhancer-like sequences within two genes expressed specifically in T lymphocytes, T-cell growth factor, and gamma-interferon. Structural comparisons revealed that the LTR of HTLV-III is distantly related to those of HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and bovine leukemia virus.
There are at least three RNA silencing pathways for silencing specific genes in plants. In these pathways, silencing signals can be amplified and transmitted between cells, and may even be self-regulated by feedback mechanisms. Diverse biological roles of these pathways have been established, including defence against viruses, regulation of gene expression and the condensation of chromatin into heterochromatin. We are now in a good position to investigate the full extent of this functional diversity in genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of genome control.
A protoplast fusion method was developed to stably transfect human cells with pSV2-derived plasmids at frequencies greater than 10(-3). This procedure made it possible to test the biological effect of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene independent of the viral structures required for infection. A pSV2gpt+ plasmid constructed to carry a subgenomic fragment of HBV that contained the core antigen gene (HBc gene) was transfected into human cells. A human epithelial cell line was stably transfected with the HBc+ gene by selecting recipient cells for expression of guanine phosphoribosyl transferase expression. With this gpt+/HBc+ cell line it was shown that growth in serum-free medium or treatment with 5'-azacytidine stimulates the production of the HBV core antigen. A hepatocellular carcinoma carrying the entire HBV genome was stimulated to produce the HBc gene product in response to the same factors that stimulated HBcAg production in the gpt+/HBc+ cell line constructed by transfection. The temporal relation between the cytopathologic response and HBc gene expression was similar for both cell types, indicating a primary role for HBc gene expression in the cytopathology of HBV-infected human liver.
The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) is critical for the inducible expression of multiple cellular and viral genes involved in inflammation and infection including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and adhesion molecules. The anti-inflammatory drugs sodium salicylate and aspirin inhibited the activation of NF-kappa B, which further explains the mechanism of action of these drugs. This inhibition prevented the degradation of the NF-kappa B inhibitor, I kappa B, and therefore NF-kappa B was retained in the cytosol. Sodium salicylate and aspirin also inhibited NF-kappa B-dependent transcription from the Ig kappa enhancer and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR) in transfected T cells.
WIN 51711 and WIN 52084 are structurally related, antiviral compounds that inhibit the replication of rhino (common cold) viruses and related picornaviruses. They prevent the pH-mediated uncoating of the viral RNA. The compounds consist of a 3-methylisoxazole group that inserts itself into the hydrophobic interior of the VP1 beta-barrel, a connecting seven-membered aliphatic chain, and a 4-oxazolinylphenoxy group (OP) that covers the entrance to an ion channel in the floor of the "canyon." Viral disassembly may be inhibited by preventing the collapse of the VP1 hydrophobic pocket or by blocking the flow of ions into the virus interior.
Infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with cellular activation and expression of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor. A genetically engineered fusion toxin, DAB486 IL-2, that contains the enzymatic site and translocation domain of diphtheria toxin and the receptor binding domain of IL-2 specifically kills cells that express high-affinity IL-2 receptors. This toxin selectively eliminated the HIV-1-infected cells from mixed cultures of infected and uninfected cells and inhibited production of viral proteins and infectious virus. Thus, cellular activation antigens present a target for early antiviral intervention.
The virulence properties of many pathogenic bacteria are due to proteins encoded by large gene clusters called pathogenicity islands, which are found in a variety of human pathogens including Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Helicobacter pylori, Vibrio cholerae, and animal and plant pathogens such as Dichelobacter nodosus and Pseudomonas syringae. Although the presence of pathogenicity islands is a prerequisite for many bacterial diseases, little is known about their origins or mechanism of transfer into the bacterium. The bacterial agent of epidemic cholera, Vibrio cholerae, contains a bacteriophage known as cholera-toxin phage (CTXphi), which encodes the cholera toxin, and a large pathogenicity island called the VPI (for V. cholerae pathogenicity island) which itself encodes a toxin-coregulated pilus that functions as a colonization factor and as a CTXphi receptor. We have now identified the VPI pathogenicity island as the genome of another filamentous bacteriophage, VPIphi. We show that VPIphi is transferred between V. cholerae strains and provide evidence that the TcpA subunit of the toxin-coregulated type IV pilus is in fact a coat protein of VPIphi. Our results are the first description of a phage that encodes a receptor for another phage and of a virus-virus interaction that is necessary for bacterial pathogenicity.
Despite the considerable research that has been carried out into viral neutralization by antiviral antibody, its mechanisms remain poorly understood. Cases have been reported in which antiviral antibody can inhibit viral replication without inhibiting the binding and uptake of virus by susceptible cells. It has been shown that many enveloped viruses enter their target cells by endocytosis and are subsequently located in cellular compartments of increasing acidity. With several enveloped viruses this acidic pH can catalyse a fusion reaction between the membrane of the virus particle and that of a prelysosomal endosome, thus enabling the viral core to enter the cytosol and replication to commence. We have recently demonstrated that such an endosomal fusion event at mild acidic pH is involved in the entry pathway of the enveloped flavivirus, West Nile virus (WNV), into macrophages. We now show that antiviral antibody can neutralize WNV by inhibiting this intraendosomal acid-catalysed fusion step and we speculate on possible implications for the future design of antiviral vaccines.
A human papovavirus, JCV, is the etiologic agent of the fatal demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The JCV 98-base-pair tandem repeats, located to the late side of the viral replication origin, were shown to be a transcriptional regulatory element with enhancer-like activity in human fetal glial cells. These tandem repeats share significant homology with the 82-nucleotide rat brain-specific identifier RNA sequence.
Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system are the predominant cell producing HIV-1 in most tissues including the central nervous system (CNS), spinal cord, lung and skin; infection is associated with dementia, neuropathy, pneumonitis, and dermatitis respectively. Different HIV-1 isolates vary markedly in their ability to infect mononuclear phagocytes productively. Here we describe molecular clones of a CNS-derived isolate, HIV-1(JR-FL), which can replicate efficiently in mononuclear phagocytes. Analysis by polymerase chain reaction of early events after infection indicates that the early phase of viral replication before reverse transcription determines tropism. Genetic mapping of the macrophage-tropic phenotype by construction of recombinant viruses indicates that mononuclear phagocyte infectivity can be determined by a 157-amino-acid region of the gp 120 glycoprotein of HIV-1(JR-FL). Significantly, this region is upstream from the previously defined CD4-binding domain. We propose that at least one determinant for mononuclear phagocyte tropism involves target cell interactions with regions of gp120 distinct from the CD4-binding domain.
In Old World primates, TRIM5-alpha confers a potent block to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection that acts after virus entry into cells. Cyclophilin A (CypA) binding to viral capsid protects HIV-1 from a similar activity in human cells. Among New World primates, only owl monkeys exhibit post-entry restriction of HIV-1 (ref. 1). Paradoxically, the barrier to HIV-1 in owl monkey cells is released by capsid mutants or drugs that disrupt capsid interaction with CypA. Here we show that knockdown of owl monkey CypA by RNA interference (RNAi) correlates with suppression of anti-HIV-1 activity. However, reintroduction of CypA protein to RNAi-treated cells did not restore antiviral activity. A search for additional RNAi targets unearthed TRIMCyp, an RNAi-responsive messenger RNA encoding a TRIM5-CypA fusion protein. TRIMCyp accounts for post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in owl monkeys and blocks HIV-1 infection when transferred to otherwise infectable human or rat cells. It seems that TRIMCyp arose after the divergence of New and Old World primates when a LINE-1 retrotransposon catalysed the insertion of a CypA complementary DNA into the TRIM5 locus. This is the first vertebrate example of a chimaeric gene generated by this mechanism of exon shuffling.
The transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) controls the expression of many immunomodulatory proteins. African swine fever virus inhibits proinflammatory cytokine expression in infected macrophages, and a viral protein A238L was found to display the activity of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A by inhibiting NFAT-regulated gene transcription in vivo. This it does by binding the catalytic subunit of calcineurin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase activity.
Membrane fusion induced by the envelope glycoproteins of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIVmac) is a necessary step for the infection of CD4 cells and for the formation of syncytia after infection. Identification of the region in these molecules that mediates the fusion events is important for understanding and possibly interfering with HIV/SIVmac infection and pathogenesis. Amino acid substitutions were made in the 15 NH2-terminal residues of the SIVmac gp32 transmembrane glycoprotein, and the mutants were expressed in recombinant vaccinia viruses, which were then used to infect CD4-expressing T cell lines. Mutations that increased the overall hydrophobicity of the gp32 NH2-terminus increased the ability of the viral envelope to induce syncytia formation, whereas introduction of polar or charged amino acids in the same region abolished the fusogenic function of the viral envelope. Hydrophobicity in the NH2-terminal region of gp32 may therefore be an important correlate of viral virulence in vivo and could perhaps be exploited to generate a more effective animal model for the study of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
Two transgenic mice were obtained that contain in their chromosomes the complete hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome except for the core gene. These mice secrete particles of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in the serum. In one mouse, HBV DNA sequences that had integrated at two different sites were shown to segregate independently in the first filial generation (F1) and only one of the sequences allowed expression of the surface antigen. Among these animals the males produced five to ten times more HBsAg than the females. A 2.1-kilobase messenger RNA species comigrating with the major surface gene messenger RNA is expressed specifically in the liver in the two original mice. The results suggest that the HBV sequences introduced into the mice are able to confer a tissue-specific expression to the S gene. In addition, the HBV transgenic mice represent a new model for the chronic carrier state of hepatitis B virus infection.
Cells infected with vaccinia virus in the presence of hydroxyurea (HU), which blocks DNA replication, were examined in thin sections by electron microscopy at intervals after removal of HU. Dense, fibrillar material was observed at the orifice formed just before closure of the membrane constituting the envelope of the immature form of the virus. It is concluded that synchrony of assembly enabled stages in the condensation and insertion of viral deoxyribonucleoprotein to be observed. The mechanism appears to be similar to that encountered in morphologic studies of herpes simplex virus and in biochemical studies of poliovirus, adenovirus, and several bacteriophages.
Membranes are essential for selectively controlling the passage of molecules in and out of cells and mediating the response of cells to their environment. Biological membranes and their associated proteins present considerable difficulties for structural analysis. Although enveloped viruses have been imaged at about 9 A resolution by cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction, no detailed crystallographic structure of a membrane system has been described. The structure of the bacteriophage PRD1 particle, determined by X-ray crystallography at about 4 A resolution, allows the first detailed analysis of a membrane-containing virus. The architecture of the viral capsid and its implications for virus assembly are presented in the accompanying paper. Here we show that the electron density also reveals the icosahedral lipid bilayer, beneath the protein capsid, enveloping the viral DNA. The viral membrane contains about 26,000 lipid molecules asymmetrically distributed between the membrane leaflets. The inner leaflet is composed predominantly of zwitterionic phosphatidylethanolamine molecules, facilitating a very close interaction with the viral DNA, which we estimate to be packaged to a pressure of about 45 atm, factors that are likely to be important during membrane-mediated DNA translocation into the host cell. In contrast, the outer leaflet is enriched in phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, which show a marked lateral segregation within the icosahedral asymmetric unit. In addition, the lipid headgroups show a surprising degree of order.
The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA1) is expressed in latently EBV-infected B lymphocytes that persist for life in healthy virus carriers, and is the only viral protein regularly detected in all malignancies associated with EBV. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted, EBNA1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses have not been demonstrated. Using recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding chimaeric proteins containing an immunodominant human leukocyte antigen A11-restricted CTL epitope, amino acids 416-424 of the EBNA4 protein, inserted within the intact EBNA1, or within an EBNA1 deletion mutant devoid of the internal Gly-Ala repetitive sequence, we demonstrate that the Gly-Ala repeats generate a cis-acting inhibitory signal that interferes with antigen processing and MHC class I-restricted presentation. Insertion of the Gly-Ala repeats downstream of the 416-424 epitope inhibited CTL recognition of a chimaeric EBNA4 protein. The results highlight a previously unknown mechanism of viral escape from CTL surveillance, and support the view that the resistance of cells expressing EBNA1 to rejection mediated by CTL is a critical requirement for EBV persistence and pathogenesis.
The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) trans-activator Tat is an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs because inhibition of Tat would arrest the virus at an early stage. The drug Ro 5-3335 [7-chloro-5-(2-pyrryl)-3H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2(H)-one], inhibited gene expression by HIV-1 at the level of transcriptional trans-activation by Tat. The compound did not inhibit the basal activity of the promoter. Both Tat and its target sequence TAR were required for the observed inhibitory activity. Ro 5-3335 reduced the amount of cell-associated viral RNA and antigen in acutely, as well as in chronically infected cells in vitro (median inhibition concentration 0.1 to 1 micromolar). Effective inhibition of viral replication was also observed 24 hours after cells were transfected with infectious recombinant HIV-1 DNA. The compound was active against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and against 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT)-resistant clinical isolates.
The pocket domain of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor is central to Rb function, and is frequently inactivated by the binding of the human papilloma virus E7 oncoprotein in cervical cancer. The crystal structure of the Rb pocket bound to a nine-residue E7 peptide containing the LxCxE motif, shared by other Rb-binding viral and cellular proteins, shows that the LxCxE peptide binds a highly conserved groove on the B-box portion of the pocket; the A-box portion appears to be required for the stable folding of the B box. Also highly conserved is the extensive A-B interface, suggesting that it may be an additional protein-binding site. The A and B boxes each contain the cyclin-fold structural motif, with the LxCxE-binding site on the B-box cyclin fold being similar to a Cdk2-binding site of cyclin A and to a TBP-binding site of TFIIB.
Infections by the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses cause a rapidly fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans for which no approved antivirals are available. Filovirus entry is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein (GP), which attaches viral particles to the cell surface, delivers them to endosomes and catalyses fusion between viral and endosomal membranes. Additional host factors in the endosomal compartment are probably required for viral membrane fusion; however, despite considerable efforts, these critical host factors have defied molecular identification. Here we describe a genome-wide haploid genetic screen in human cells to identify host factors required for Ebola virus entry. Our screen uncovered 67 mutations disrupting all six members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein-sorting (HOPS) multisubunit tethering complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosomes to lysosomes, and 39 independent mutations that disrupt the endo/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). Cells defective for the HOPS complex or NPC1 function, including primary fibroblasts derived from human Niemann-Pick type C1 disease patients, are resistant to infection by Ebola virus and Marburg virus, but remain fully susceptible to a suite of unrelated viruses. We show that membrane fusion mediated by filovirus glycoproteins and viral escape from the vesicular compartment require the NPC1 protein, independent of its known function in cholesterol transport. Our findings uncover unique features of the entry pathway used by filoviruses and indicate potential antiviral strategies to combat these deadly agents.
Rinderpest is a highly contagious ruminant viral disease manifested by a rapid course and greater than 90% mortality. Infectious vaccinia virus recombinants were constructed that express either the hemagglutinin or the fusion gene of rinderpest virus. All cattle vaccinated with either recombinant or with the combined recombinants produced neutralizing antibodies against rinderpest virus and were protected against the disease when challenged with more than 1000 times the lethal dose of the virus.
The genome of the human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III/LAV) has the potential to encode at least three polypeptides in addition to those encoded by the gag, pol, and env genes. In this study, the product of the sor (short open reading frame) region, which overlaps the 3' end of the pol gene, was found to be a protein with a molecular weight of 23,000. An assay was developed for testing the ability of cloned HTLV-III proviruses to produce viruses cytopathic for T4+ lymphocytes. In the cell line used, C8166, neither the HTLV-III sor gene product nor the complete 3'-orf gene product were necessary for the replication or cytopathic effects of the HTLV-III.
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has become a worldwide epidemic, so the development of vaccines and antiviral agents effective against the causative agent, human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III), is vital. This work would be greatly simplified if a suitable animal model could be developed. Here we report the isolation of an HTLV-III-related retrovirus, STLV-III/Delta, from rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with transmissible simian AIDS (SAIDS) and from asymptomatic sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys). SAIDS was initially diagnosed in several macaques previously inoculated with tissue homogenates of mangabey origin. Western blot analysis of both the mangabey and macaque sera demonstrated the presence of antibody cross-reactive primarily with the HTLV-III proteins p24 and p61. In a related experiment, analysis of these same sera revealed simian antibody to STLV-III/Delta proteins similar, but not identical, to those of HTLV-III with estimated relative molecular masses (Mrs) of 16,000 (16K), 26K, 35K, 45K, 60K and 110K. Infection of the mangabey, an African primate, with an HTLV-III-related virus may provide a clue to the origin of HTLV-III in humans. The apparent difference in susceptibility to SAIDS-like disease between infected macaques and mangabeys suggests that these species may respond differently to STLV-III infection.
The reovirus core is an assembly with a relative molecular mass of 52 million that synthesizes, modifies and exports viral messenger RNA. Analysis of its structure by X-ray crystallography shows that there are alternative, specific and completely non-equivalent contacts made by several surfaces of two of its proteins; that the RNA capping and export apparatus is a hollow cylinder, which probably sequesters its substrate to ensure completion of the capping reactions; that the genomic double-stranded RNA is coiled into concentric layers within the particle; and that there is a protein shell that appears to be common to all groups of double-stranded RNA viruses.
The efficacy of pre- and postexposure treatment with the antiviral compound (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA) was tested against simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in macaques as a model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). PMPA was administered subcutaneously once daily beginning either 48 hours before, 4 hours after, or 24 hours after virus inoculation. Treatment continued for 4 weeks and the virologic, immunologic, and clinical status of the macaques was monitored for up to 56 weeks. PMPA prevented SIV infection in all macaques without toxicity, whereas all control macaques became infected. These results suggest a potential role for PMPA prophylaxis against early HIV infection in cases of known exposure.
Understanding the lineage differentiation of memory T cells is a central question in immunology. We investigated this issue by analysing the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7, which defines distinct subsets of naive and memory T lymphocytes with different homing and effector capacities and antiviral immune responses to HIV and cytomegalovirus. Ex vivo analysis of the expression of CD45RA and CCR7 antigens, together with in vitro analysis of the cell-division capacity of different memory CD8+ T-cell populations, identified four subsets of HIV- and CMV-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes, and indicated the following lineage differentiation pattern: CD45RA+ CCR7+ --> CD45RA- CCR7+ --> CD45RA- CCR7- --> CD45RA+ CCR7-. Here we demonstrate through analysis of cell division (predominantly restricted to the CCR7+ CD8+ T-cell subsets) that the differentiation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells is a two-step process characterized initially by a phase of proliferation largely restricted to the CCR7+ CD8+ cell subsets, followed by a phase of functional maturation encompassing the CCR7- CD8+ cell subsets. The distribution of these populations in HIV- and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells showed that the HIV-specific cell pool was predominantly (70%) composed of pre-terminally differentiated CD45RA- CCR7- cells, whereas the CMV-specific cell pool consisted mainly (50%) of the terminally differentiated CD45RA+ CCR7- cells. These results demonstrate a skewed maturation of HIV-specific memory CD8+ T cells during HIV infection.
The biological effects of ras oncogene activation in B cells were studied by using amphotropic retroviral vectors to introduce H- or N-ras oncogenes into human B lymphoblasts immortalized by Epstein-Barr virus. Expression of both H- and N-ras oncogenes led to malignant transformation of these cells, as shown by clonogenicity in semisolid media and tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice. In addition, terminal differentiation into plasma cells was detectable as specific changes in morphology, immunoglobulin secretion, and cell surface antigen expression. This combined effect, promoting growth and differentiation in human lymphoblasts, represents a novel biological action of ras oncogenes and has implications for the pathogenesis of terminally differentiated B-lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma.
Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I and II are unusual among replication-competent retroviruses in that they contain a fourth gene (chi) necessary for replication. The chi gene product, p chi, transcriptionally transactivates the viral long repeat (LTR), and is thus a positive regulator. To investigate p chi transactivation, sequences from the U3 regions of the LTRs of HTLV-I and -II were inserted into the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) LTR by recombinant DNA techniques. Transient expression assays of the chimeric LTRs indicated that the HTLV sequences conferred to the M-MuLV LTR responsiveness to HTLV p chi protein. M-MuLV enhancers were not required for function of the chimeric LTRs. Infectious recombinant M-MuLVs containing chimeric LTRs were also generated. These viruses showed higher infectivity when assayed in mouse cells expressing HTLV-II p chi protein compared to normal mouse cells. Thus the HTLV sequences were able to confer p chi responsiveness to infectious M-MuLV. The generation of a virus dependent on a transactivating protein for its replication has implications for the evolution of the human T-cell leukemia viruses.
Reverse transcriptase activity of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was blocked in vitro by immunoglobulin G (IgG) derived from certain individuals infected with this retrovirus. A heterogeneous immune response for inhibition of enzyme function was noted. Catalytic activity was depressed by 50% or more with the use of 10 micrograms of IgG from 11 of 16 HIV-seropositive asymptomatic carriers, but from 0 of 8 seronegative controls and 2 of 12 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the AIDS-related complex (ARC). The inhibitor was confined to the F(ab')2 fragment. It was not directed against the poly(rA) X oligo(dT) template, nor against major envelope or structural viral antigens, and did not cross-react with bacterial, avian, or other mammalian DNA polymerases. It did not correlate with recognition of polymerase antigens by radioimmunoprecipitation. Loss of this inhibitor may be associated with development of clinical disease. Ten asymptomatic HIV-seropositive carriers with high titers of IgG antibodies to reverse transcriptase were followed for a mean of 3 years. All of four lost inhibitory capability prior to development of AIDS or ARC, while titers persist in the six who remain clinically healthy.
Interferons (IFNs) are critical for protection from viral infection, but the pathways linking virus recognition to IFN induction remain poorly understood. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce vast amounts of IFN-alpha in response to the wild-type influenza virus. Here, we show that this requires endosomal recognition of influenza genomic RNA and signaling by means of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and MyD88. Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules of nonviral origin also induce TLR7-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines. These results identify ssRNA as a ligand for TLR7 and suggest that cells of the innate immune system sense endosomal ssRNA to detect infection by RNA viruses.
Particles resembling adenovirus were recovered from tumors induced by adenovirus-12. The particles were similar to incomplete adenovirus in size, subunit morphology, and density. The presence of such incomplete viral units helps to explain why attempts to isolate infectious virus from adenovirus-induced tumors have failed despite the serological evidence that viral elements are present.
Legionella pneumophila, the bacterial agent of legionnaires' disease, replicates intracellularly within a specialized vacuole of mammalian and protozoan host cells. Little is known about the specialized vacuole except that the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system is essential for its formation and maintenance. The Legionella genome database contains two open reading frames encoding polypeptides (LepA and LepB) with predicted coiled-coil regions and weak homology to SNAREs; these are delivered to host cells by an Icm/Dot-dependent mechanism. Analysis of mutant strains suggests that the Lep proteins may enable the Legionella to commandeer a protozoan exocytic pathway for dissemination of the pathogen.
The results of molecular hybridization experiments with high-molecular-weight RNA isolated from RNA tumor viruses and DNA from normal cells suggest that RNA tumor virus genomes originate from cell genes. Some RNA tumor viruses (here called class 1) appear to have been generated in recent times in that their RNA is closely related in nucleotide sequence to certain cell genes (class 1 genes). A second class of RNA tumor viruses (here called class 2) is more distantly related to genomic information of normal cells. Structural properties of the RNA of RNA tumor viruses lead us to propose that the tumor virus RNA is originated when RNA transcripts of class 1 genes are processed by a mechanism we call "paraprocessing." We postulate that RNA paraprocessing is normally used only at particular times during differentiation and is characterized by the cytoplasmic appearance of high-molecular-weight RNA chains containing terminal polyadenylic acid (200 residues). Paraprocessing of class 1 gene transcripts in committed or differentiated cells is considered to be aberrant in transcription that can lead to the generation of an RNA tumor virus genome. If the paraprocessed class 1 gene transcript codes for a reverse transcriptase, replication of the RNA becomes possible. Transfer of the replicating RNA to a new cell can result in genetic change such that the virus genome mutates, differing from the original progenitor genes. We propose that this genetic change causes class 1 viruses to become class 2. These ideas are applied to evidence concerning the biology of infection of RNA tumor viruses and concerning the involvement of RNA tumor viruses in human cancer. Genetic change can also occur during the origination of an RNA tumor virus genome by repeated reverse transcription and recombination (45) or by genetic alteration of particularly changeable cell genes ("hot spots") (43).
The integral membrane protein M2 of influenza virus forms pH-gated proton channels in the viral lipid envelope. The low pH of an endosome activates the M2 channel before haemagglutinin-mediated fusion. Conductance of protons acidifies the viral interior and thereby facilitates dissociation of the matrix protein from the viral nucleoproteins--a required process for unpacking of the viral genome. In addition to its role in release of viral nucleoproteins, M2 in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) membrane prevents premature conformational rearrangement of newly synthesized haemagglutinin during transport to the cell surface by equilibrating the pH of the TGN with that of the host cell cytoplasm. Inhibiting the proton conductance of M2 using the anti-viral drug amantadine or rimantadine inhibits viral replication. Here we present the structure of the tetrameric M2 channel in complex with rimantadine, determined by NMR. In the closed state, four tightly packed transmembrane helices define a narrow channel, in which a 'tryptophan gate' is locked by intermolecular interactions with aspartic acid. A carboxy-terminal, amphipathic helix oriented nearly perpendicular to the transmembrane helix forms an inward-facing base. Lowering the pH destabilizes the transmembrane helical packing and unlocks the gate, admitting water to conduct protons, whereas the C-terminal base remains intact, preventing dissociation of the tetramer. Rimantadine binds at four equivalent sites near the gate on the lipid-facing side of the channel and stabilizes the closed conformation of the pore. Drug-resistance mutations are predicted to counter the effect of drug binding by either increasing the hydrophilicity of the pore or weakening helix-helix packing, thus facilitating channel opening.
DNA recombinant technology has radically changed hepatitis B virus (HBV) virology. The genetic organization, transcription and replication of the virus are basically understood, structures of integrated HBV sequences in hepatocellular carcinoma have been characterized, and new vaccines produced by recombinant DNA technique are being developed.
Although promoter regions for many plant nuclear genes have been sequenced, identification of the active promoter sequence has been carried out only for the octopine synthase promoter. That analysis was of callus tissue and made use of an enzyme assay. We have analysed the effects of 5' deletions in a plant viral promoter in tobacco callus as well as in regenerated plants, including different plant tissues. We assayed the RNA transcription product which allows a more direct assessment of deletion effects. The cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter provides a model plant nuclear promoter system, as its double-strand DNA genome is transcribed by host nuclear RNA polymerase II from a CaMV minichromosome. Sequences extending to -46 were sufficient for accurate transcription initiation whereas the region between -46 and -105 increased greatly the level of transcription. The 35S promoter showed no tissue-specificity of expression.
The human T-cell leukemia viruses HTLV-I and HTLV-II are unique among the transforming retroviruses of vertebrates in their ability to transform human T cells in vitro and in their close association with human malignancies (T-cell lymphomas and leukemia). Their genomes are relatively simple, containing the genes gag, pol, env, and a 3' region termed "X." This 3' region may be responsible for the transforming potential of the viruses. The existence of proteins encoded by the 3' region has been postulated on the basis of multiple open reading frames. In the present study this region is shown to contain a gene encoding a protein of 40 kilodaltons in HTLV-I and 37 kilodaltons in HTLV-II. It is proposed that these proteins be called, respectively, p40xI and p37xII.
The isolation of a mutant adenovirus carrying an insertion of cellular DNA has led to the identification of a new family of human repetitive sequences, which are found tandemly arranged in the genome. The sequence of the viral insert resembles that of eukaryotic transposable elements.
The human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) is an exogenous retrovirus which has been associated with adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL). This malignancy of T lymphocytes is endemic to southern Japan, the West Indies, and to a lesser extent, the Middle East, Central Africa and the southeastern United States. ATL cells from patients of diverse geographical origins have been found to be infected with HTLV-1 (ref.6). HTLV is normally tropic for mature T lymphocytes, especially those expressing the helper-inducer surface antigen phenotype (OKT4 or Leu-3-positive), and the neoplastic T cells infected with HTLV generally express receptors for T-cell growth factor (detected by reactivity with anti-Tac antibody). However, we report here the isolation of a HTLV-infected B-lymphocyte clone from the peripheral blood of a patient with ATL. This clone is cytogenetically normal and is not infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Co-culture of cells from this clone with cord blood lymphocytes resulted in transmission of HTLV and the immortalization of either T or B lymphocytes. These results suggest that HTLV may be associated with a broader range of host cells than previously recognized.
In a randomized controlled trial with acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques, both highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and HAART with fixed-schedule structured treatment interruption (STI-HAART; alternating 3 weeks on and 3 weeks off therapy) suppressed viral load. In the STI-HAART group, T cell virus-specific immune response (VIR) and control of viral rebound increased concurrently during subsequent interruptions. In contrast, VIR did not increase and SIV rebounded after permanent treatment withdrawal in all animals on continuous HAART. Fixed-schedule STI-HAART appears to be an effective alternative to continuous HAART for the early treatment of retroviral infection.
Analysis of the cell culture fluid from two new human hepatoma-derived cell lines reveals that 17 of the major human plasma proteins are synthesized and secreted by these cells. One of these cell lines, Hep 3B, also produces the two major polypeptides of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen. When Hep 3B in injected into athymic mice, metastatic hepatocellular carcinomas appear. These cell lines provide experimental models for investigation of plasma protein biosynthesis and the relation of the hepatitis B viru genome to tumorigenicity.
Many bacteriophages and animal viruses integrate their genomes into the chromosomal DNA of their hosts as a method of promoting vertical transmission. Phages that integrate in a site-specific fashion encode an integrase enzyme that catalyses recombination between the phage and host genomes. CTX phi is a filamentous bacteriophage that contains the genes encoding cholera toxin, the principal virulence factor of the diarrhoea-causing Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. CTX phi integrates into the V. cholerae genome in a site-specific manner; however, the approximately 6.9-kilobase (kb) CTX phi genome does not encode any protein with significant homology to known recombinases. Here we report that XerC and XerD, two chromosome-encoded recombinases that ordinarily function to resolve chromosome dimers at the dif recombination site, are essential for CTX phi integration into the V. cholerae genome. The CTX phi integration site was found to overlap with the dif site of the larger of the two V. cholerae chromosomes. Examination of sequences of the integration sites of other filamentous phages indicates that the XerCD recombinases also mediate the integration of these phage genomes at dif-like sites in various bacterial species.
In double-stranded-RNA (dsRNA) viruses found in animals, bacteria and yeast, the genome is transcribed within the structurally intact core of the virion with extraordinary efficiency. The structural organization of the genome and the enzymes involved in the transcription inside any of these viruses, critical for understanding this process, is not known. Here we report what we believe is the first three-dimensional characterization of the viral genome and the transcription complex in a prototypical dsRNA virus. Rotavirus is a large (diameter 1,000 A) icosahedral virus composed of three capsid protein layers and 11 dsRNA segments. It is the most important cause of gastroenteritis in children, accounting for over a million deaths annually. We show that viral dsRNA forms a dodecahedral structure in which the RNA double helices, interacting closely with the inner capsid layer, are packed around the enzyme complex located at the icosahedral 5-fold axes. The ordered RNA accounts for about 4,500 out of a total 18,525 base pairs in the genome, the largest amount of icosahedrally ordered RNA observed in any virus structure to date. We propose that the observed organization of the dsRNA is conducive for an orchestrated movement of the RNA relative to the enzyme complex during transcription.
The recent emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus strains with subtype H5N1 pose a global threat to human health. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of viral replication is critical for development of anti-influenza virus drugs. The influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) heterotrimer has crucial roles in viral RNA replication and transcription. It contains three proteins: PA, PB1 and PB2. PB1 harbours polymerase and endonuclease activities and PB2 is responsible for cap binding; PA is implicated in RNA replication and proteolytic activity, although its function is less clearly defined. Here we report the 2.9 angstrom structure of avian H5N1 influenza A virus PA (PA(C), residues 257-716) in complex with the PA-binding region of PB1 (PB1(N), residues 1-25). PA(C) has a fold resembling a dragon's head with PB1(N) clamped into its open 'jaws'. PB1(N) is a known inhibitor that blocks assembly of the polymerase heterotrimer and abolishes viral replication. Our structure provides details for the binding of PB1(N) to PA(C) at the atomic level, demonstrating a potential target for novel anti-influenza therapeutics. We also discuss a potential nucleotide binding site and the roles of some known residues involved in polymerase activity. Furthermore, to explore the role of PA in viral replication and transcription, we propose a model for the influenza RdRp heterotrimer by comparing PA(C) with the lambda3 reovirus polymerase structure, and docking the PA(C) structure into an available low resolution electron microscopy map.
Deoxyribonucleic acid in the host cell does not contain a sequence complementary to the nucleic acid of an RNA virus. Specific formation of hybridbetween deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid was used as a detecting device. The test was internally controlled and sensitive enough to reveal complementary stretches in the DNA corresponding to 10 percent of the viral ribonucleic acid. The implications of the results for replication and transcription of RNA are discussed.
The pathogenic human retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes two trans-acting nuclear proteins, tat and rev, whose functional expression is essential for viral replication in vitro. The tat protein greatly enhances the expression of both structural and regulatory genes of HIV-1 (linked to the viral long-terminal-repeat promoter element), whereas the rev gene product (previously termed art or trs) has only been shown to be required for the synthesis of structural proteins. Here, we demonstrate that rev also moderates the expression of regulatory genes of HIV-1. It decreases the expression of messenger RNAs that encode the full-length form of the viral tat gene product or the rev protein itself, and induces the synthesis of a previously unreported, truncated tat protein. These actions of rev are mediated by a dramatic shift in the ratio of spliced to unspliced cytoplasmic HIV-1 mRNA. Therefore rev not only activates the synthesis of the viral structural proteins, but also modulates the level and quality of HIV-1 regulatory gene expression.
A temperature sensitive mutant has been isolated for the first time from a replication defective acute leukaemia virus, AEV. In vivo, at 41 degrees C, the mutant shows a reduced leukaemogenic potential. In vitro, in erythroblasts transformed at 35 degrees C, haemoglobin synthesis can be induced by a shift to 41 degrees C. This indicates that the continuous expression of a viral gene product is necessary to maintain the undifferentiated state of the virus-transformed leukaemia cells.
Type I interferons (IFN-I) are important cytokines linking innate and adaptive immunity. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells make high levels of IFN-I in response to viral infection and are thought to be the major source of the cytokines in vivo. Here, we show that conventional non-plasmacytoid dendritic cells taken from mice infected with a dendritic-cell-tropic strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus make similarly high levels of IFN-I on subsequent culture. Similarly, non-plasmacytoid dendritic cells secrete high levels of IFN-I in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a major viral signature, when the latter is introduced into the cytoplasm to mimic direct viral infection. This response is partially dependent on the cytosolic dsRNA-binding enzyme protein kinase R and does not require signalling through toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, a surface receptor for dsRNA. Furthermore, we show that sequestration of dsRNA by viral NS1 (refs 6, 7) explains the inability of conventional dendritic cells to produce IFN-I on infection with influenza. Our results suggest that multiple dendritic cell types, not just plasmacytoid cells, can act as specialized interferon-producing cells in certain viral infections, and reveal the existence of a TLR-independent pathway for dendritic cell activation that can be the target of viral interference.
We have shown previously that Drosophila cells contain virus-like particles (VLPs) containing 5-kilobase (kb) RNA that hybridizes to a transposable element, termed copia. We have suggested that VLPs and copia are derivatives of viral particles and proviral forms, respectively, of 'copia' retrovirus, a putative Drosophila retrovirus. To further clarify the relationship between copia and copia-related RNA in VLPs (VLP H-RNA), we determined and compared their nucleotide sequences. VLP H-RNA was found to be an unspliced, genome-sized transcript of copia, and, like retroviral genome RNA, VLP H-RNA is terminally redundant with termini localized in the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of copia. VLP H-RNA contains two long open reading frames (ORFs), one of which includes the coding sequence for a predominant VLP protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 31,000 (31K). Here we show that, in contrast to 17.6 ORF2, ORFs of copia have no extensive amino-acid sequence homology to the RT region of the reverse transcriptase of retrovirus in vertebrates. Because of a one-base insertion/deletion, the two ORFs in VLP H-RNA are fused and become a single, longer ORF in a genomic copia.
Hepatitis B is a widespread viral disease. In the absence of cell cultures capable of propagating the virus (HBV) an efficient vaccine has been prepared from viral envelopes isolated from the plasma of chronic carriers. The major polypeptide of the envelope is one of molecular weight 25,000 which carries the surface antigen (HBsAg). Therefore, the biosynthesis of this polypeptide in Escherichia coli may offer an alternative procedure to produce HbsAg free from human proteins. Recently, the HBV genome has been cloned in E.coli. Determination of its primary structure allowed the localization of the gene (called gene S) coding for HBsAg and the synthesis of the core antigen in E.coli has been reported. We have constructed a derivative of bacteriophage lambda carrying a fusion between the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) and the HBsAg coding sequence (lambdalacHBs-1). Infection of E.coli with lambdalacHBs-1 leads to the biosynthesis of a polypeptide of molecular weitht 138,000 carrying antigenic determinants of HBV surface antigen.
The transforming genes of acutely transforming retroviruses are derived from conserved cellular genes (c-onc genes) which are believed to be important in normal cell growth and differentiation. Recent studies indicate that altered expression of c-onc genes, for example, by insertion of viral genomes, gene amplification or chromosomal translocation, can lead to development of malignant diseases in man and animals. c-myb and c-fes are homologues of the transforming genes of avian myeloblastosis virus and feline sarcoma virus (Gardner and Snyder-Theilen strains), respectively. c-myb is transcribed preferentially in immature haematopoietic cells and probably codes for a protein important in differentiation of these cells. The viral fes gene, like several other viral onc genes, encodes a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. However, c-fes transcripts have not been detected in the types of human cells examined so far. c-myb and c-fes have been assigned to human chromosomes 6 and 15, respectively. Specific aberrations involving these chromosomes have been observed at high frequency in several human neoplasms. We have now sublocalized c-myb to 6q22-24 and c-fes to 15q25-26 by in situ hybridization of the human c-onc probes to human mitotic chromosome preparations. These chromosomal segments are indeed involved in nonrandom translocations in several human tumours. The results encourage further investigation into the role of onc genes in the pathogenesis of specific neoplasms.
A modified polyoma virus genome has been constructed which can encode the middle-T protein, but not the large-T or small-T proteins. This was achieved, starting with the full length viral DNA inserted into a plasmid vector, by replacing a small genomic restriction fragment spanning the middle-T intervening sequence with the equivalent fragment from a cloned partial cDNA copy of the middle-T protein mRNA. Transfection of the modified viral DNA into cultured rat cells efficiently induced the formation of transformed cell foci which gave rise to cell lines that grew as tumours after injection into Fisher rats. The only viral early-region antigen synthesized by the cell lines was the middle-T protein. Expression of the middle-t protein is therefore sufficient to establish and maintain a transformed state. The viral mRNA produced by two of the transformed cell lines was structurally indistinguishable from the normal middle-T mRNA found in productively infected cells, suggesting that RNA splicing is not an essential step in the biogenesis of this messenger.
Mice carrying mutations at the W locus located on chromosome 5 are characterized by severe macrocytic anaemia, lack of hair pigmentation and sterility. Mutations at this locus appear to affect the proliferation and/or migration of cells during early embryogenesis and result in an intrinsic defect in the haematopoietic stem cell hierarchy. An understanding of the molecular basis of the complex and pleiotropic phenotype in W mutant mice would thus provide insights into the important developmental processes of gametogenesis, melanogenesis and haematopoiesis. Here we show that the mouse mutant W has a deletion of the c-kit proto-oncogene. Interspecific backcross analysis demonstrates that the W locus is very tightly linked to c-kit and that the two loci cannot be segregated at this level of analysis. c-kit is the cellular homologue of the oncogene v-kit of the HZ4 feline sarcoma virus and encodes a transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase receptor that is structurally similar to the receptors for colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and platelet derived growth factor. The co-localization of c-kit with W provides a molecular entry into this important region of the mouse genome. In addition, these observations provide the first example of a germ-line mutation in a mammalian proto-oncogene and implicate the c-kit gene as a candidate for the W locus.
The hammerhead ribozyme was originally discovered in a group of RNAs associated with plant viruses, and has subsequently been identified in the genome of the newt (Notophthalamus viridescens), in schistosomes and in cave crickets (Dolichopoda species). The sporadic occurrence of this self-cleaving RNA motif in highly divergent organisms could be a consequence of the very early evolution of the hammerhead ribozyme, with all extant examples being descended from a single ancestral progenitor. Alternatively, the hammerhead ribozyme may have evolved independently many times. To better understand the observed distribution of hammerhead ribozymes, we used in vitro selection to search an unbiased sample of random sequences for comparably active self-cleaving motifs. Here we show that, under near-physiological conditions, the hammerhead ribozyme motif is the most common (and thus the simplest) RNA structure capable of self-cleavage at biologically observed rates. Our results suggest that the evolutionary process may have been channelled, in nature as in the laboratory, towards repeated selection of the simplest solution to a biochemical problem.
Reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) from neuronal latency is a common and potentially devastating cause of disease worldwide. CD8+ T cells can completely inhibit HSV reactivation in mice, with interferon-gamma affording a portion of this protection. We found that CD8+ T cell lytic granules are also required for the maintenance of neuronal latency both in vivo and in ex vivo ganglia cultures and that their directed release to the junction with neurons in latently infected ganglia did not induce neuronal apoptosis. Here, we describe a nonlethal mechanism of viral inactivation in which the lytic granule component, granzyme B, degrades the HSV-1 immediate early protein, ICP4, which is essential for further viral gene expression.
The carcinogenic process is extremely complex and is affected by diverse environmental and host factors. The mechanism for the gradual development of the transformed phenotype (a process termed "progression") was studied in type 5 adenovirus (Ad5)-transformed rat embryo cells. Progression was not correlated with major changes in the pattern of integration of viral DNA sequences. Instead, it was associated with an increased methylation of integrated viral sequences other than those corresponding to the E1 transforming genes of Ad5. A single exposure of progressed cells to the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (Aza) resulted in a stable reversion to the unprogressed state of the original parental clone. A further selection of cells after growth in agar allowed the isolation of Aza-treated clones that had regained the progressed phenotype. These observations indicate that progression is a reversible process and suggest that progression may be associated with changes in the state of methylation of one or more specific genes.
We examine the role of electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals' attraction in determining interviral spacings in 'equilibrium' gels of tobacco mosaic virus. The observed spacings are inconsistent with a force-balance model. Experimental probes of the role of forces are suggested.
The cellular protein p107 and the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) have many features in common. Most strikingly, they contain homologous protein domains that mediate interaction with the oncoproteins of several small DNA tumour viruses, including adenovirus E1A and SV40 large-T antigen. In cells that do not contain these viral oncoproteins, pRB interacts with the cellular transcription factor E2F or a related protein termed DRTF1. E2F associates with a form of pRB that is found primarily in G1 cells. It seems that the E2F-pRB complex dissociates near the G1-S boundary before the initiation of S phase, releasing free E2F and apparently stimulating the ability of E2F to activate transcription. Cells that express E1A have no or little pRB-E2F complex, presumably because of the association of E1A with pRB. During S phase, E2F forms a second complex that contains cyclin A but apparently lacks pRB. Here, we report that p107 is found in the cyclin A/E2F complex and that this complex also contains p33cdk2. These observations suggest that p107 and pRB cooperate in the regulation of E2F activity, each affecting different stages of the cell cycle. Thus, by binding to pRB and p107, E1A and large-T antigen target two distinct aspects of E2F regulation.
Cells of embryos of the high leukemic mouse strain AKR can be grown in culture as virus-negative cell lines. However, these lines and clonal sublines uniformly have the capacity to initiate synthesis of murine leukemia virus. Exposure of the cells to 5-iododeoxyuridine or 5-bromodeoxyuridine induced synthesis of virus in as high as 0.1 to 0.5 percent of the cells; many of the cells were producing virus as soon as 3 days after initiation of treatment. Induction of virus by these drugs is several orders of magnitude greater than that obtained with any other treatment tested. These studies indicate that the full genome of murine leukemia virus is present in an unexpressed form in all AKR cells and provide a potentially powerful technique for activating leukemia virus genomes in other cell systems.
Nucleic acid hybridization techniques have contributed significantly to the understanding of gene organization, regulation and expression. In the context of persistent or latent viral infections, hybridization with specific labelled probes represents the most sensitive assay presently available for detection of viral genomes. During the course of persistence, viral genomes may exist in multiple and yet quite segregated areas in an infected host, but examination of all tissues remains difficult and time-consuming. At present, the application of hybridization assays to in vivo infections requires either chemical extraction of nucleic acid coupled with dot-blot and gel transfer techniques or in situ hybridization to cryostat tissue sections. In both cases, selected tissues must be removed by dissection before analysis. We describe here a procedure which allows efficient and reproducible screening of all tissue in an infected host. Our technique allows detection of viral genetic material in whole-body sections of infected mice, and provides the first evidence in vivo for accumulation of viral genetic material with a parallel decrease in infectious virus during persistent virus infection. This technique should be widely applicable to studies of developmental regulation of gene expression, for monitoring locations of gene expression in transgenic mice and for analysis of molecular mechanisms in pathogenesis.
Viruses have been shown to cause bone marrow aplasia in animals and have been implicated in bone marrow failure in man; however, until recently, a specific link between human viral infection and bone marrow failure has not been proven. In 1975 Cossart and colleagues found a serum parvovirus-like virus (SPLV, sometimes referred to as B19) in human serum. Antibody to this virus is present in the sera of 30-45% of healthy adults (Y. E. Cossart, P. P. Mortimer, unpublished observations). However, evidence for a direct link came from work by Pattison et al. who found five children with transient aplastic crisis of sickle cell disease and evidence of active infection with SPLV. This association was later confirmed in a large series of children with sickle cell disease and aplastic crisis in Jamaica. We have studied the effects of virus-containing material on haematopoiesis, using in vitro colony-forming assays to look for direct evidence for a role of SPLV in bone marrow aplasia. We show here that SPLV-containing sera inhibit erythropoiesis in culture. Moreover, in a child with hereditary spherocytosis who developed transient aplastic crisis, a strong inhibitory effect of the patient's serum on erythropoiesis correlated with the presence of virus.
Type C sarcoma viruses are genetic recombinants containing portions of replication-competent helper viruses linked to sarcoma virus-specific sequences (generically designated onc genes) which are thought to be required for acute fibroblast transformation. The onc elements of different avian and mammalian sarcoma viral isolates are each homologous to subsets of cellular DNA sequences which have no well-defined role in normal cells. Because of the lack of significant homology between helper viral genes and cellular onc sequences, the recombinational mechanisms which facilitate the formation of sarcoma viral genomes remain unclear. In Moloney murine sarcoma virus, viral onc (or v-mos) and cellular onc (or c-mos) sequences exhibit complete and uninterrupted homology as determined by heteroduplex and restriction enzyme analyses of molecularly cloned DNA. By contrast, the cellular counterparts of the onc elements of Rous sarcoma virus (G. Cooper and R. Parker, personal communication), avian erythroblastosis virus (B. Vennstrom, personal communication), Abelson leukaemia virus (D. Baltimore, personal communication), Harvey sarcoma virus (E. Scolnick, personal communication) and simian sarcoma virus (R. Gallo, personal communication) are now known to contain intervening sequences which do not appear in the respective viral genomes. Here we report the use of the Southern blot technique to examine cat cellular DNA sequences (c-fes) homologous to the onc gene (v-fes) of Snyder-Theilen feline sarcoma virus (ST-FeSV). We used cloned DNA 'probes' containing defined portions of the ST-FeSV genome to show that v-fes sequences originate from at least four noncontiguous sequences in cat cellular DNA, separated from each other by intervening sequences.
The pathogenesis of infection of mice by the mammalian reoviruses involves several discrete steps. Each of the three viral outer capsid proteins has a highly distinct and specialized role: one protein (sigma 1) binds to cell surface receptors; a second protein (mu 1C) determines the capacity for viral growth at mucosal surfaces; and the third protein (sigma 3) is responsible for inhibiting cell macromolecular synthesis. A detailed picture of the molecular basis of reovirus virulence and attention is now emerging.
Several human and animal Ebola outbreaks have occurred over the past 4 years in Gabon and the Republic of Congo. The human outbreaks consisted of multiple simultaneous epidemics caused by different viral strains, and each epidemic resulted from the handling of a distinct gorilla, chimpanzee, or duiker carcass. These animal populations declined markedly during human Ebola outbreaks, apparently as a result of Ebola infection. Recovered carcasses were infected by a variety of Ebola strains, suggesting that Ebola outbreaks in great apes result from multiple virus introductions from the natural host. Surveillance of animal mortality may help to predict and prevent human Ebola outbreaks.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (approximately 22-nucleotide) RNAs that in lower organisms serve important regulatory roles in development and gene expression, typically by forming imperfect duplexes with target messenger RNAs. miRNAs have also been described in mammalian cells and in infections with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but the function of most of them is unknown. Although one EBV miRNA probably altered the processing of a viral mRNA, the regulatory significance of this event is uncertain, because other transcripts exist that can supply the targeted function. Here we report the identification of miRNAs encoded by simian virus 40 (SV40) and define their functional significance for viral infection. SVmiRNAs accumulate at late times in infection, are perfectly complementary to early viral mRNAs, and target those mRNAs for cleavage. This reduces the expression of viral T antigens but does not reduce the yield of infectious virus relative to that generated by a mutant lacking SVmiRNAs. However, wild-type SV40-infected cells are less sensitive than the mutant to lysis by cytotoxic T cells, and trigger less cytokine production by such cells. Thus, viral evolution has taken advantage of the miRNA pathway to generate effectors that enhance the probability of successful infection.
The genome of the small human virus serologically associated with erythrocyte aplasia and erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) is shown to be a linear, nonpermuted, single-stranded DNA molecule with self-priming hairpin termini, properties which are characteristic of the genomes of the family Parvoviridae. This human parvovirus chromosome was molecularly cloned into bacterial plasmid vectors and the cloned DNA was used to explore its relatedness to other mammalian parvovirus serotypes by DNA:DNA hybridization. It is not related to the human adeno-associated viruses but does show a distant evolutionary relationship to genomes of the helper-independent parvoviruses of rodents. This strongly suggests that it is an autonomous parvovirus, and as such is the first example of a member of this group of common animal pathogens to cause disease in man.
Understanding why some people establish and maintain effective control of HIV-1 and others do not is a priority in the effort to develop new treatments for HIV/AIDS. Using a whole-genome association strategy, we identified polymorphisms that explain nearly 15% of the variation among individuals in viral load during the asymptomatic set-point period of infection. One of these is found within an endogenous retroviral element and is associated with major histocompatibility allele human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*5701, whereas a second is located near the HLA-C gene. An additional analysis of the time to HIV disease progression implicated two genes, one of which encodes an RNA polymerase I subunit. These findings emphasize the importance of studying human genetic variation as a guide to combating infectious agents.
In view of the current interest in in vivo murine models for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the interaction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-related retroviruses was investigated with a human leukemic T cell line (PF-382x) that acquired xenotropic MuLV (X-MuLV) after in vivo passage in immunosuppressed mice. Despite similar levels of membrane CD4 expression and HIV-1 125I-labeled gp 120 binding, a dramatic acceleration in the time course of HIV-1 infection was observed in PF-382x compared to its X-MuLV-negative counterpart (PF-382). Moreover, PF-382 cells coinfected by X-MuLV and HIV-1 generated a progeny of phenotypically mixed viral particles, enabling HIV-1 to productively infect a panel of CD4- human cells, including B lymphoid cells and purified normal peripheral blood CD4-/CD8+ T lymphocytes. Mixed viral phenotypes were also produced by human CD4+ T cells coinfected with an amphotropic MuLV-related retrovirus (A-MuLV) and HIV-1. These data show that endogenous MuLV acquired by human cells transplanted into mice can significantly interact with HIV-1, thereby inducing important alterations of HIV-1 biological properties.
Host animals show an immune response to the surface of cells infected with RNA tumour viruses. An element of this response is due to expression of viral structural antigens, but the major part is due to virus-induced cell-surface antigens (CSAs). This article compares the properties of CSAs of the avian, murine and feline retrovirus systems.
Only two avian oncogenic viruses specifically cause acute leukaemias yet do not transform chicken fibroblasts in culture: E26, which causes erythroblastosis and a low level of concomitant myeloblastosis in chickens, and avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV), which causes myeloblastosis exclusively. Both viruses are replication-defective and share a sequence termed myb (also known as amv) which is unrelated to essential virion genes and is therefore thought to be part of the transforming onc genes of these viruses. However, the genetic structure of the two viruses differs. E26 has a genomic RNA of 5.7 kilobases (kb) and encodes a 135,000 molecular weight gag-related protein (p135) with probable transforming function. We show here by in vitro translation that the 5.7-kb E26 RNA directs the synthesis of p135. Oligonucleotide analysis indicates that E26 RNA contains an internal 0.8-kb subset of the 1.2-kb AMV-related sequence (mybA), termed mybE. A 2.46-kb molecular clone prepared from cDNA transcribed in vitro from E26 RNA contained an E26 transformation-specific (ets) sequence flanked by mybE and an env-related sequence. A complete DNA sequence of this clone indicates that the 1.5-kb ets sequence extends the open reading frame of mybE for 491 amino acids. Thus, the p135 gene of E26 is a genetic hybrid of three distinct elements, approximately 1.2 kb derived from the 5' region of the retroviral gag gene, mybE and the ets sequence, linked in the order 5'-delta gag-mybE-ets-3'. The myeloid leukaemogenicity shared by E26 and AMV correlates with the common myb sequence, while the distinct erythroid leukaemogenicity of E26 correlates with ets and the E26-specific linkage of myb to delta gag.
The blue-green algal virus LPP-1 was concentrated by ultrafiltration and purified by density-gradient and differential centrifugation. The virus contains DNA and has a sedimentation coefficient of 548S. Electron micrographs of purified viral preparations show that the polyhedral particles have short tails, which are approximately one-fourth as long as the diameter of the head. Data presented in this report indicate that the blue-green algal virus more closely resembles bacteriophages than viruses infecting higher plants.
Microbes rely on diverse defense mechanisms that allow them to withstand viral predation and exposure to invading nucleic acid. In many Bacteria and most Archaea, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) form peculiar genetic loci, which provide acquired immunity against viruses and plasmids by targeting nucleic acid in a sequence-specific manner. These hypervariable loci take up genetic material from invasive elements and build up inheritable DNA-encoded immunity over time. Conversely, viruses have devised mutational escape strategies that allow them to circumvent the CRISPR/Cas system, albeit at a cost. CRISPR features may be exploited for typing purposes, epidemiological studies, host-virus ecological surveys, building specific immunity against undesirable genetic elements, and enhancing viral resistance in domesticated microbes.
Avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) induces both erythroblastosis and fibrosarcoma in chickens. The viral oncogene responsible for these diseases, erb, is divided into two regions, erb-A and erb-B, although recent evidence suggests that it is primarily the erb-B gene product that is responsible for the transforming activity. The erb-B gene product has been reported previously to be a membrane glycoprotein of 68,000 molecular weight (MW), gp68erb -B. However, we show here that gp68erb -B is an intracellular precursor which is modified further to a 74,000 MW protein, gp74erb -B. By the criteria of resistance to digestion with endoglycosidase H, subcellular fractionation and inhibition of biosynthesis by the ionophore monensin, gp74erb -B appears to be located at the cell surface. Recently, a comparison of the erb-B sequence with that of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor has shown that these two genes are highly homologous, and that erb-B appears to represent a truncated form of this growth factor. In light of these data the identification of gp74erb -B at the plasma membrane suggests that this may be the functionally important form of the erb-B gene product.
Binding of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to infectable host cells, such as B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and colorectal cells, is mediated by a high-affinity interaction between the gp120 component of the viral envelope glycoprotein and the CD4 receptor. Upon binding, it is thought that the second component of the envelope, gp41, mediates fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes. However, the early steps of HIV infection have not yet been thoroughly elucidated. Viral entry was first reported to be mediated by pH-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis; subsequent studies have shown entry to be pH-independent. Although direct fusion of virus to plasma membranes of infected cells has been observed by electron microscopy, it is still formally possible that the infectious path of the virus involves receptor-mediated endocytosis. To gain a better understanding of receptor function in viral entry, we have analysed the ability of several altered or truncated forms of CD4 to serve as effective viral receptors. Our results indicate that domains beyond the HIV-binding region of CD4 are not required for viral infection. Some of the altered forms of CD4 that serve as effective HIV receptors are severely impaired in their ability to be endocytosed. These experiments therefore support the notion that viral fusion to the plasma membrane is sufficient for infection.
Observations of individual virions in live cells have led to the characterization of their attachment, entry and intracellular transport. However, the assembly of individual virions has never been observed in real time. Insights into this process have come primarily from biochemical analyses of populations of virions or from microscopic studies of fixed infected cells. Thus, some assembly properties, such as kinetics and location, are either unknown or controversial. Here we describe quantitatively the genesis of individual virions in real time, from initiation of assembly to budding and release. We studied fluorescently tagged derivatives of Gag, the major structural component of HIV-1-which is sufficient to drive the assembly of virus-like particles-with the use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and total-internal-reflection fluorescent microscopy in living cells. Virions appeared individually at the plasma membrane, their assembly rate accelerated as Gag protein accumulated in cells, and typically 5-6 min was required to complete the assembly of a single virion. These approaches allow a previously unobserved view of the genesis of individual virions and the determination of parameters of viral assembly that are inaccessible with conventional techniques.
The comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis of intraviral protein interactions in two members of the herpesvirus family, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), revealed 123 and 173 interactions, respectively. Viral protein interaction networks resemble single, highly coupled modules, whereas cellular networks are organized in separate functional submodules. Predicted and experimentally verified interactions between KSHV and human proteins were used to connect the viral interactome into a prototypical human interactome and to simulate infection. The analysis of the combined system showed that the viral network adopts cellular network features and that protein networks of herpesviruses and possibly other intracellular pathogens have distinguishing topologies.
The bacteriophage T5 DNA fragments retained by a population of blended early complexes, formed under conditions of limited viral DNA transfer to host cells, appear to include only one of six tested cistrons. When complexes harboring wild-type fragments are infected with appropriate amber mutants, recombination occurs but apparently is not needed for productive infection.
Comparison of HTLV-III, the putative AIDS virus, with other related viruses, may help to reveal more about the origin of AIDS in humans. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the gag and pol genes of an equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) proviral DNA clone was determined. The sequence was compared with that of HTLV-III and of visna, a pathogenic lentivirus of sheep. The results show that these viruses constitute a family clearly distinct from that of the type C viruses or the BLV-HTLV-I and -II group. Within the family, EIAV, HTLV-III, and visna appear to be equally divergent from a common evolutionary ancestor.
Studies of tumor cell cultures with antiviral antibody showed that most of the cell-associated virus and viral antigen were found at the cell membrane and were thus accessible to the effect of neutralizing antibody. Humoral antibody present in tumor tissue neutralized cell-associated virus in vivo and thus rendered the tumor cells temporarily noninfectious. When these cells were grown in vitro in the absence of antibody, virus eventually reappeared. However, the time of reappearance, amount of virus produced, and persistence of virus in such cultures depended upon the amount of virus used to produce the tumor.
Extensive antigenic variability and a capricious epidemiology are characteristics of influenza A and B viruses of man. The haemagglutinin (HA) undergoes frequent and progressive antigenic drift as a result of selection, under immunological pressure, of viruses possessing alterations in the amino acid sequences at specific sites in the molecule. Here we present evidence for an additional selection mechanism for antigenic variants of influenza virus that depends on differing host cell tropisms of virus subpopulations. These studies were initiated after earlier observations of the occurrence of a marked degree of antigenic variation during passage of laboratory strains of influenza virus in eggs and cell cultures (J.C.J., in preparation). We have now shown that cultivation of influenza B viruses in eggs selects subpopulations which are antigenically distinct from virus from the same source grown in mammalian cell cultures. As antigenic characterization of influenza virus strains for epidemiological purposes and for the preparation of influenza vaccines conventionally relies on the cultivation of virus in eggs, our findings may have important practical implications for vaccine design and efficacy.
Lymph nodes prevent the systemic dissemination of pathogens such as viruses that infect peripheral tissues after penetrating the body's surface barriers. They are also the staging ground of adaptive immune responses to pathogen-derived antigens. It is unclear how virus particles are cleared from afferent lymph and presented to cognate B cells to induce antibody responses. Here we identify a population of CD11b+CD169+MHCII+ macrophages on the floor of the subcapsular sinus (SCS) and in the medulla of lymph nodes that capture viral particles within minutes after subcutaneous injection. Macrophages in the SCS translocated surface-bound viral particles across the SCS floor and presented them to migrating B cells in the underlying follicles. Selective depletion of these macrophages compromised local viral retention, exacerbated viraemia of the host, and impaired local B-cell activation. These findings indicate that CD169+ macrophages have a dual physiological function. They act as innate 'flypaper' by preventing the systemic spread of lymph-borne pathogens and as critical gatekeepers at the lymph-tissue interface that facilitate the recognition of particulate antigens by B cells and initiate humoral immune responses.
Electron microscopic analysis of the DNA product synthesized by detergent-disrupted preparations of Rous sarcoma virus in vitro revealed the presence of several interesting molecular forms including covalently closed circular DNA. The identification of such circular DNA indicates that virions of retroviruses contain all the components necessary to facilitate the complete synthesis of mature forms of viral DNA and therefore provide a useful system to delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in their synthesis.
Susceptibility of rodent cells to infection by ecotropic murine leukaemia viruses (MuLV) is determined by binding of the virus envelope to a membrane receptor that has multiple membrane-spanning domains. Cells infected by ecotropic MuLV synthesize envelope protein, gp70, which binds to this receptor, thereby preventing additional infections. The consequences of envelope-MuLV receptor binding for the infected host cell have not been directly determined, partly because the cellular function of the MuLV receptor protein is unknown. Here we report a coincidence in the positions of the first eight putative membrane-spanning domains found in the virus receptor and in two related proteins, the arginine and histidine permeases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. 1), but not in any other proteins identified by computer-based sequence comparison of the GenBank data base. Xenopus oocytes injected with receptor-encoding messenger RNA show increased uptake of L-arginine, L-lysine and L-ornithine. The transport properties and the expression pattern of the virus receptor behave in ways previously attributed to y+, the principal transporter of cationic L-amino acids in mammalian cells.
Dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, the most severe responses to dengue virus (DV) infection, are characterized by plasma leakage (due to increased vascular permeability) and low platelet counts. CLEC5A (C-type lectin domain family 5, member A; also known as myeloid DAP12-associating lectin (MDL-1)) contains a C-type lectin-like fold similar to the natural-killer T-cell C-type lectin domains and associates with a 12-kDa DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) on myeloid cells. Here we show that CLEC5A interacts with the dengue virion directly and thereby brings about DAP12 phosphorylation. The CLEC5A-DV interaction does not result in viral entry but stimulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Blockade of CLEC5A-DV interaction suppresses the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines without affecting the release of interferon-alpha, supporting the notion that CLEC5A acts as a signalling receptor for proinflammatory cytokine release. Moreover, anti-CLEC5A monoclonal antibodies inhibit DV-induced plasma leakage, as well as subcutaneous and vital-organ haemorrhaging, and reduce the mortality of DV infection by about 50% in STAT1-deficient mice. Our observation that blockade of CLEC5A-mediated signalling attenuates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages infected with DV (either alone or complexed with an enhancing antibody) offers a promising strategy for alleviating tissue damage and increasing the survival of patients suffering from dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, and possibly even other virus-induced inflammatory diseases.
Programmed cell death is an active process of self destruction that is important in both the development and maintenance of multicellular animals. The molecular mechanisms controlling activation or suppression of programmed cell death are largely unknown. Apoptosis, a morphologically and biochemically defined type of programmed cell death commonly seen in vertebrates, was found to be initiated during baculovirus replication in insect cells. A specific viral gene product, p35, was identified as being responsible for blocking the apoptotic response. Identification of the function of this gene will allow further definition of the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of programmed cell death and may identify the role of apoptosis in invertebrate viral defense systems.
DNA of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 has been found closely associated with human genital cancer, supporting the concept that members of this virus group are key factors in the aetiology of genital cancer. HPV 18 DNA sequences were also detected in cell lines derived from cervical cancer. We have now analysed these cell lines, HeLa, C4-1 and 756, for the structural organization and transcription of the HPV 18 genome and we find that the HPV 18 DNA is integrated into the cellular genome and is amplified in HeLa and 756 cells. Almost the complete HPV 18 genome seems to be present in 756 cells, with the early region being disrupted into two portions in each integrated copy. In HeLa and C4-1 cells, a 2-3 kilobase (kb) segment of HPV 18-specific sequences is missing from the E2 to L2 region. HPV 18 sequences are specifically transcribed from the E6-E7-E1 region into poly(A)+ RNAs of 1.5-6.5 kb. Hybridization analysis of cDNA clones indicated that some of the transcripts are composed of HPV 18 and cellular sequences. In addition, poly(A)+ RNA hybridizing with HPV 16 DNA was found in two out of three cervical carcinoma biopsies.
An RNA virus, designated hepatitis G virus (HGV), was identified from the plasma of a patient with chronic hepatitis. Extension from an immunoreactive complementary DNA clone yielded the entire genome (9392 nucleotides) encoding a polyprotein of 2873 amino acids. The virus is closely related to GB virus C (GBV-C) and distantly related to hepatitis C virus, GBV-A, and GBV-B. HGV was associated with acute and chronic hepatitis. Persistent viremia was detected for up to 9 years in patients with hepatitis. The virus is transfusion-transmissible. It has a global distribution and is present within the volunteer blood donor population in the United States.
Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) is the most common form of sporadic viral encephalitis in western countries. Its pathogenesis remains unclear, as it affects otherwise healthy patients and only a small minority of HSV-1-infected individuals. Here, we elucidate a genetic etiology for HSE in two children with autosomal recessive deficiency in the intracellular protein UNC-93B, resulting in impaired cellular interferon-alpha/beta and -lambda antiviral responses. HSE can result from a single-gene immunodeficiency that does not compromise immunity to most pathogens, unlike most known primary immunodeficiencies. Other severe infectious diseases may also reflect monogenic disorders of immunity.
The virally encoded oncogenes (v-onc) of avian and mammalian retroviruses are the recombinant products of normal cellular genes (c-onc) and a retroviral genome. These cellular homologues have been highly conserved during evolution and are found in human DNA. The expression of at least one c-onc under the control of a viral promoter results in transformation of cells in a manner resembling that displayed by the v-onc counterpart; the inappropriate expression of c-onc in the absence of viral influences could likewise result in the malignant state. This proposal would be strongly supported by the presence of c-onc RNAs in a variety of human tumours were they not also demonstrable in normal tissues. The role of these RNAs in the oncogenic process remains unclear. Here we report that RNA homologous to the oncogene (v-abl) of Abelson murine leukaemia virus (A-MLV) is expressed in a unique human leukaemia in a fashion different from that of other human tissues and tumours. In addition, DNA from this tumour transforms NIH-3T3 cells at a high efficiency in a transfection assay. The transfected sequences are not related to the v-abl gene, but the NIH-3T3 transformants manufacture a transforming growth factor which behaves similarly to factors produced by A-MLV-transformed NIH-3T3 fibroblasts.
Proviruses cloned from rat cells infected with mouse mammary tumour virus, a B-type retrovirus regulated by glucocorticoid hormones, show the structural features of transposable elements: short inverted repeats conclude long direct repeats at the ends of viral DNA, and short sequences of cellular DNA are duplicated during integration and flank each provirus. The integrative mechanism joins a precise site in viral DNA to non-homologous sites in host DNA.
Nonmalignant diploid human fibroblast cells (GM3498B) derived from a skin biopsy of a patient with Bloom's syndrome have been transformed by transfection with DNA from a tumorigenic mouse cell line (Ha-8) carrying a single copy of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) genome. The transformed cell lines have an extended life-span, form colonies in agarose, and proliferate in nude mice--characteristics of neoplastic transformation. Like the parental cells, they also exhibit a high spontaneous level of sister chromatid exchanges. Finally, the transformed cells contain most, if not all, of the Ha-MuSV genome as well as the human rasH sequence. These experiments show that these diploid nonmalignant human cells can be used as recipients in transfection experiments for studying the genetic control of neoplastic transformation.
The salient features of this model for oncornavirus assembly are that uncleaved precursor molecules to the internal virus polypeptides possess specific recognition sites both for viral envelope constituents already inserted in the cell membrane and for the viral RNA. After orderly alignment of these components at the budding site, virus maturation proceeds through specific proteolytic cleavage of the precursor components and association of the resultant molecules into the characteristic type C virion substructures revealed by electron microscopy.
Analysis of the organization and nucleotide sequence of two human loci related to the transforming gene of Kirsten murine sarcoma virus establishes one as a functional gene and the other as a processed pseudogene. The two final coding exons of the functional gene seem to have arisen by duplication. Differentially spliced mRNAs incorporating one or other of the duplicated exons probably served as the intermediates by which the viral transforming gene and the pseudogene were generated. This suggests that the functional gene may specify either of two related polypeptides depending on the pattern of RNA splicing.
The crystallographically determined structure of a soluble fragment from the major envelope protein of a flavivirus reveals an unusual architecture. The flat, elongated dimer extends in a direction that would be parallel to the viral membrane. Residues that influence binding of monoclonal antibodies lie on the outward-facing surface of the protein. The clustering of mutations that affect virulence in various flaviviruses indicates a possible receptor binding site and, together with other mutational and biochemical data, suggests a picture for the fusion-activating, conformational change triggered by low pH.
Analysis of the 1,042,519-base pair Chlamydia trachomatis genome revealed unexpected features related to the complex biology of chlamydiae. Although chlamydiae lack many biosynthetic capabilities, they retain functions for performing key steps and interconversions of metabolites obtained from their mammalian host cells. Numerous potential virulence-associated proteins also were characterized. Several eukaryotic chromatin-associated domain proteins were identified, suggesting a eukaryotic-like mechanism for chlamydial nucleoid condensation and decondensation. The phylogenetic mosaic of chlamydial genes, including a large number of genes with phylogenetic origins from eukaryotes, implies a complex evolution for adaptation to obligate intracellular parasitism.
The production and nature of alkaline phosphatase were studied in Epstein-Barr viral nuclear antigen-positive, surface membrane immunoglobulin negative-cell lines established from two patients, one with acute myeloid leukemia and one with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The acute myeloid leukemia-derived cells contained myeloid alkaline phosphatase, while the acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived cells contained lymphoid alkaline phosphatase. The presence of the myeloid-specific enzyme in a surface membrane immunoglobin--negative cell line suggests that the line is composed of myeloid precursor cells and that such cells may be susceptible to infection with Epstein-Barr virus.
The growth-promoting and/or differentiation-blocking activities of Kirsten (Ki-MSV) or Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MSV) on various types of cells in vitro are well documented. Here we report an unexpected effect of these viruses on a rat phaeochromocytoma cell line, PC12. PC12 cells, which multiply indefinitely in growth medium, are known to respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) by cessation of cell division and expression of several properties resembling those of differentiated sympathetic neurones. We have found that Ki- and Ha-MSV mimic some, if not all, of the activities of NGF in PC12 cells, and there is evidence that the viral oncogenes, v-Ki-ras and v-Ha-ras, are responsible for this phenomenon. This system may be of value for studying the mechanism of action of the v-ras genes as well as the regulatory mechanism of growth and differentiation in neuronal cells.
Cells lying on the ventricular surface of the hypothalamic ependyma of the tegu lizard exhibit the pseudopodial and flaplike processes characteristic of macrophages found elsewhere. Since they ingest latex beads, they may be considered a resident phagocytic system of the brain. The importance of ependyma and ventricular phagocytes as a first line of defense against viral invasion of the brain, as well as their role in the pathogenesis of certain virus-related diseases, is suggested by a number of experimental and clinical observations.
Interleukin-3 (multi-CSF) is a multilineage haematopoietic growth regulator that initiates the proliferation and differentiation of multipotential stem cells. Complementary DNA clones encoding interleukin-3 (IL-3) have recently been isolated and the structure of the IL-3 gene determined. IL-3 is produced by T lymphocytes or T lymphomas only after stimulation with antigens, mitogens or chemical activators such as phorbol esters. The myelomonocytic leukaemia line WEHI-3B also produces IL-3 but its production is constitutive and the WEHI-3B cells do not appear to produce significant levels of any of the other lymphokines normally secreted by T lymphocytes after stimulation. It has been proposed that the genetic change leading to the constitutive expression of IL-3 may have been a key event in the development of this leukaemia. We report here that the constitutive synthesis of IL-3 by the WEHI-3B cell line is due to the insertion of an endogenous retrovirus-like element close to the 5' end of the gene. The insertion, an intracisternal A particle (IAP) genome, is positioned with its 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) close to the promoter region of the IL-3 gene, resulting in constitutive synthesis of IL-3.
The very early stages of the human B-cell differentiation pathway are poorly understood, primarily because of the lack of appropriate permanent cell lines. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a putative human oncogenic virus which transforms human B cells in vitro into continuously proliferating cells. It has been believed that EBV transforms mature B cells, but recently, transformation of immature pre-B-cell lines has been reported, suggesting that EBV might also transform cells much earlier in the B-cell lineage. We report here the establishment of cell lines transformed by EBV at various stages of the B-cell differentiation pathway. Interestingly, two lines showed the complete absence of immunoglobulin synthesis and the lack of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement despite containing EBV genome and surface markers of B cells. Our results indicate that EBV can infect and transform cells of the B lymphocyte lineage even before immunoglobulin gene rearrangement.
Human foamy virus (HFV) is the prototype of the Spumavirus genus of Retroviridae. In all other retroviruses, the pol gene products, including reverse transcriptase, are synthesized as Gag-Pol fusion proteins and are cleaved to functional enzymes during viral budding or release. In contrast, the Pol protein of HFV is translated from a spliced messenger RNA and lacks Gag domains. Infectious HFV particles contain double-stranded DNA similar in size to full-length provirus, suggesting that reverse transcription has taken place in viral particles before new rounds of infection, reminiscent of hepadnaviruses. These data suggest that foamy viruses possess a replication pathway containing features of both retroviruses and hepadnaviruses but distinct from both.
Many questions have been posed about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pathogenesis. Is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) both necessary and sufficient to cause AIDS? Is AIDS essentially an autoimmune disease, triggering apoptosis, or is virus infection the cause of T helper lymphocyte depletion? What is the significance of HIV tropism and the role of macrophages and dendritic cells in AIDS? Is there viral latency and why is there usually a long period between infection and AIDS? Is HIV variation a crucial aspect of its pathogenesis and, if so, do virulent strains emerge? Although this article provides few definitive answers, it aims to focus commentary on salient points. Overall, it is increasingly evident that both the tropism and burden of HIV infection correlate closely with the manifestations of disease.
Virus-infected animals and those bearing various types of malignancies progressively lose the ability to respond to interferon inducers. The interferon response of virus-infected animals could be restored to normal levels when inducers were administered with certain prostaglandins. This suggests that prostaglandins may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of interferon inducers as antiviral and antineoplastic agents.
Jurkat T cell lines constitutively expressing Tax, the 40-kilodalton transactivator protein of human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), were used to investigate the mechanism by which this viral product deregulates the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha gene (IL-2R alpha, Tac). Transfection of deleted forms of the IL-2R alpha promoter and in vitro DNA-binding studies revealed that a 12-base pair promoter segment, which has homology with the binding site for NF-kappa B, was required for Tax-induced activation of the IL-2R alpha promoter in vivo. An 18-base pair oligonucleotide containing this kappa B-like regulatory element proved sufficient to confer Tax inducibility upon a heterologous promoter. DNA affinity precipitation assays showed that Tax, like mitogenic stimuli, induced the expression of the 86-kilodalton cellular protein HIVEN86A, which specifically binds to the IL-2R alpha kappa B element in vitro. Furthermore, DNA/protein cross-linking studies revealed that several polypeptides interact with this sequence motif. Thus, the deregulation of IL-2R alpha gene expression encountered in HTLV-I leukemias appears to involve Tax activation of one or more cellular proteins that are normally induced by mitogens and that directly contribute to transcriptional activation of this receptor gene.
Randomly labeled RNA's from animal cells either productively infected or transformed by polyoma virus were used to measure virus DNA transcription. During lytic infection, 50 percent of polyoma virus DNA was expressed. In two different polyoma-transformed hamster cell lines, the same 20 percent of the virus genome was transcribed. About 10 percent of polyoma DNA was expressed in the one mouse transformed cell line examined.
Our recent studies suggested that neurons and epithelial cells sort viral glycoproteins in a similar manner. The apical influenza virus haemagglutinin was preferentially delivered to the axon of hippocampal neurons in culture, whereas the basolateral vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein was sorted to the dendrites. To investigate whether other membrane proteins showed similar sorting in neurons and epithelial cells, we have analysed the localization of a glypiated (glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored) protein, Thy-1, in hippocampal neurons in culture. In MDCK and other epithelial cells, endogenous glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, as well as mutated exogenous proteins containing the GPI-attachment signal, undergo preferential delivery to the apical surface. This polarized sorting of GPI-anchored proteins has been proposed to occur by the same mechanisms as the sorting of glycolipids to the apical surface. We report here that the neuronal GPI-protein Thy-1 is present in hippocampal neurons in culture and is exclusively located on the axonal surface. This finding further strengthens our hypothesis that the mechanisms of sorting of surface components may be similar in neurons and epithelial cells.
A 172-base pair segment of DNA that is repeated several million times in the genome of the African green monkey has been characterized. Sequence analysis revealed that the many repeats of this complex unit are not all identical but represent a set of closely related segments: Sequence divergence occurs at various positions in the segment in a nonrandom manner. The uncloned segment obtained from monkey DNA is compared with a cloned segment of the same DNA which was recombined into the genome of simian virus 40 during permissive infection.
AIDS is a disorder characterized by a slow progressive impairment of immune function and by infection of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2). Our knowledge of how these viruses cause disease in man, or how the related lentiviruses (visna and equine infectious anaemia virus) cause disease in animals, is still fragmentary. In particular, the significance of genetic variation in HIV-1, occurring within populations, within individuals and over periods of time, and the mechanisms of viral persistence remain unclear. To address these issues we prepared a series of proviral clones of HIV-1 originating from a single patient and compared their biological properties. Here we show that hybrid genomes (in which the envelope region of six viral clones were separately substituted into a prototype HIV-1 genome) generated viruses with widely differing capacity to grow in human T cells, cell lines and monocytoid cultures. These data suggest that extensive biological variation exists in vivo within an infected individual and is in part determined at the level of the viral envelope.
We report a virus-based scaffold for the synthesis of single-crystal ZnS, CdS, and freestanding chemically ordered CoPt and FePt nanowires, with the means of modifying substrate specificity through standard biological methods. Peptides (selected through an evolutionary screening process) that exhibit control of composition, size, and phase during nanoparticle nucleation have been expressed on the highly ordered filamentous capsid of the M13 bacteriophage. The incorporation of specific, nucleating peptides into the generic scaffold of the M13 coat structure provides a viable template for the directed synthesis of semiconducting and magnetic materials. Removal of the viral template by means of annealing promoted oriented aggregation-based crystal growth, forming individual crystalline nanowires. The unique ability to interchange substrate-specific peptides into the linear self-assembled filamentous construct of the M13 virus introduces a material tunability that has not been seen in previous synthetic routes. Therefore, this system provides a genetic toolkit for growing and organizing nanowires from semiconducting and magnetic materials.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious cause of chronic liver disease worldwide with more than 170 million infected individuals at risk of developing significant morbidity and mortality. Current interferon-based therapies are suboptimal especially in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, and they are poorly tolerated, highlighting the unmet medical need for new therapeutics. The HCV-encoded NS3 protease is essential for viral replication and has long been considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in HCV-infected patients. Here we identify a class of specific and potent NS3 protease inhibitors and report the evaluation of BILN 2061, a small molecule inhibitor biologically available through oral ingestion and the first of its class in human trials. Administration of BILN 2061 to patients infected with HCV genotype 1 for 2 days resulted in an impressive reduction of HCV RNA plasma levels, and established proof-of-concept in humans for an HCV NS3 protease inhibitor. Our results further illustrate the potential of the viral-enzyme-targeted drug discovery approach for the development of new HCV therapeutics.
A retroviral expression vector (N2) containing the selectable gene, neoR, has been used to determine the optimal conditions for infecting murine hematopoietic progenitor cells at high efficiency. After infected bone marrow cells were introduced into lethally irradiated mice, the presence, stability, and expression of the vector DNA sequences were analyzed either in individual spleen foci 10 days later or in the blood, bone marrow, and spleens of mice 4 months later. When bone marrow cells were cultured in medium containing virus with titers of more than 10(6) colony-forming units per milliliter in the presence of purified murine interleukin-3, more than 85 percent of the resulting foci contained vector DNA. This proviral vector DNA was intact. Efficient expression of the neoR gene was demonstrated in most of the DNA-positive foci examined. The spleens of reconstituted animals (over a long term) contained intact "vector DNA" and the blood and bone marrow expressed the neoR gene in some animals. Thus, a retroviral vector can be used to introduce intact exogenous DNA sequences into hematopoietic stem cells with high efficiency and with substantial expression.
Several independent isoltes of feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) have been described. Such viruses are apparently derived by genetic recombination between feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) genomic RNA and host cellular genetic sequences with transforming potential. Two FeSV isolates, one originally described by Gardner and the second by Snyder-Theilen, have been shown to encode polyproteins of around 115,000 molecular weight. Both polyproteins contain FeLV structural components (p15, p12) at their amino terminus in addition to nonstructural carboxyl terminal components encoded by acquired sequences within the FeSV genome. We have previously shown that Gardner FeSV P115 contains multiple sites of phosphorylation within its nonstructural component and possesses an associated protein kinase activity. In the present study we describe the expression in cells derived from a number of mammalian species, of a highly conserved celklular phosphoprotein with binding affinity for Gardner FeSV P115. This protein, designated P150, exhibits an associated protein kinase activity and is immunologically and structurally distinct from polyproteins encoded by the Gardner or Snyder-Theilen strains of FeSV.
The innate immune system senses nucleic acids by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors. RNA is sensed by Toll-like receptor members TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, or by the RNA helicases RIG-I (also known as DDX58) and MDA-5 (IFIH1). Little is known about sensors for cytoplasmic DNA that trigger antiviral and/or inflammatory responses. The best characterized of these responses involves activation of the TANK-binding kinase (TBK1)-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signalling axis to trigger transcriptional induction of type I interferon genes. A second, less well-defined pathway leads to the activation of an 'inflammasome' that, via caspase-1, controls the catalytic cleavage of the pro-forms of the cytokines IL1beta and IL18 (refs 6, 7). Using mouse and human cells, here we identify the PYHIN (pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein) family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a receptor for cytosolic DNA, which regulates caspase-1. The HIN200 domain of AIM2 binds to DNA, whereas the pyrin domain (but not that of the other PYHIN family members) associates with the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain) to activate both NF-kappaB and caspase-1. Knockdown of Aim2 abrogates caspase-1 activation in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA and the double-stranded DNA vaccinia virus. Collectively, these observations identify AIM2 as a new receptor for cytoplasmic DNA, which forms an inflammasome with the ligand and ASC to activate caspase-1.
The genomes of many (+)-stranded RNA viruses, including plant viruses and alphaviruses, consist of polycistronic RNAs whose internal genes are expressed via subgenomic messenger RNAs. The mechanism(s) by which these subgenomic mRNAs arise are poorly understood. Based on indirect evidence, three models have been proposed: (1) internal initiation by the replicase on the (-)-strand of genomic RNA, (2) premature termination during (-)-strand synthesis, followed by independent replication of the subgenomic RNA and (3) processing by nuclease cleavage of genome-length RNA. Using an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replicase) preparation from barley leaves infected with brome mosaic virus (BMV) to synthesize the viral subgenomic RNA in vitro, we now provide evidence that subgenomic RNA arises by internal initiation on the (-)-strand of genomic RNA. We believe that this also represents the first in vitro demonstration of a replicase from a eukaryotic (+)-stranded RNA virus capable of initiating synthesis of (+)-sense RNA.
The cellular innate immune system is essential for recognizing pathogen infection and for establishing effective host defence. But critical molecular determinants responsible for facilitating an appropriate immune response-following infection with DNA and RNA viruses, for example-remain to be identified. Here we report the identification, following expression cloning, of a molecule (STING; stimulator of interferon genes) that appears essential for effective innate immune signalling processes. It comprises five putative transmembrane regions, predominantly resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and is able to activate both NF-kappaB and IRF3 transcription pathways to induce expression of type I interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta ) and exert a potent anti-viral state following expression. In contrast, loss of STING rendered murine embryonic fibroblasts extremely susceptible to negative-stranded virus infection, including vesicular stomatitis virus. Further, STING ablation abrogated the ability of intracellular B-form DNA, as well as members of the herpesvirus family, to induce IFN-beta, but did not significantly affect the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that STING interacts with RIG-I and with SSR2 (also known as TRAPbeta), which is a member of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex required for protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane following translation. Ablation by RNA interference of both TRAPbeta and translocon adaptor SEC61beta was subsequently found to inhibit STING's ability to stimulate expression of IFN-beta. Thus, as well as identifying a regulator of innate immune signalling, our results imply a potential role for the translocon in innate signalling pathways activated by select viruses as well as intracellular DNA.
The Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mediates the translocation of viral messenger RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In yeast, Rev can mediate the nuclear export of Rev response-element-containing RNAs. The export of Rev itself proceeds through the nuclear pore complex and requires a nuclear export signal (NES) and interaction with a cellular cofactor, the protein Rip1. Endogenous RNA export mediators that interact with Rip1 and harbour NESs are thought to exist but have yet to be identified. Here we report the characterization of a new and essential yeast protein, Gle1, which contains an NES and has a relative molecular mass of 62,000. Mutation of the NES in Gle1 prevents export of polyadenylated RNA from the nucleus. Gle1 interacts with Rip1 and the nucleoporin Nup100 and is localized predominantly at nuclear pore complexes. These properties indicate that Gle1 is an RNA-export factor and that Rev may mediate viral RNA export by mimicking the function of Gle1.
Human T-cell leukaemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus aetiologically associated with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL), tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) and possibly multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans. Three founder lines of transgenic mice containing the HTLV-1 tax gene under the control of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) have previously been shown to develop neurofibromas. Further analysis of these animals has now revealed that they also develop an exocrinopathy involving the salivary and lachrymal glands. This pathology resembles Sjogren's syndrome, a disease of presumed autoimmune aetiology, features of which are sometimes reported in HTLV-1 associated conditions. Mice with an HTLV-1 tax transgene might be a useful model for studying the development of Sjogren-syndrome-like pathology.
Viruses replicate within living cells and use the cellular machinery for the synthesis of their genome and other components. To gain access, they have evolved a variety of elegant mechanisms to deliver their genes and accessory proteins into the host cell. Many animal viruses take advantage of endocytic pathways and rely on the cell to guide them through a complex entry and uncoating program. In the dialogue between the cell and the intruder, the cell provides critical cues that allow the virus to undergo molecular transformations that lead to successful internalization, intra-cellular transport, and uncoating.
Four virus proteins similar to two human macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) chemokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) are encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) genome. vIL-6 was functional in B9 proliferation assays and primarily expressed in KSHV-infected hematopoietic cells rather than KS lesions. HIV-1 transmission studies showed that vMIP-I is similar to human MIP chemokines in its ability to inhibit replication of HIV-1 strains dependent on the CCR5 co-receptor. These viral genes may form part of the response to host defenses contributing to virus-induced neoplasia and may have relevance to KSHV and HIV-I interactions.
In several bursal lymphoma cell lines in which c-myc transcription is regulated by avian leukosis virus (ALV) long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences, protein synthesis inhibition decreases the transcriptional activity of c-myc as well as other LTR driven viral genes. This decrease in transcription is associated with a change in the chromatin structure of c-myc, as measured by deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) hypersensitivity, and a shift of transcription from the LTR to the normal c-myc promoter. In contrast, cycloheximide had little or no effect on the transcription of LTR driven genes in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts treated with the drug. These results suggest that a labile, cell type-specific protein may interact with the retroviral LTR and regulate transcription of genes under LTR control. Further, the results demonstrate that the increase in intracellular concentration of c-myc RNA induced by cycloheximide treatment of normal cells is the result of stabilization of this message.
We describe the efficacy of L-870812, an inhibitor of HIV-1 and SIV integrase, in rhesus macaques infected with the simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) 89.6P. When initiated before CD4 cell depletion, L-870812 therapy mediated a sustained suppression of viremia, preserving CD4 levels and permitting the induction of virus-specific cellular immunity. L-870812 was also active in chronic infection; however, the magnitude and durability of the effect varied in conjunction with the pretreatment immune response and viral load. These studies demonstrate integrase inhibitor activity in vivo and suggest that cellular immunity facilitates chemotherapeutic efficacy in retroviral infections.
Promonocytic (U1) and T lymphocytic (ACH-2) cell lines chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) constitutively express low levels of virus, but expression can be induced by phorbol esters and cytokines. Whereas ACH-2 cells produce infectious virions, U1 cells produce defective, noninfectious particles. Although 3'-azido-3'-deoxythimidine (AZT) prevented acute HIV infection of susceptible cells, it did not prevent the induction of HIV expression in the infected cell lines. In contrast, interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) inhibited the release of reverse transcriptase and viral antigens into the culture supernatant after phorbol ester stimulation of both cell lines. Further, IFN-alpha suppressed the production or release (or both) of whole HIV virions, but had no effect on the amount of cell-associated viral proteins. Also, after phorbol ester stimulation of ACH-2 cells, IFN-alpha reduced the number of infectious viral particles secreted into the culture supernatant, but had no effect on the infectivity of cell-associated virus. These findings lend support to the combined use of antiviral agents that have action at both the early (AZT) and the late (IFN-alpha) stages of HIV replication.
Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has dramatically increased the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in subSaharan Africa, where up to 60% of TB patients are coinfected with HIV and each year 200,000 TB deaths are attributable to HIV coinfection. Now HIV threatens control of TB in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs can prevent TB by preserving immunity, but cohort analysis shows that early therapy, plus high levels of coverage and compliance, will be needed to avert a significant fraction of TB cases. However, ARV drugs could enhance the treatment of TB, and TB programs provide an important entry point for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
The cascade of events that leads to vaccinia-induced actin polymerization requires Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the viral membrane protein A36R. We found that a localized outside-in signaling cascade induced by the viral membrane protein B5R is required to potently activate Src and induce A36R phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. In addition, Src-mediated phosphorylation of A36R regulated the ability of virus particles to recruit and release conventional kinesin. Thus, Src activity regulates the transition between cytoplasmic microtubule transport and actin-based motility at the plasma membrane.
A puzzling property of the transcriptional activators encoded by several animal viruses is their ability to function promiscuously. The adenovirus E1a protein, for example, stimulates transcription of adenoviral genes as well as a wide variety of other viral and cellular genes. We show that E1a can interact with several classes of cellular DNA-binding domains and thereby be recruited to diverse promoters. Our results explain how a single protein can regulate transcription of multiple genes that lack a common promoter element.
There is concern that variola virus, the aetiological agent of smallpox, may be used as a biological weapon. For this reason several countries are now stockpiling (vaccinia virus-based) smallpox vaccine. Although the preventive use of smallpox vaccination has been well documented, little is known about its efficacy when used after exposure to the virus. Here we compare the effectiveness of (1) post-exposure smallpox vaccination and (2) antiviral treatment with either cidofovir (also called HPMPC or Vistide) or with a related acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue (HPMPO-DAPy) after lethal intratracheal infection of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) with monkeypox virus (MPXV). MPXV causes a disease similar to human smallpox and this animal model can be used to measure differences in the protective efficacies of classical and new-generation candidate smallpox vaccines. We show that initiation of antiviral treatment 24 h after lethal intratracheal MPXV infection, using either of the antiviral agents and applying various systemic treatment regimens, resulted in significantly reduced mortality and reduced numbers of cutaneous monkeypox lesions. In contrast, when monkeys were vaccinated 24 h after MPXV infection, using a standard human dose of a currently recommended smallpox vaccine (Elstree-RIVM), no significant reduction in mortality was observed. When antiviral therapy was terminated 13 days after infection, all surviving animals had virus-specific serum antibodies and antiviral T lymphocytes. These data show that adequate preparedness for a biological threat involving smallpox should include the possibility of treating exposed individuals with antiviral compounds such as cidofovir or other selective anti-poxvirus drugs.
Mouse cells transformed with herpes simplex virus and containing the viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene in an inactive state were treated with 5-azacytidine. The result was the reexpression of the viral TK gene. Two days of exposure to 5-azacytidine followed by 2 days of expression time was sufficient for maximal induction of the TK+ phenotype. The induction of TK expression by 5-azacytidine was concentration-dependent, with maximal induction at 10 micromoles per liter. 5-Azacytidine also inhibited the decay of TK expression in TK+ transformants removed from selective conditions. Analysis of the methylation patterns of the viral TK gene with restriction endonucleases Hpa II and Msp I showed the active gene to be unmethylated, the inactive gene methylated, and the 5-azacytidine-induced gene unmethylated.
The messenger RNAs of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) have an RNA hairpin structure, TAR, at their 5' ends that contains a six-nucleotide loop and a three-nucleotide bulge. The conformations of TAR RNA and of TAR with an arginine analog specifically bound at the binding site for the viral protein, Tat, were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Upon arginine binding, the bulge changes conformation, and essential nucleotides for binding, U23 and A27.U38, form a base-triple interaction that stabilizes arginine hydrogen bonding to G26 and phosphates. Specificity in the arginine-TAR interaction appears to be derived largely from the structure of the RNA.
Mutants of animal viruses can be isolated in bacteria by recombinant DNA methods. Since no viral functions are required for propagation of recombinants in bacteria, viral mutants with lethal changes in cis- or trans-acting elements can be isolated, as well as partially or conditionally defective mutants. In the cases of viruses with small DNA genomes, such as the tumorigenic simian virus 40 (SV40), the entire viral DNA can be inserted into the bacterial plasmid pBR322 and cloned in Escherichia coli. Recombinant plasmids with a single copy of SV40 DNA cause morphological transformation of mouse cells in culture with the same efficiency as SV40 DNA isolated from virus-infected monkey cells, but the recombinant DNA is noninfectious and replicates poorly in permissive cells. However, SV40 DNA excised from the plasmid replicates as well as authentic viral DNA and is fully infectious. SV40 mutants with small deletions or base substitutions have been isolated by in vitro site-specific or random local mutagenesis of recombinant DNA followed by cloning in E. coli. Many of the mutants thus isolated are defective in specific viral functions.
The protein Tat is encoded by the HIV-1 genome and is essential for viral replication because of its activation of viral transcription. Tat enhances the ability of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to move long distances down the DNA through a poorly understood mechanism that involves its binding the to the 5' end of the nascent HIV-1 transcript. It has been suggested that the stimulation of transcript elongation by conventional DNA-binding activators may involve phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II by the transcription factor TFIIH through the associated CAK kinase. Here we show that Tat-enhanced HIV-1 transcription in vitro requires both TFIIH and the CTD of Pol II. In addition, Tat, through its activation domain, both interacts with a functional TFIIH-containing complex and stimulates phosphorylation of a CTD-containing substrate by the TFIIH kinase. Under conditions that jointly restrict transcriptional elongation and TFIIH-mediated CTD phosphorylation, Tat stimulates both these activities. Furthermore, RNA synthesis is required for Tat to stimulate phosphorylation of the CTD when it is part of an initiation complex, as expected from Tat's interaction with viral transcripts. Thus, stimulation of Pol II elongation by Tat may involve direct effects on TFIIH-mediated CTD phosphorylation.
Because human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be transmitted as cell-free virus or as infected cells (cell-associated virus), vaccines must protect against infection by both viral forms. Vaccine-mediated protection of nonhuman primates against low doses of cell-free HIV-1, HIV-2, or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) has been demonstrated. It is now shown that multiple immunizations of chimpanzees with HIV-1 antigens protected against infection with cell-associated virus. Protection can persist for extended periods (one animal had not been exposed to viral antigens for 1 year before challenge). These results show that it is possible to elicit long-lasting protective immunity against cell-associated HIV-1.
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for conserved viral antigens can respond to different strains of virus, in contrast to antibodies, which are generally strain-specific. The generation of such CTLs in vivo usually requires endogenous expression of the antigen, as occurs in the case of virus infection. To generate a viral antigen for presentation to the immune system without the limitations of direct peptide delivery or viral vectors, plasmid DNA encoding influenza A nucleoprotein was injected into the quadriceps of BALB/c mice. This resulted in the generation of nucleoprotein-specific CTLs and protection from a subsequent challenge with a heterologous strain of influenza A virus, as measured by decreased viral lung titers, inhibition of mass loss, and increased survival.
In many retroviruses the 5' end of the pol gene codes for a protease vital for the processing of the gag polyprotein into the separate core proteins. In some viruses this protease is encoded at the 3' end of the gag gene, or between the gag and pol genes in a different reading frame to either. A sequence, Asp-Thr-Gly, which is conserved in retroviral proteases is also conserved in the active sites of aspartic proteases, an observation which has led to the suggestion that the retroviral proteases could belong to this family. We have examined the sequences of the aspartic and retroviral protease families, using pattern-recognition, structure prediction and molecular modelling techniques, and conclude that the viral protease sequences probably correspond to a single domain of an aspartic protease and may function in a dimeric form. We have constructed a model of the pol-protease of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) to test this hypothesis.
Retrovirus protease is an enzyme that cleaves gag and gag-pol precursor polyproteins into the functional proteins of mature virus particles. The correct processing of precursor polyproteins is necessary for the infectivity of virus particles: in vitro mutagenesis which introduces deletions into the murine leukaemia virus genome produces a protease-defective virus of immature core form and lacking infectivity. A therapeutic drug effective against disease caused by retrovirus proliferation could likewise interfere with virus maturation. The primary structure has so far been determined for the protease of avian myeloblastosis virus, and of murine, feline and bovine leukaemia viruses. Amino acid sequencing of the retrovirus proteases, either after their purification or from prediction from the nucleotide sequence, shows that they possess the Asp-Thr-Gly sequence characteristic of the aspartyl proteinases. In this report we show that retrovirus proteases belong to the aspartyl proteinase group and demonstrate an inhibition by the aspartyl proteinase-specific inhibitor, pepstatin A, on the activity of bovine leukaemia, Moloney murine leukaemia and human T-cell leukaemia virus proteases.
Non-enveloped virus particles (those that lack a lipid-bilayer membrane) must breach the membrane of a target host cell to gain access to its cytoplasm. So far, the molecular mechanism of this membrane penetration step has resisted structural analysis. The spike protein VP4 is a principal component in the entry apparatus of rotavirus, a non-enveloped virus that causes gastroenteritis and kills 440,000 children each year. Trypsin cleavage of VP4 primes the virus for entry by triggering a rearrangement that rigidifies the VP4 spikes. We have determined the crystal structure, at 3.2 A resolution, of the main part of VP4 that projects from the virion. The crystal structure reveals a coiled-coil stabilized trimer. Comparison of this structure with the two-fold clustered VP4 spikes in a approximately 12 A resolution image reconstruction from electron cryomicroscopy of trypsin-primed virions shows that VP4 also undergoes a second rearrangement, in which the oligomer reorganizes and each subunit folds back on itself, translocating a potential membrane-interaction peptide from one end of the spike to the other. This rearrangement resembles the conformational transitions of membrane fusion proteins of enveloped viruses.
The complementary DNA sequence encoding the cell-surface receptor for ecotropic host-range murine retroviruses (ecoR) shows that it contains 622 amino acids and 14 hydrophobic potentially membrane-spanning sequences. Because this receptor occurs on many or all murine cells and is probably essential for viability of cultured fibroblasts, its normal function might be to transport an essential metabolite. We expressed ecoR in Xenopus laevis oocytes by injecting RNA transcribed from the cloned cDNA. These oocytes specifically bound the gp70 envelope glycoprotein from an ecotropic murine leukaemia virus. An inward current was recorded electrophysiologically when a mixture of amino-acids was applied: this resulted from a stereoselective, saturable uptake of lysine, arginine and ornithine; it was independent of sodium and not substantially altered by gp70. Cysteine and homoserine were also taken up, but sodium was necessary for their transport. These properties of ecoR correspond to those of the y+ amino-acid transporter. Our results demonstrate the subversion of a ubiquitous cell membrane protein, in this case a basic amino acid transporter, for use as a retroviral receptor.
RNA is involved in many biological functions, ranging from information storage and transfer to the catalysis of reactions involving both nucleic acids and proteins. Previous crystallographic studies on RNA oligomeric chains provide only averaged structures or information limited in resolution. The oligomer [U(U-A)6A]2 was chosen for the study of protein-RNA interactions in viruses. Its size and base composition mimic portions of the genomic RNA in alfalfa mosaic virus that bind to the amino terminus of the viral subunit. The actual sequence was designed to guarantee the formation of a single species of duplex and to facilitate the production of the pure oligomer in large quantities. The molecular structure, derived from the 2.25 A resolution X-ray diffraction data, allows the most detailed analysis of an A-RNA helix reported to date. Two kinks are observed that divide the duplex into three blocks, each close to a canonical A-helical conformation. A few intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving 2'-hydroxyl groups stabilize this peculiar conformation of the RNA, which may be related to the temperature used for the crystallization (35 degrees C). The structure demonstrates both the plasticity of the RNA molecule and the role of the 2'-hydroxyl groups in intermolecular interactions.
The complete nucleotide sequence of the doubt-stranded circular DNA of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) was determined. Analysis of this sequence in conjunction with known transcriptional data for the virus provides a basis of determining the organization of the papillomavirus genome. All the major open reading frames are located on the same DNA strand. The region transcribed in BPV-transformed cells contains open frames in all three translational frames whereas the region transcribed in productively infected bovine fibropapillomas is characterized by two large open reading frames partitioned by a single translational stop codon. The localization of sequences diagnostic of promoters and polyadenylation sites suggests that splicing is involved in the biosynthesis of the viral mRNAs. A sequence comparison indicates the genome organization of the bovine papillomavirus and that of the members of the simian virus 40-polyomavirus subgroup to be distinct, suggesting that these two groups of viruses are evolutionarily unrelated.
In the adult cerebral cortex, many retrovirally labelled clones are widely dispersed, though the mechanisms of this dispersion are not well understood. Here we investigate the temporal sequence of clonal dispersion after labelling progenitors of rat cortical cells with replication-incompetent retroviruses at early stages of cortical neurogenesis, 14-15 days after conception (E14/15). The location of labelled daughter cells was determined 3, 6 or 10 days later. Labelled sibling cells were radially arrayed three days after infection (E18). In contrast, by six days after infection (E20/21), 43% of cortical clones were dispersed non-radially by at least 500 microns. Four of these widespread clones were dispersed longitudinally by > or = 2 mm, implying sustained rates of dispersion of > 15 microns per hour. Dispersed sibling cells occurred within proliferative zones of the forebrain in 35% of widely dispersed clones, suggesting that some dispersion reflects movement of dividing cells. Some clones dispersed beyond the neocortex into the olfactory bulb. Progenitor cell dispersion represents a previously unrecognized mode of migration by which sibling cells become widely dispersed in the developing forebrain.
Whether zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, AZT) should be offered to symptomless individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), in the hope of delaying or even preventing progression to AIDS, has been much debated. The discussion has focused on the efficacy of the drug in delaying progression to disease, the severity of its side-effects, and the likelihood of its prolonged and widespread use resulting in zidovudine-resistant strains of the virus. Little attention has been given to the degree to which treatment reduces the infectiousness of symptomless patients, and to the concomitant implications for the overall transmission rate of HIV-1 in the community. Here we use simple mathematical models to show that community treatment with antiviral drugs or immunotherapies that lengthen the incubation period of AIDS without significantly reducing the infectiousness of treated individuals, can increase the rate at which HIV-1 infection spreads (which is fairly obvious) and can even, under certain circumstances, increase the AIDS-related death rate in the community (which is less obvious).
Human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV) are closely associated with some human T-cell leukemias and lymphomas. A unique 3' region of the HTLV genome is believed to be involved in HTLV-induced cellular transformation, although the function of this region has yet to be determined. A subgenomic messenger RNA transcribed from this region of HTLV has now been characterized. These results provide direct evidence for the expression of a novel gene in HTLV.
Bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) contains two independent transforming genes that have been mapped to the E5 and E6 open reading frames (ORF's). The E5 transforming protein was identified by means of an antiserum against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 20 COOH-terminal amino acids of the E5 ORF. The E5 polypeptide is the smallest viral transforming protein yet characterized; it had an apparent size of 7 kilodaltons. The transforming polypeptide is encoded entirely within the second half of the E5 ORF and its predicted amino acid composition is very unusual; 68% of the amino acids are strongly hydrophobic and 34% are leucine. Cell fractionation studies localized this polypeptide predominantly to cellular membranes.
Targeted biological therapies hold tremendous potential for treatment of cancer, yet their use has been limited by constraints on delivery and effective tumor targeting. We combined an immune effector cell population [cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells] with an oncolytic viral therapy to achieve directed delivery to, and regression of, tumors in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse models. Preinfection of CIK cells with modified vaccinia virus resulted in a prolonged eclipse phase with the virus remaining hidden until interaction with the tumor. Whole-body imaging revealed that the cells retained their ability to traffic to and to infiltrate the tumor effectively before releasing the virus. These results illustrate the potential of combining biotherapeutics for synergistic effects that more effectively treat cancer.
Negative-strand RNA viruses condense their genome into a helical nucleoprotein-RNA complex, the nucleocapsid, which is packed into virions and serves as a template for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex. The crystal structure of a recombinant rabies virus nucleoprotein-RNA complex, organized in an undecameric ring, has been determined at 3.5 angstrom resolution. Polymerization of the nucleoprotein is achieved by domain exchange between protomers, with flexible hinges allowing nucleocapsid formation. The two core domains of the nucleoprotein clamp around the RNA at their interface and shield it from the environment. RNA sequestering by nucleoproteins is likely a common mechanism used by negative-strand RNA viruses to protect their genomes from the innate immune response directed against viral RNA in human host cells at certain stages of an infectious cycle.
Reproductive strategies such as sexual reproduction and recombination that involve the shuffling of parental genomes for the production of offspring are ubiquitous in nature. However, their evolutionary benefit remains unclear. Many theories have identified potential benefits, but progress is hampered by the scarcity of relevant data. One class of theories is based on the assumption that mutations affecting fitness exhibit negative epistasis. Retroviruses recombine frequently and thus provide a unique opportunity to test these theories. Using amino acid sequence data and fitness values from 9466 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) isolates, we find in contrast to these theories strong statistical evidence for a predominance of positive epistasis in HIV-1.
Little is known about virus-host cell interactions that regulate the lytic potential of viruses during productive replication. Sindbis virus (SV), a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus in the alphavirus genus (family Togaviridae), results in lytic infection in most vertebrate cell lines, but persistent productive infection in post-mitotic neurons. The cellular oncogene bcl-2, which encodes an inner mitochondrial membrane protein of M(r) 26,000 (ref. 2), blocks programmed cell death (apoptosis) in neurons. We therefore investigated whether SV infection induces programmed cell death in non-neuronal cells, and if so, whether virus-induced programmed cell death can be blocked by transfection with bcl-2. We demonstrate that SV infection of baby hamster kidney (BHK-2), mouse neuroblastoma (N18), and rat prostatic adenocarcinoma (AT-3) cells results in programmed cell death, whereas SV infection of bcl-2-transfected AT-3 cells results in long-term persistent productive infection. Thus cellular bcl-2 oncogene expression plays a role in the establishment of persistent viral infection by blocking virus-induced programmed cell death.
The recurrence of influenza virus infection in man is attributed primarily to changes occurring in the antigenic structure of the viral surface glycoproteins, especially of the haemagglutinin (HA) molecule. Comparative antigenic analysis of epidemic influenza virus strains has allowed the description of 'strain-specific' and 'cross-reactive' antigenic determinants. However, the interpretation of these findings remained ambiguous, because the specificity of the applied antisera was insufficiently defined and because the antigenic differences among the HA molecules of various epidemic virus strains resulted presumably from a large number of amino acid substitutions. Thus, in characterizing the antigenic structure of the HA molecule, our approach has been (1) to generate a panel of monoclonal anti-HA hybridoma antibodies, (2) to use some of these antibodies to select mutants of the influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8) virus expressing antigenically altered HA molecules, and (3) to construct an operational antigenic map of the HA molecule by comparative antigenic analysis of the mutant viruses with the monoclonal antibodies. As we report here, analysis of the 34 mutant viruses selected has enabled us to define four antigenic sites on the HA molecule. Our observation that these sites have undergone antigenic drift to a different extent in nature implies that the mechanisms responsible for antigenic drift act selectively on distinct structures of the HA molecule.
Regions in chromatin which are hypersensitive to the action of DNase I appear to be associated with sites of genetic activity; the association between DNase I hypersensitivity and transcriptional activation is well known. In the case of the chicken beta-globin gene the establishment of a DNase I hypersensitive site is dependent on tissue-specific trans-acting factors. Such factors have also been implicated in the action of viral and cellular enhancers, which are themselves hypersensitive to DNase I. Enhancers have been defined operationally as DNA sequences which act in cis to potentiate transcription from their own, heterologous or cryptic promoters. This activity is essentially unaffected by changes in the orientation, position (5' or 3') or distance of the enhancer element with respect to its cognate promoter. We demonstrate here that the transcriptional rescue of the Xenopus laevis beta-globin gene by simian virus 40 (SV40) sequences including the enhancer coincides with the conferment of DNase I hypersensitivity upon that gene, and that this occurs in the absence of any change in the complement of trans-acting factors. These results suggest that a propensity to form sites hypersensitive to the action of DNase I is encoded in the primary sequence of DNA, and that this predilection is aggravated by SV40 sequences, perhaps through a mechanism dependent on supercoiling.
