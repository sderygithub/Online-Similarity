The papillomavirus E2 protein regulates viral transcription and DNA replication through interactions with cellular and viral proteins. The amino-terminal activation domain, which represents a protein class whose structural themes are poorly understood, contains key residues that mediate these functional contacts. The crystal structure of a protease-resistant core of the human papillomavirus type 18 E2 activation domain reveals a novel fold creating a cashew-shaped form with a glutamine-rich alpha helix packed against a beta-sheet framework. The protein surface shows extensive overlap of determinants for replication and transcription. The structure broadens the concept of activators to include proteins with potentially malleable, but certainly ordered, structures.
The gene encoding the regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) was cloned by virtue of its ability to complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the hamster cell line tsBN2, which undergoes premature chromosome condensation or arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle at non-permissive temperatures. RCC1 homologues have been identified in many eukaryotes, including budding and fission yeast. Mutations in the gene affect pre-messenger RNA processing and transport, mating, initiation of mitosis and chromatin decondensation, suggesting that RCC1 is important in the control of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and the cell cycle. Biochemically, RCC1 is a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor for the nuclear Ras homologue Ran; it increases the dissociation of Ran-bound GDP by 10(5)-fold. It may also bind to DNAvia a protein-protein complex. Here we show that the structure of human RCC1, solved to 1.7-A resolution by X-ray crystallography, consists of a seven-bladed propeller formed from internal repeats of 51-68 residues per blade. The sequence and structure of the repeats differ from those of WD40-domain proteins, which also form seven-bladed propellers and include the beta-subunits of G proteins. The nature of the structure explains the consequences of a wide range of known mutations. The region of the protein that is involved in guanine-nucleotide exchange is located opposite the region that is thought to be involved in chromosome binding.
The heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins act at the inner surface of the plasma membrane to relay information from cell surface receptors to effectors inside the cell. These G proteins are not integral membrane proteins, yet are membrane associated. The processing and function of the gamma subunit of the yeast G protein involved in mating-pheromone signal transduction was found to be affected by the same mutations that block ras processing. The nature of these mutations implied that the gamma subunit was polyisoprenylated and that this modification was necessary for membrane association and biological activity. A microbial screen was developed for pharmacological agents that inhibit polyisoprenylation and that have potential application in cancer therapy.
Dynamin, a crucial factor in endocytosis, is a member of a family of GTPases that participates in membrane fission. It was initially proposed to act as a machine that constricts and cuts the neck of nascent vesicles in a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent reaction, but subsequent studies suggested alternative models. Here we monitored the effect of nucleotides on dynamin-coated lipid tubules in real time. Addition of GTP, but not of GDP or GTP-gammaS, resulted in twisting of the tubules and supercoiling, suggesting a rotatory movement of the helix turns relative to each other during GTP hydrolysis. Rotation was confirmed by the movement of beads attached to the tubules. Twisting activity produced a longitudinal tension that was released by tubule breakage when both ends of the tubule were anchored. Fission also occurred when dynamin and GTP were added to lipid tubules that had been generated from liposomes by the motor activity of kinesin on microtubules. No fission events were observed in the absence of longitudinal tension. These findings demonstrate a mechanoenzyme activity of dynamin in endocytosis, but also imply that constriction is not sufficient for fission. At the short necks of endocytic vesicles, other factors leading to tension may cooperate with the constricting activity of dynamin to induce fission.
Dorsoventral patterning of vertebrate and Drosophila embryos requires bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and antagonists of BMP activity. The Drosophila gene tolloid encodes a metalloprotease similar to BMP-1 that interacts genetically with decapentaplegic, the Drosophila homolog of vertebrate BMP-2/4. Zebrafish embryos overexpressing a zebrafish homolog of tolloid were shown to resemble loss-of-function mutations in chordino, the zebrafish homolog of the Xenopus BMP-4 antagonist Chordin. Furthermore, Chordin was degraded by COS cells expressing Tolloid. These data suggest that Tolloid antagonizes Chordin activity by proteolytically cleaving Chordin. A conserved function for zebrafish and Drosophila Tolloid during embryogenesis is proposed.
The protein Sex-lethal (SXL) controls dosage compensation in Drosophila by inhibiting the splicing and translation of male-specific-lethal-2 (msl-2) transcripts. Here we report that splicing inhibition of msl-2 requires a binding site for SXL at the polypyrimidine (poly(Y)) tract associated with the 3' splice site, and an unusually long distance between the poly(Y) tract and the conserved AG dinucleotide at the 3' end of the intron. Only this combination allows efficient blockage of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle binding and displacement of the large subunit of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF65) from the poly(Y) tract by SXL. Crosslinking experiments with ultraviolet light indicate that the small subunit of U2AF (U2AF35) contacts the AG dinucleotide only when located in proximity to the poly(Y) tract. This interaction stabilizes U2AF65 binding such that SXL can no longer displace it from the poly(Y) tract. Our results reveal a novel function for U2AF35, a critical role for the 3' splice site AG at the earliest steps of spliceosome assembly and the need for a weakened U2AF35-AG interaction to regulate intron removal.
An analysis of the aminoacylation kinetics of unmodified yeast tRNAPhe mutants revealed that five single-stranded nucleotides are important for its recognition by yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, provided they were positioned correctly in a properly folded tRNA structure. When four other tRNAs were changed to have these five nucleotides, they became near-normal substrates for the enzyme.
Selective pressures on proteins are usually measured by comparing nucleotide sequences. Here we introduce a method to detect selection on the basis of a single genome sequence. We catalogue the relative strength of selection on each gene in the entire genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. Our analysis confirms that most antigens are under strong selection for amino-acid substitutions, particularly the PE/PPE family of putative surface proteins in M. tuberculosis and the EMP1 family of cytoadhering surface proteins in P. falciparum. We also identify many uncharacterized proteins that are under strong selection in each pathogen. We provide a genome-wide analysis of natural selection acting on different stages of an organism's life cycle: genes expressed in the ring stage of P. falciparum are under stronger positive selection than those expressed in other stages of the parasite's life cycle. Our method of estimating selective pressures requires far fewer data than comparative sequence analysis, and it measures selection across an entire genome; the method can readily be applied to a large range of sequenced organisms.
The p53 tumour suppressor is a short-lived protein that is maintained at low levels in normal cells by Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis. Stabilization of p53 is crucial for its tumour suppressor function. However, the precise mechanism by which ubiquitinated p53 levels are regulated in vivo is not completely understood. By mass spectrometry of affinity-purified p53-associated factors, we have identified herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) as a novel p53-interacting protein. HAUSP strongly stabilizes p53 even in the presence of excess Mdm2, and also induces p53-dependent cell growth repression and apoptosis. Significantly, HAUSP has an intrinsic enzymatic activity that specifically deubiquitinates p53 both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive point mutant of HAUSP in cells increases the levels of p53 ubiquitination and destabilizes p53. These findings reveal an important mechanism by which p53 can be stabilized by direct deubiquitination and also imply that HAUSP might function as a tumour suppressor in vivo through the stabilization of p53.
Specification of dorsal-ventral cell fate during Drosophila embryogenesis is mediated by a signal transduction pathway. Asymmetry of cell fates arises through the spatially restricted production of a ligand in an extracellular compartment called the perivitelline space. The snake and easter genes are required for the production of the ligand and they encode the proenzyme form of secreted extracellular serine proteases. We have examined the effect of producing a preactivated form of the snake protease on the generation of dorsal-ventral polarity. SP6 RNA microinjection experiments reveal that different cell fates acquired at cellular blastoderm can be specified by the amount and spatial distribution of activated snake protein. Our results support a protease cascade model in which localized activation of uniformly distributed protease proenzymes leads to the spatially restricted production of ligand in the perivitelline space on the ventral side of the embryo.
The structure of a 20-amino acid peptide inhibitor bound to the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and its interactions with the enzyme, are described. The x-ray crystal structure of the complex is the basis of the analysis. The peptide inhibitor, derived from a naturally occurring heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor, contains an amphipathic helix that is followed by a turn and an extended conformation. The extended region occupies the cleft between the two lobes of the enzyme and contains a five-residue consensus recognition sequence common to all substrates and peptide inhibitors of the catalytic subunit. The helical portion of the peptide binds to a hydrophobic groove and conveys high affinity binding. Loops from both domains converge at the active site and contribute to a network of conserved residues at the sites of magnesium adenosine triphosphate binding and catalysis. Amino acids associated with peptide recognition, nonconserved, extend over a large surface area.
Cloning by the transplantation of somatic nuclei into unfertilized eggs requires a dramatic remodeling of chromosomal architecture. Many proteins are specifically lost from nuclei, and others are taken up from the egg cytoplasm. Recreating this exchange in vitro, we identified the chromatin-remodeling nucleosomal adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) ISWI as a key molecule in this process. ISWI actively erases the TATA binding protein from association with the nuclear matrix. Defining the biochemistry of global nuclear remodeling may facilitate the efficiency of cloning and other dedifferentiation events that establish new stem cell lineages.
The immunosuppressant rapamycin inhibited proliferation of the H4IIEC hepatoma cell line. Rapamycin, but not its structural analog FK506, also inhibited the basal and insulin-stimulated activity of the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase. By contrast, insulin stimulation of the p85 Rsk S6 kinase and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity were unaffected by drug. Rapamycin treatment of COS cells transfected with recombinant p70 S6 kinase completely inhibited the appearance of the hyperphosphorylated form of p70 S6 kinase concomitant with the inhibition of enzyme activity toward 40S subunits. Thus, rapamycin inhibits a signal transduction element that is necessary for the activation of p70 S6 kinase and mitogenesis but unnecessary for activation of p85 Rsk S6 kinase or MAP kinase.
RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved sequence-specific gene regulatory mechanism mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is composed of a single-stranded guide RNA and an Argonaute protein. The PIWI domain, a highly conserved motif within Argonaute, has been shown to adopt an RNase H fold critical for the endonuclease cleavage activity of RISC. Here we report the crystal structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus Piwi protein bound to double-stranded RNA, thereby identifying the binding pocket for guide-strand 5'-end recognition and providing insight into guide-strand-mediated messenger RNA target recognition. The phosphorylated 5' end of the guide RNA is anchored within a highly conserved basic pocket, supplemented by the carboxy-terminal carboxylate and a bound divalent cation. The first nucleotide from the 5' end of the guide RNA is unpaired and stacks over a conserved tyrosine residue, whereas successive nucleotides form a four-base-pair RNA duplex. Mutation of the corresponding amino acids that contact the 5' phosphate in human Ago2 resulted in attenuated mRNA cleavage activity. Our structure of the Piwi-RNA complex, and that determined elsewhere, provide direct support for the 5' region of the guide RNA serving as a nucleation site for pairing with target mRNA and for a fixed distance separating the RISC-mediated mRNA cleavage site from the anchored 5' end of the guide RNA.
The combined x-ray diffraction and electron microscopic examination of myelin has provided reasonable, but not conclusive, support for its structure as a basically bimolecular leaflet of phospholipid that is partially interspersed with protein. But there is very little basis for extending this concept to biological membranes in general. There is no adequate experimental support for the specific orientation of phospholipids as proposed in the unit membrane theory or for the proposed polar nature of protein-lipid bonds, even in myelin. Membranes differ widely in chemical composition, metabolism, function, enzymatic composition, and even in their electron microscopic image. The only similarity is their general resemblance in electron micrographs, but, until more is known about the chemistry of electron microscopy, this evidence cannot be interpreted with confidence. One positive conclusion to which I have come is that much more chemical evidence must, and can, be obtained. Techniques for the isolation of membranes are improving and protein and lipid chemistry are now highly refined arts. Quantitative analysis of many different membranes is possible and the data can be related in some instances, notably bacterial plasma membranes, to calculations of surface area. Chemical and physical changes induced in membranes of widely different lipid composition by the preparatory procedures of electron microscopy can be determined directly and correlated with the electron microscopic image. Model systems can be assembled whose compositions closely resemble those of biological membranes. Membranes can be disassociated into subunits whose properties can be studied. In particular, x-ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy by negative staining of reaggregates of lipoproteins isolated from membranes would be very informative. Perhaps most important, the problem of membrane structure must be considered in relation to the problems of membrane function and membrane biosynthesis.
Giardia lamblia (also called Giardia intestinalis) is one of the most common intestinal parasites of humans. To evade the host's immune response, Giardia undergoes antigenic variation-a process that allows the parasite to develop chronic and recurrent infections. From a repertoire of approximately 190 variant-specific surface protein (VSP)-coding genes, Giardia expresses only one VSP on the surface of each parasite at a particular time, but spontaneously switches to a different VSP by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that regulation of VSP expression involves a system comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Dicer and Argonaute, known components of the RNA interference machinery. Clones expressing a single surface antigen efficiently transcribe several VSP genes but only accumulate transcripts encoding the VSP to be expressed. Detection of antisense RNAs corresponding to the silenced VSP genes and small RNAs from the silenced but not for the expressed vsp implicate the RNA interference pathway in antigenic variation. Remarkably, silencing of Dicer and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leads to a change from single to multiple VSP expression in individual parasites.
The widely expressed protein Fas is a member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor family which can trigger apoptosis. However, Fas surface expression does not necessarily render cells susceptible to Fas ligand-induced death signals, indicating that inhibitors of the apoptosis-signalling pathway must exist. Here we report the characterization of an inhibitor of apoptosis, designated FLIP (for FLICE-inhibitory protein), which is predominantly expressed in muscle and lymphoid tissues. The short form, FLIPs, contains two death effector domains and is structurally related to the viral FLIP inhibitors of apoptosis, whereas the long form, FLIP(L), contains in addition a caspase-like domain in which the active-centre cysteine residue is substituted by a tyrosine residue. FLIPs and FLIP(L) interact with the adaptor protein FADD and the protease FLICE, and potently inhibit apoptosis induced by all known human death receptors. FLIP(L) is expressed during the early stage of T-cell activation, but disappears when T cells become susceptible to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis. High levels of FLIP(L) protein are also detectable in melanoma cell lines and malignant melanoma tumours. Thus FLIP may be implicated in tissue homeostasis as an important regulator of apoptosis.
The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its amino-terminal residue. Distinct versions of the N-end rule operate in all eukaryotes examined. It is shown that the bacterium Escherichia coli also has the N-end rule pathway. Amino-terminal arginine, lysine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan confer 2-minute half-lives on a test protein; the other amino-terminal residues confer greater than 10-hour half-lives on the same protein. Amino-terminal arginine and lysine are secondary destabilizing residues in E. coli because their activity depends on their conjugation to the primary destabilizing residues leucine or phenylalanine by leucine, phenylalanine-transfer RNA-protein transferase. The adenosine triphosphate-dependent protease Clp (Ti) is required for the degradation of N-end rule substrates in E. coli.
The integral membrane protein fumarate reductase catalyzes the final step of anaerobic respiration when fumarate is the terminal electron acceptor. The homologous enzyme succinate dehydrogenase also plays a prominent role in cellular energetics as a member of the Krebs cycle and as complex II of the aerobic respiratory chain. Fumarate reductase consists of four subunits that contain a covalently linked flavin adenine dinucleotide, three different iron-sulfur clusters, and at least two quinones. The crystal structure of intact fumarate reductase has been solved at 3.3 angstrom resolution and demonstrates that the cofactors are arranged in a nearly linear manner from the membrane-bound quinone to the active site flavin. Although fumarate reductase is not associated with any proton-pumping function, the two quinones are positioned on opposite sides of the membrane in an arrangement similar to that of the Q-cycle organization observed for cytochrome bc1.
Prenylated proteins contain a covalently linked cholesterol intermediate near their carboxyl-termini. Maturation of most prenylated proteins involves proteolytic removal of the last three amino acids. Two genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RCE1 and AFC1, were identified that appear to be responsible for this processing. The Afc1 protein is a zinc protease that participates in the processing of yeast a-factor mating pheromone. The Rce1 protein contributes to the processing of both Ras protein and a-factor. Deletion of both AFC1 and RCE1 resulted in the loss of proteolytic processing of prenylated proteins. Disruption of RCE1 led to defects in Ras localization and signaling and suppressed the activated phenotype associated with the allele RAS2val19.
In bacteriophage T4 DNA, transcription units recognized in vitro by host RNA polymerase consist of promotor-proximal 'immediate early' (IE) genes and promotor-distal 'delayed early' (DE) genes separated from each other by rho-dependent transcription terminators. In vivo, the transition from IE to DE transcription requires phage-specific protein synthesis and can be prevented by chloramphenicol (CAM). Most of the information about IE/DE transition has been obtained by hybridizaton analyses of mixtures of RNA species synthesized simultaneously on several T4 transcription units (for review see ref. 3). A useful model for the study of T4 gene expression at the level of primary transcripts and individual gene products is provided by the T4 tRNA operon, a cluster of genes coding for eight T4-specific transfer RNAs and two stable RNAs (species 1 and 2) of unknown function (Fig. 1). The 10 genes of the tRNA operon are arranged in two subclusters (I and II) with a promotor located about 1 kilobase pair upstream. The primary transcripts and the final gene products of this region have been identified and isolated. Moreover, this genetic region was recently cloned and a part of it sequenced. We describe here the expression of T4 tRNA genes in vivo and in vitro in terms of the IE/DE concept and demonstrate that the two subclusters of the tRNA operon are subject to different modes of control.
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a modified base present at low levels in diverse cell types in mammals. 5hmC is generated by the TET family of Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes through oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC). 5hmC and TET proteins have been implicated in stem cell biology and cancer, but information on the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC is limited. Here we describe two novel and specific approaches to profile the genomic localization of 5hmC. The first approach, termed GLIB (glucosylation, periodate oxidation, biotinylation) uses a combination of enzymatic and chemical steps to isolate DNA fragments containing as few as a single 5hmC. The second approach involves conversion of 5hmC to cytosine 5-methylenesulphonate (CMS) by treatment of genomic DNA with sodium bisulphite, followed by immunoprecipitation of CMS-containing DNA with a specific antiserum to CMS. High-throughput sequencing of 5hmC-containing DNA from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells showed strong enrichment within exons and near transcriptional start sites. 5hmC was especially enriched at the start sites of genes whose promoters bear dual histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks. Our results indicate that 5hmC has a probable role in transcriptional regulation, and suggest a model in which 5hmC contributes to the 'poised' chromatin signature found at developmentally-regulated genes in ES cells.
Repetitive stimulation (100 pulses per second for 1 second) of the Schafer collateral-commissural system of the rat hippocampus induces long-term potentiation of synaptic strength and produces significant changes in the subsequent endogenous phosphorylation of a 40,000-dalton protein from synaptic plasma membranes. This effect is not observed after stimulation in calcium-deficient media or after simulation at the rate of one pulse per second for 100 seconds. These findings provide evidence that repetitive synaptic activation can alter the phosphorylation machinery of the synaptic region and suggest a biochemical process which may be involved in the production of neuronal plasticity.
Norethisterone (17 alpha-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) is an effective irreversible inhibitor of estrogen synthetase (aromatase), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens, even at a 2 X 10(-6) molar concentration. This irreversible inactivation, which is directed toward the active site of aromatase and requires the cofactor-reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, is both time- and concentration-dependent. Ethisterone (17 alpha-ethynyltestosterone), in contrast, is not a suicide inhibitor of aromatase even at concentrations of 10(-4) molar.
Studies of the sequence-specific binding of proteins to DNA have so far relied on in vitro experiments using cloned restriction fragments containing the relevant DNA sequences. We have applied the genomic sequencing technique of Church and Gilbert to show that the interactions observed in vitro occur in vivo. We use this approach to study the binding of regulatory proteins to the lac operon in vivo and detect changes in the reactivity (inhibition or enhancement) of guanines to methylation by dimethyl sulphate caused by the proximity of proteins to the N-7 atom of these guanines. We can detect the simultaneous binding of the catobolite gene activator protein (CAP) and the Lac repressor to their specific recognition sequences, and following induction of the lac operon we observe effects that are related to RNA polymerase binding or RNA elongation. We have successfully used oligonucleotide probes as short as 17 bases to display genomic sequence.
The brain hypothalamus contains certain secreted molecules that are important in regulating feeding behaviour. Here we show that nesfatin, corresponding to NEFA/nucleobindin2 (NUCB2), a secreted protein of unknown function, is expressed in the appetite-control hypothalamic nuclei in rats. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of NUCB2 reduces feeding. Rat cerebrospinal fluid contains nesfatin-1, an amino-terminal fragment derived from NUCB2, and its expression is decreased in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus under starved conditions. I.c.v. injection of nesfatin-1 decreases food intake in a dose-dependent manner, whereas injection of an antibody neutralizing nesfatin-1 stimulates appetite. In contrast, i.c.v. injection of other possible fragments processed from NUCB2 does not promote satiety, and conversion of NUCB2 to nesfatin-1 is necessary to induce feeding suppression. Chronic i.c.v. injection of nesfatin-1 reduces body weight, whereas rats gain body weight after chronic i.c.v. injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotide against the gene encoding NUCB2. Nesfatin-1-induced anorexia occurs in Zucker rats with a leptin receptor mutation, and an anti-nesfatin-1 antibody does not block leptin-induced anorexia. In contrast, central injection of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone elevates NUCB2 gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus, and satiety by nesfatin-1 is abolished by an antagonist of the melanocortin-3/4 receptor. We identify nesfatin-1 as a satiety molecule that is associated with melanocortin signalling in the hypothalamus.
Almost all of the key molecules involved in the innate and adaptive immune response are glycoproteins. In the cellular immune system, specific glycoforms are involved in the folding, quality control, and assembly of peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and the T cell receptor complex. Although some glycopeptide antigens are presented by the MHC, the generation of peptide antigens from glycoproteins may require enzymatic removal of sugars before the protein can be cleaved. Oligosaccharides attached to glycoproteins in the junction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells help to orient binding faces, provide protease protection, and restrict nonspecific lateral protein-protein interactions. In the humoral immune system, all of the immunoglobulins and most of the complement components are glycosylated. Although a major function for sugars is to contribute to the stability of the proteins to which they are attached, specific glycoforms are involved in recognition events. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease, agalactosylated glycoforms of aggregated immunoglobulin G may induce association with the mannose-binding lectin and contribute to the pathology.
Metabolic plasticity, which largely relies on the creation of new genes, is an essential feature of plant adaptation and speciation and has led to the evolution of large gene families. A typical example is provided by the diversification of the cytochrome P450 enzymes in plants. We describe here a retroposition, neofunctionalization, and duplication sequence that, via selective and local amino acid replacement, led to the evolution of a novel phenolic pathway in Brassicaceae. This pathway involves a cascade of six successive hydroxylations by two partially redundant cytochromes P450, leading to the formation of N1,N5-di(hydroxyferuloyl)-N10-sinapoylspermidine, a major pollen constituent and so-far-overlooked player in phenylpropanoid metabolism. This example shows how positive Darwinian selection can favor structured clusters of nonsynonymous substitutions that are needed for the transition of enzymes to new functions.
Celiac Sprue, a widely prevalent autoimmune disease of the small intestine, is induced in genetically susceptible individuals by exposure to dietary gluten. A 33-mer peptide was identified that has several characteristics suggesting it is the primary initiator of the inflammatory response to gluten in Celiac Sprue patients. In vitro and in vivo studies in rats and humans demonstrated that it is stable toward breakdown by all gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal brush-border membrane proteases. The peptide reacted with tissue transglutaminase, the major autoantigen in Celiac Sprue, with substantially greater selectivity than known natural substrates of this extracellular enzyme. It was a potent inducer of gut-derived human T cell lines from 14 of 14 Celiac Sprue patients. Homologs of this peptide were found in all food grains that are toxic to Celiac Sprue patients but are absent from all nontoxic food grains. The peptide could be detoxified in in vitro and in vivo assays by exposure to a bacterial prolyl endopeptidase, suggesting a strategy for oral peptidase supplement therapy for Celiac Sprue.
Most protein mutations, and mutations that alter protein functions in particular, undermine stability and are therefore deleterious. Chaperones, or heat-shock proteins, are often implicated in buffering mutations, and could thus facilitate the acquisition of neutral genetic diversity and the rate of adaptation. We examined the ability of the Escherichia coli GroEL/GroES chaperonins to buffer destabilizing and adaptive mutations. Here we show that mutational drifts performed in vitro with four different enzymes indicated that GroEL/GroES overexpression doubled the number of accumulating mutations, and promoted the folding of enzyme variants carrying mutations in the protein core and/or mutations with higher destabilizing effects (destabilization energies of >3.5 kcal mol(-)(1), on average, versus approximately 1 kcal mol(-)(1) in the absence of GroEL/GroES). The divergence of modified enzymatic specificity occurred much faster under GroEL/GroES overexpression, in terms of the number of adapted variants (>or=2-fold) and their improved specificity and activity (>or=10-fold). These results indicate that protein stability is a major constraint in protein evolution, and buffering mechanisms such as chaperonins are key in alleviating this constraint.
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has a key role in cellular responses to hypoxia, including the regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis and apoptosis. The alpha subunits of HIF are rapidly degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions, but are stabilized by hypoxia. Cobaltous ions or iron chelators mimic hypoxia, indicating that the stimuli may interact through effects on a ferroprotein oxygen sensor. Here we demonstrate a critical role for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene product pVHL in HIF-1 regulation. In VHL-defective cells, HIF alpha-subunits are constitutively stabilized and HIF-1 is activated. Re-expression of pVHL restored oxygen-dependent instability. pVHL and HIF alpha-subunits co-immunoprecipitate, and pVHL is present in the hypoxic HIF-1 DNA-binding complex. In cells exposed to iron chelation or cobaltous ions, HIF-1 is dissociated from pVHL. These findings indicate that the interaction between HIF-1 and pVHL is iron dependent, and that it is necessary for the oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF alpha-subunits. Thus, constitutive HIF-1 activation may underlie the angiogenic phenotype of VHL-associated tumours. The pVHL/HIF-1 interaction provides a new focus for understanding cellular oxygen sensing.
The major histocompatibility complex is a chromosomal segment embodying several gene clusters among which those with immune functions are the best characterized. This region is suspected to host other as yet undetected genes whose characterization may shed light on the population genetics and evolution of the whole gene complex and thus on its unexplained character of marker locus for a number of diseases of nonimmune or unknown pathogenesis. A novel gene was identified that is transcribed in all tissues tested and is located in mouse and man between the CA and Bf genes of the H-2 and HLA complexes, respectively. From the nucleotide sequence, derived from liver complementary DNA clones, it is predicted that this novel single-copy gene encodes a 42-kilodalton polypeptide that bears no recognizable relation to the protein families known so far, but it displays striking hallmarks of natural selection.
Binding of catecholamines to the beta-adrenergic receptor results in the activation of adenylate cyclase and the intracellular formation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). In the past 20 years the events that lead from hormone binding at the cell surface receptor site to the synthesis of cAMP at the inner layer of the membrane have been intensively studied. Signal transduction in this system involves the sequential interaction of the beta-adrenergic receptor with the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gs) and the adenylate cyclase catalyst (C). The mechanism of signal transduction from the receptor through Gs to C, as well as the role of the adenylate cyclase inhibitory G protein Gi, is discussed.
Insulin-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases [ERKs, also known as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases] is mediated by Ras. Insulin activates Ras primarily by increasing the rate of guanine nucleotide-releasing activity. Here, we show that insulin-induced activation of ERKs was enhanced by stable overexpression of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) but not by overexpression of GRB2 proteins with point mutations in the Src homology 2 and 3 domains. Moreover, a dominant negative form of Ras (with Ser17 substituted with Asn) blocked insulin-induced activation of ERKs in cells that overexpressed GRB2. GRB2 overexpression led to increased formation of a complex between the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor Sos (the product of the mammalian homolog of son of sevenless gene) and GRB2. In response to insulin stimulation, this complex bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1) and Shc. In contrast to the activated epidermal growth factor receptor that binds the GRB2-Sos complex directly, activation of the insulin receptor results in the interaction of GRB2-Sos with IRS-1 and Shc, thus linking the insulin receptor to Ras signaling pathways.
Unconventional myosin V (myoV) is an actin-based molecular motor that has a key function in organelle and mRNA transport, as well as in membrane trafficking. MyoV was the first member of the myosin superfamily shown to be processive, meaning that a single motor protein can 'walk' hand-over-hand along an actin filament for many steps before detaching. Full-length myoV has a low actin-activated MgATPase activity at low [Ca2+], whereas expressed constructs lacking the cargo-binding domain have a high activity regardless of [Ca2+] (refs 5-7). Hydrodynamic data and electron micrographs indicate that the active state is extended, whereas the inactive state is compact. Here we show the first three-dimensional structure of the myoV inactive state. Each myoV molecule consists of two heads that contain an amino-terminal motor domain followed by a lever arm that binds six calmodulins. The heads are followed by a coiled-coil dimerization domain (S2) and a carboxy-terminal globular cargo-binding domain. In the inactive structure, bending of myoV at the head-S2 junction places the cargo-binding domain near the motor domain's ATP-binding pocket, indicating that ATPase inhibition might occur through decreased rates of nucleotide exchange. The actin-binding interfaces are unobstructed, and the lever arm is oriented in a position typical of strong actin-binding states. This structure indicates that motor recycling after cargo delivery might occur through transport on actively treadmilling actin filaments rather than by diffusion.
The nucleotide sequence of the lacY gene coding for lactose permease (M protein) in Escherichia coli has been determined. The sequence includes the intergenic regions between the lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and lacY genes as well as the region between the lacY and lacA (transacetylase) genes. Lactose permease is predicted to consist of 417 residues (71% nonpolar), resulting in a protein with a molecular weight of 46,504. The reading frame was confirmed by the sequence of a nonsense mutation changing codon 33 from UGG to UAG.
Although the hormone-stimulated synthesis of 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids is known to form an intracellular signalling system, there is no consensus on the crucial receptor-regulated event in this pathway and it is still not clear which of the intermediates represent potential output signals. We show here that the key step in the synthesis of 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids in 3T3 cells stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor is the activation of a phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate (3)-hydroxy (PtdIns(4,5)P2 3-OH) kinase. A similar conclusion has been applied to explain the actions of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe on neutrophils, and it may be that receptors that couple through intrinsic tyrosine kinases or through G proteins stimulate the same step in 3-phosphorylated inositol lipid metabolism. The close parallel between these two mechanisms for the activation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 3-OH kinase and those described for the activation of another key signalling enzyme, phospholipase C (ref. 7), focuses attention on the product of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 3-OH kinase, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, as a possible new second messenger.
Coupling between ATP hydrolysis and microtubule movement was demonstrated several years ago in flagellar axonemes and subsequent studies suggest that the relevant microtubule motor, dynein, uses ATP to drive microtubule sliding by a cross-bridge mechanism analogous to that of myosin in muscles. Kinesin, a microtubule-based motility protein which may participate in organelle transport and mitosis, binds microtubules in a nucleotide-sensitive manner, and requires hydrolysable nucleotides to translocate microtubules over a glass surface. Recently, neuronal kinesin was shown to possess microtubule-activated ATPase activity although coupling between ATP hydrolysis and motility was not demonstrated. Here we report that sea urchin egg kinesin, prepared either with or without a 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate(AMPPNP)-induced microtubule binding step, also possesses significant microtubule-activated ATPase activity when Mg-ATP is used as a substrate. This ATPase activity is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by addition of Mg-free ATP, by chelation of Mg2+ with EDTA, by addition of Na3VO4, or by addition of AMPPNP with or without Mg2+. Addition of these same reagents also inhibits the microtubule-translocating activities of sea urchin egg kinesin in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the hypothesis that kinesin-driven motility is coupled to the microtubule-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity.
The three serotypes of poliovirus are members of the picornaviradae, a group of viruses which cause a variety of diseases of considerable importance in man and animals. We have previously used antigenic mutants resistant to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to identify a single antigenic site for the neutralization of poliovirus type 3 (ref. 1). Evidence based on oligonucleotide mapping suggested that this site corresponded largely to one physicochemical region of the capsid protein viral polypeptide 1 (VP1). We now present conclusive evidence that most of the mutations conferring resistance to neutralization are confined to an eight-amino acid region of VP1, specified by a sequence of viral RNA 277-300 bases from the start of the region coding for VP1. These data strongly suggest that this small region constitutes a major antigenic site involved in virus neutralization and they provide the most detailed information currently available on the antigenic site of a human virus.
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize fragments (peptides) of protein antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. In general, the peptides are derived from cytosolic proteins and are then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum where they assemble with the MHC class I heavy chains and beta 2-microglobulin to form stable and functional class I molecules. The proteases involved in the generation of these peptides are unknown. One candidate is the proteasome, a nonlysosomal proteinase complex abundantly present in the cytosol. Proteasomes have several proteolytically active sites and are complexes of high relative molecular mass (Mr about 600K), consisting of about 20-30 subunits with Mrs between 15 and 30K. Here we show that at least one of these subunits is encoded by the mouse MHC in the region between the K locus and the MHC class II region, and inducible by interferon-gamma. This raises the intriguing possibility that the MHC encodes not only the MHC class I molecules themselves but also proteases involved in the formation of MHC-binding peptides.
Deletion of more than 400 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of an enzyme causes a severe reduction in catalytic activity. Selected point mutations within the residual protein partially reverse the effects of the missing segment. The selection can yield mutants with activities at least ten times as high as those of the starting polypeptides. One well-characterized mutation, a single amino acid replacement in the residual polypeptide, increases the catalytic activity of the polypeptide by a factor of 5. The results suggest substantial potential for design of protein elements to compensate for missing polypeptide sequences. They also may reflect that progenitors of large aminoacyl-tRNA (transfer RNA) synthetases--one of which was used in these studies--were themselves much smaller.
In a diverse group of organisms that includes Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, planaria, hydra, trypanosomes, fungi and plants, the introduction of double-stranded RNAs inhibits gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. These responses, called RNA interference or post-transcriptional gene silencing, may provide anti-viral defence, modulate transposition or regulate gene expression. We have taken a biochemical approach towards elucidating the mechanisms underlying this genetic phenomenon. Here we show that 'loss-of-function' phenotypes can be created in cultured Drosophila cells by transfection with specific double-stranded RNAs. This coincides with a marked reduction in the level of cognate cellular messenger RNAs. Extracts of transfected cells contain a nuclease activity that specifically degrades exogenous transcripts homologous to transfected double-stranded RNA. This enzyme contains an essential RNA component. After partial purification, the sequence-specific nuclease co-fractionates with a discrete, approximately 25-nucleotide RNA species which may confer specificity to the enzyme through homology to the substrate mRNAs.
Telomeres, the specialized nucleoprotein structures that comprise the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, are essential for complete replication, and regulation of their length has been a focus of research on tumorigenesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the protein Rap1p binds to telomeric DNA and functions in the regulation of telomere length. A human telomere protein, hTRF (human TTAGGG repeat factor) binds the telomere sequence in vitro and localizes to telomeres cytologically, but its functions are not yet known. Here we use a genetic screen to identify a telomere protein in fission yeast, Taz1p (telomere-associated in Schizosaccharomyces pombe), that shares homology to the Myb proto-oncogene DNA-binding domain with hTRF. Disruption or deletion of the taz1+ gene causes a massive increase in telomere length. Taz1p is required for the repression of telomere-adjacent gene expression and for normal meiosis or sporulation. It may be a negative regulator of the telomere-replicating enzyme, telomerase, or may protect against activation of telomerase-independent pathways of telomere elongation.
Regulation of ribosome biogenesis is central to the control of cell growth. In rapidly growing yeast cells, ribosomal protein (RP) genes account for approximately one-half of all polymerase II transcription-initiation events, yet these genes are markedly and coordinately downregulated in response to a number of environmental stress conditions, or during the transition from fermentation to respiration. Although several conserved signalling pathways (TOR, RAS/protein kinase A and protein kinase C) impinge upon RP gene transcription, little is known about how initiation at these genes is controlled. Rap1 (refs 6, 7) and more recently Fhl1 (ref. 8) were shown to bind upstream of many RP genes. Here we show that the essential protein Ifh1 binds to and activates many RP gene promoters under optimal growth conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ifh1 is recruited to RP gene promoters through the forkhead-associated domain of Fhl1. Ifh1 binding decreases when RP genes are downregulated either by TOR inhibition or nutrient depletion, and is restored after release from starvation or upon regulated induction of IFH1 expression. These findings indicate a central role for Ifh1 and Fhl1 in RP gene regulation.
Galactose oxidase is an extracellular enzyme secreted by the fungus Dactylium dendroides. It is monomeric, with a relative molecular mass of 68,000, catalyses the stereospecific oxidation of a broad range of primary alcohol substrates and possesses a unique mononuclear copper site essential for catalysing a two-electron transfer reaction during the oxidation of primary alcohols to corresponding aldehydes. Recent evidence arguing against a Cu(III)-Cu(I) couple implies the existence of a second redox-active site proposed to involve pyrroloquinoline quinone or a tyrosine radical. We now report the crystal structure of galactose oxidase at 1.7 A resolution. This reveals a unique structural feature at the copper site with a novel thioether bond linking Cys 228 and Tyr 272 in a stacking interaction with Trp 290. We propose that these molecular components stabilize the protein free-radical species essential for catalysis and thus provide a 'built-in' secondary cofactor. This feature may represent a new mechanism for mediating electron transfer in metalloenzymes in the absence of exogenous cofactors.
Light microscopy immunohistochemical techniques were used to examine the distribution of glutamine synthetase in rat brain. Glutamine synthetase was found to be localized in the glial cells. Neuronal cell bodies, endothelial cells, and choroid epithelium contained no enzyme. The findings indicate that glia have a crucial role in glutamic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and ammonia metabolism in brain.
CpG islands (CGIs) are prominent in the mammalian genome owing to their GC-rich base composition and high density of CpG dinucleotides. Most human gene promoters are embedded within CGIs that lack DNA methylation and coincide with sites of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), irrespective of transcriptional activity. In spite of these intriguing correlations, the functional significance of non-methylated CGI sequences with respect to chromatin structure and transcription is unknown. By performing a search for proteins that are common to all CGIs, here we show high enrichment for Cfp1, which selectively binds to non-methylated CpGs in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of a mono-allelically methylated CGI confirmed that Cfp1 specifically associates with non-methylated CpG sites in vivo. High throughput sequencing of Cfp1-bound chromatin identified a notable concordance with non-methylated CGIs and sites of H3K4me3 in the mouse brain. Levels of H3K4me3 at CGIs were markedly reduced in Cfp1-depleted cells, consistent with the finding that Cfp1 associates with the H3K4 methyltransferase Setd1 (refs 7, 8). To test whether non-methylated CpG-dense sequences are sufficient to establish domains of H3K4me3, we analysed artificial CpG clusters that were integrated into the mouse genome. Despite the absence of promoters, the insertions recruited Cfp1 and created new peaks of H3K4me3. The data indicate that a primary function of non-methylated CGIs is to genetically influence the local chromatin modification state by interaction with Cfp1 and perhaps other CpG-binding proteins.
Many cell-surface receptors for hormones appear to exert their effects on target cells by interacting with specific guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) which couple receptors to their second-messenger signal generation systems. A common intracellular second messenger, which is used by many hormones, is cyclic AMP. This is produced by adenylate cyclase, whose activity is controlled by two G-proteins, Gs which mediates stimulatory effects and Gi inhibitory effects on adenylate cyclase activity. In liver, the hormone glucagon increases intracellular cAMP concentrations by activating adenylate cyclase by a Gs-mediated process. This effect of glucagon is antagonised by the hormone insulin, although the molecular mechanism by which insulin elicits its actions is obscure. However, insulin receptors exhibit a tyrosyl kinase activity and appear to interact with G-proteins, perhaps by causing phosphorylation of them. In type I diabetes, circulating insulin levels are abnormally low, giving rise to gross perturbations of metabolism as well as to a variety of complications such as ionic disturbances, neuropathies of the nervous system, respiratory and cardiovascular aberrations and predisposition to infection. We show here that experimentally-induced type I diabetes leads to the loss of expression of Gi in rat liver. As it has been suggested that Gi may couple receptors to K+-channels as well as mediating the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, aberrations in the control of expression of this key regulatory protein in type I diabetes may be expected to lead to pleiotropic effects.
DARPP-32, a dopamine- and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated phosphoprotein (32 kilodaltons in size), is an obligate intermediate in progesterone (P)-facilitated sexual receptivity in female rats and mice. The facilitative effect of P on sexual receptivity in female rats was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides to DARPP-32. Homozygous mice carrying a null mutation for the DARPP-32 gene exhibited minimal levels of P-facilitated sexual receptivity when compared to their wild-type littermates. P significantly increased hypothalamic cAMP levels and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These increases were not inhibited by a D1 subclass dopamine receptor antagonist. P also enhanced phosphorylation of DARPP-32 on threonine 34 in the hypothalamus of mice. DARPP-32 activation is thus an obligatory step in progestin receptor regulation of sexual receptivity in rats and mice.
Hormones and neurotransmitters may mediate common responses through receptors that couple to the same class of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein. For example, several receptors that couple to Gq class proteins can induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Class-specific inhibition of Gq-mediated signaling was produced in the hearts of transgenic mice by targeted expression of a carboxyl-terminal peptide of the alpha subunit Galphaq. When pressure overload was surgically induced, the transgenic mice developed significantly less ventricular hypertrophy than control animals. The data demonstrate the role of myocardial Gq in the initiation of myocardial hypertrophy and indicate a possible strategy for preventing pathophysiological signaling by simultaneously blocking multiple receptors coupled to Gq.
Defects in the NF1 gene have been implicated in the inherited disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized by several developmental abnormalities including an increased frequency of benign and malignant tumours of neural crest origin (neurofibromas and neurofibrosarcomas respectively). The NF1 gene encodes a ubiquitous protein homologous to p120GAP, the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the products of the ras protooncogenes. When expressed in non-mammalian systems, the region of the NF1 gene homologous to p120GAP produces a protein with GAP-like activity. Here we present evidence that the ras proteins in malignant tumour cell lines from patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis are in a constitutively activated state, as judged by the guanine nucleotide bound to them, and are necessary for cellular proliferation. These cells contain p21ras and p120GAP that are both functionally wild type, but barely any functional NF1 protein. Our results show that the NF1 protein is normally essential for correct negative regulation of ras proteins in the cell, even in the presence of normal p120GAP, and they support the hypothesis that NF1 is a tumour-suppressor gene whose product acts upstream of ras.
In the yeast Sacchromyces cerevisiae, addition of glucose to starved cells triggers a transient rise in the intracellular level of cyclic AMP that induces a protein phosphorylation cascade. The glucose signal is processed by the Cdc25/Ras/adenylyl cyclase pathway, where the role of Cdc25 is to catalyse the GDP-GTP exchange on Ras. The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the activity of Cdc25 are unknown. We report here the use of highly selective anti-Cdc25 antibodies to demonstrate that Cdc25 is a phospho protein and that in response to glucose it is hyperphosphorylated, within seconds, by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. It is also demonstrated that, concomitantly with hyperphosphorylation, Cdc25 partially relocalizes to the cytoplasm, reducing its accessibility to membrane-bound Ras. These results are of general significance because of the highly conserved sequence of Ras-guanyl nucleotide exchange factors from yeasts to mammals.
Homologs of the Yersinia virulence effector YopJ are found in both plant and animal bacterial pathogens, as well as plant symbionts. These YopJ family members were shown to act as cysteine proteases. The catalytic triad of the protease was required for inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling in animal cells and for induction of localized cell death in plants. The substrates for YopJ were shown to be highly conserved ubiquitin-like molecules, which are covalently added to numerous regulatory proteins. YopJ family members exert their pathogenic effect on cells by disrupting this posttranslational modification.
Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is closely related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), their matrix antigens (MAs) sharing some 50% sequence identity. MA is a component of Pr55Gag, the sole protein required for assembly of the virion shell. MA targets Pr55 to the plasma membrane, and facilitates incorporation of the virus envelope protein and assembly of the Pr55Gag shell. Cleavage of Pr55 by the viral protease produces the mature protein of relative molecular mass 17-18K, which underlies the host-derived membrane and is important in both virus entry and nuclear localization of the virion core. Here we report the crystal structure of SIV MA. The molecule forms a trimer consistent with oligomerization in vitro, the observed virion architecture, and various biological properties of MA.
The nitrogen regulatory (NtrC) protein of enteric bacteria, which binds to sites that have the properties of transcriptional enhancers, is known to activate transcription by a form of RNA polymerase that contains the NtrA protein (sigma 54) as sigma factor (referred to as sigma 54-holoenzyme). In the presence of adenosine triphosphate, the NtrC protein catalyzes isomerization of closed recognition complexes between sigma 54-holoenzyme and the glnA promoter to open complexes in which DNA in the region of the transcription start site is locally denatured. NtrC is not required subsequently for maintenance of open complexes or initiation of transcription.
Enzymes use substrate-binding energy both to promote ground-state association and to stabilize the reaction transition state selectively. The monomeric homing endonuclease I-AniI cleaves with high sequence specificity in the centre of a 20-base-pair (bp) DNA target site, with the amino (N)-terminal domain of the enzyme making extensive binding interactions with the left (-) side of the target site and the similarly structured carboxy (C)-terminal domain interacting with the right (+) side. Here we show that, despite the approximate twofold symmetry of the enzyme-DNA complex, there is almost complete segregation of interactions responsible for substrate binding to the (-) side of the interface and interactions responsible for transition-state stabilization to the (+) side. Although single base-pair substitutions throughout the entire DNA target site reduce catalytic efficiency, mutations in the (-) DNA half-site almost exclusively increase the dissociation constant (K(D)) and the Michaelis constant under single-turnover conditions (K(M)*), and those in the (+) half-site primarily decrease the turnover number (k(cat)*). The reduction of activity produced by mutations on the (-) side, but not mutations on the (+) side, can be suppressed by tethering the substrate to the endonuclease displayed on the surface of yeast. This dramatic asymmetry in the use of enzyme-substrate binding energy for catalysis has direct relevance to the redesign of endonucleases to cleave genomic target sites for gene therapy and other applications. Computationally redesigned enzymes that achieve new specificities on the (-) side do so by modulating K(M)*, whereas redesigns with altered specificities on the (+) side modulate k(cat)*. Our results illustrate how classical enzymology and modern protein design can each inform the other.
This article summarizes methods for the synthesis of phosphorodithioate-linked deoxyoligonucleotides and details an analysis of one of the distinctive properties of phosphorodithioate DNA oligomers, their ability to strongly inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT). Mechanistic studies indicate that oligomers of this type interfere with enzyme function by binding tightly to the active site for primer-template, which results in low or subnanomolar inhibitory constants. Although many of these studies have used deoxyoligocytidine analogs, a rationally designed approach has led to the discovery of a very active phosphorodithioate deoxyoligonucleotide inhibitor. This type of inhibitor, which binds strongly to the primer-template active site of HIV-1 RT, provides another type of potential therapeutic agent against HIV-1.
The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates various physiological processes in plants. The molecular mechanisms by which this is achieved are not fully understood. Genetic approaches have characterized several downstream components of ABA signalling, but a receptor for ABA has remained elusive. Although studies indicate that several ABA response genes encode RNA-binding or RNA-processing proteins, none has been found to be functional in binding ABA. Here we show that FCA, an RNA-binding protein involved in flowering, binds ABA with high affinity in an interaction that is stereospecific and follows receptor kinetics. The interaction between FCA and ABA has molecular effects on downstream events in the autonomous floral pathway and, consequently, on the ability of the plant to undergo transition to flowering. We further show that ABA binding exerts a direct control on the FCA-mediated processing of precursor messenger RNA. Our results indicate that FCA is an ABA receptor involved in RNA metabolism and in controlling flowering time.
G protein-coupled receptors represent the largest family of membrane receptors that instigate signalling through nucleotide exchange on heterotrimeric G proteins. Nucleotide exchange, or more precisely, GDP dissociation from the G protein a-subunit, is the key step towards G protein activation and initiation of downstream signalling cascades. Despite a wealth of biochemical and biophysical studies on inactive and active conformations of several heterotrimeric G proteins, the molecular underpinnings of G protein activation remain elusive. To characterize this mechanism, we applied peptide amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe changes in the structure of the heterotrimeric bovine G protein, Gs (the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase) on formation of a complex with agonist-bound human b(2) adrenergic receptor (b(2)AR). Here we report structural links between the receptor-binding surface and the nucleotide-binding pocket of Gs that undergo higher levels of hydrogen-deuterium exchange than would be predicted from the crystal structure of the b(2)AR-Gs complex. Together with X-ray crystallographic and electron microscopic data of the b(2)AR-Gs complex (from refs 2, 3), we provide a rationale for a mechanism of nucleotide exchange, whereby the receptor perturbs the structure of the amino-terminal region of the a-subunit of Gs and consequently alters the 'P-loop' that binds the b-phosphate in GDP. As with the Ras family of small-molecular-weight G proteins, P-loop stabilization and b-phosphate coordination are key determinants of GDP (and GTP) binding affinity.
Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was applied to alter the cleavage site in the signal peptide of the major outer membrane lipoprotein of Escherichia coli. Replacing the glycine residue at the cleavage site with an alanine residue did not affect the processing of the signal peptide. However, when the same cleavage site was constructed by the deletion of the glycine residue, the signal peptide was no longer cleaved. These results indicate that stringent structural integrity at the cleavage site in the lipoprotein signal sequence is required for correct processing of prolipoprotein.
Although BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1) is essential for the generation of amyloid-b peptide in Alzheimer's disease, its physiological function is unclear. We found that very high levels of BACE1 were expressed at time points when peripheral nerves become myelinated. Deficiency of BACE1 resulted in the accumulation of unprocessed neuregulin 1 (NRG1), an axonally expressed factor required for glial cell development and myelination. BACE1-/- mice displayed hypomyelination of peripheral nerves and aberrant axonal segregation of small-diameter afferent fibers, very similar to that seen in mice with mutations in type III NRG1 or Schwann cell-specific ErbB2 knockouts. Thus, BACE1 is required for myelination and correct bundling of axons by Schwann cells, probably through processing of type III NRG1.
All human and murine immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) genes contain the sequence ATGCAAAT approximately 70 nucleotides 5' from the site of transcription initiation. This octanucleotide, in reverse orientation, is also found in all light chain variable region (VL) genes, and in the immunoglobulin heavy chain transcriptional enhancer. Transfection studies have established that this octamer is involved in the lymphoid-specific transcription of immunoglobulin genes. Octamer-containing fragments have been reported to bind a factor present in nuclear extracts of human cell lines; however, identical binding activity was detected in both B lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. Here we establish that nuclear extracts from distinct cell types differ in their ability to interact with octamer-containing fragments. We have also detected a DNA-protein interaction that may be involved in the cell-type specificity of immunoglobulin expression, and we have determined that a sequence upstream of the octamer participates in an interaction with a nuclear protein(s).
Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is an evolutionarily conserved process used by multicellular organisms to eliminate cells that are not needed or are potentially detrimental to the organism. Members of the Bcl-2 family of mammalian proteins are intimately involved in the regulation of apoptosis, but, their precise mechanism of action remains unresolved. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Bcl-2 homologue CED-9 prevents cell death by antagonizing the death-promoting activities of CED-3, a member of the Caspase family of death proteases, and of CED-4, a protein with no known mammalian homologue. Here we show that CED-9 interacts physically with CED-4. Mutations that reduce or eliminate CED-9 activity also disrupt its ability to bind CED-4, suggesting that this interaction is important for CED-9 function. Thus, CED-9 might control C. elegans cell death by binding to and regulating CED-4 activity. We propose that mammalian Bcl-2 family members might control apoptosis in a similar way through interaction and regulation of CED-4 homologues or analogues.
The product of the yeast PRP22 gene acts late in the splicing of yeast pre-messenger RNA, mediating the release of the spliced mRNA from the spliceosome. The predicted PRP22 protein sequence shares extensive homology with that of PRP2 and PRP16 proteins, which are also involved in nuclear pre-mRNA splicing. The homologous region contains sequence elements characteristic of several demonstrated or putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases. A putative RNA-binding motif originally identified in bacterial ribosomal protein S1 and Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase has also been found in PRP22.
Insulin and related peptides are key hormonal integrators of growth and metabolism in vertebrates. There is little biochemical evidence for insulin-related peptides in invertebrates, apart from insects for which definitive structural information on these peptides (prothoracicotropic hormone, PTTH) has recently been obtained. We report here the first complete complementary DNA-derived primary structure of a preproinsulin-related protein from identified neurons in an invertebrate, the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis. We have demonstrated by in situ hybridization that transcription of the gene for this molluscan insulin-related peptide (MIP) occurs in the cerebral light-green cells, giant neuroendocrine cells involved in the control of growth, as well as in a pair of neuroendocrine cells called the canopy cells. The insulin-related peptide precursor has the same overall structure as its vertebrate counterparts. The discovery of insulin-related peptides in invertebrates substantiates the evidence for a widespread and early evolutionary origin of the insulin superfamily.
Phosphoinositide-3 kinase activity is implicated in diverse cellular responses triggered by mammalian cell surface receptors and in the regulation of protein sorting in yeast. Receptors with intrinsic and associated tyrosine kinase activity recruit heterodimeric phosphoinositide-3 kinases that consist of p110 catalytic subunits and p85 adaptor molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. A phosphoinositide-3 kinase isotype, p110 gamma, was cloned and characterized. The p110 gamma enzyme was activated in vitro by both the alpha and beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G proteins) and did not interact with p85. A potential pleckstrin homology domain is located near its amino terminus. The p110 gamma isotype may link signaling through G protein-coupled receptors to the generation of phosphoinositide second messengers phosphorylated in the D-3 position.
Overexpression of the D2 dopamine receptor has been proposed to be part of the pathology of schizophrenia. The isolation of a D2 dopamine receptor clone has assisted the molecular characterization of D2 receptor. We have now isolated an identical rat clone along with two other clones--a second related rat clone (RD-2in) and a homologous bovine clone (BD-2in), both of which contain an insert encoding an additional 29 amino acids relative to the original rat clone (RD-2o). All three clones encode D2 receptor binding sites when expressed in COS-7 cells. The amino-acid insert encoded by D-2in lies in the domain of the receptor believed to interact with the GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) of various signal transduction pathways. By using oligonucleotide probes specific for either D-2o or D-2in RNA transcripts, we have found that the level of expression of the D-2in-encoded form of the receptor is seven times that of the D-2o form in the caudate nucleus, the richest brain source of D2 receptors.
Messenger RNA lacking stop codons ('non-stop mRNA') can arise from errors in gene expression, and encode aberrant proteins whose accumulation could be deleterious to cellular function. In bacteria, these 'non-stop proteins' become co-translationally tagged with a peptide encoded by ssrA/tmRNA (transfer-messenger RNA), which signals their degradation by energy-dependent proteases. How eukaryotic cells eliminate non-stop proteins has remained unknown. Here we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ltn1 RING-domain-type E3 ubiquitin ligase acts in the quality control of non-stop proteins, in a process that is mechanistically distinct but conceptually analogous to that performed by ssrA: Ltn1 is predominantly associated with ribosomes, and it marks nascent non-stop proteins with ubiquitin to signal their proteasomal degradation. Ltn1-mediated ubiquitylation of non-stop proteins seems to be triggered by their stalling in ribosomes on translation through the poly(A) tail. The biological relevance of this process is underscored by the finding that loss of Ltn1 function confers sensitivity to stress caused by increased non-stop protein production. We speculate that defective protein quality control may underlie the neurodegenerative phenotype that results from mutation of the mouse Ltn1 homologue Listerin.
Signal transducing guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins are heterotrimers with different alpha subunits that confer specificity for interactions with receptors and effectors. Eight to ten such G proteins couple a large number of receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters to at least eight different effectors. Although one G protein can interact with several receptors, a given G protein was thought to interact with but one effector. The recent finding that voltage-gated calcium channels are stimulated by purified Gs, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase, challenged this concept. However, purified Gs may have four distinct alpha-subunit polypeptides, produced by alternative splicing of messenger RNA. By using recombinant DNA techniques, three of the splice variants were synthesized in Escherichia coli and each variant was shown to stimulate both adenylyl cyclase and calcium channels. Thus, a single G protein alpha subunit may regulate more than one effector function.
N-myc, a cellular gene related to the c-myc proto-oncogene, was originally identified on the basis of its very frequent amplification and overexpression in a restricted set of tumours, most notably human neuroblastomas. That N-myc may have a causal role in the genesis of these tumours is suggested by the observation that in the rat embryo fibroblast co-transformation assay it has a transforming potential similar to that of c-myc. The apparent structural and functional homology of N-myc and c-myc suggests that they may be members of the same protooncogene family. However, despite these apparent similarities, expression of the two genes appears to be dramatically different with respect to tumour specificity, as well as tissue and developmental stage specificity. To further elucidate the common and unique aspects of N-myc and c-myc gene structure and function in normal and transformed cells, we have determined the organization of human N-myc and the nucleotide sequence of its messenger product, and we report here that N-myc and c-myc have a similar intron/exon structure and that their protein products share regions of significant homology.
A diploid organism has two copies of each gene, one inherited from each parent. The expression of two inherited alleles is sometimes biased by the effects known as dominant/recessive relationships, which determine the final phenotype of the organism. To explore the mechanisms underlying these relationships, we have examined the monoallelic expression of S-locus protein 11 genes (SP11), which encode the male determinants of self-incompatibility in Brassica. We previously reported that SP11 expression was monoallelic in some S heterozygotes, and that the promoter regions of recessive SP11 alleles were specifically methylated in the anther tapetum. Here we show that this methylation is controlled by trans-acting small non-coding RNA (sRNA). We identified inverted genomic sequences that were similar to the recessive SP11 promoters in the flanking regions of dominant SP11 alleles. These sequences were specifically expressed in the anther tapetum and processed into 24-nucleotide sRNA, named SP11 methylation inducer (Smi). Introduction of the Smi genomic region into the recessive S homozygotes triggered the methylation of the promoter of recessive SP11 alleles and repressed their transcription. This is an example showing sRNA encoded in the flanking region of a dominant allele acts in trans to induce transcriptional silencing of the recessive allele. Our finding may provide new insights into the widespread monoallelic gene expression systems.
Mutations affecting the BRCT domains of the breast cancer-associated tumor suppressor BRCA1 disrupt the recruitment of this protein to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The molecular structures at DSBs recognized by BRCA1 are presently unknown. We report the interaction of the BRCA1 BRCT domain with RAP80, a ubiquitin-binding protein. RAP80 targets a complex containing the BRCA1-BARD1 (BRCA1-associated ring domain protein 1) E3 ligase and the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) BRCC36 to MDC1-gammaH2AX-dependent lysine(6)- and lysine(63)-linked ubiquitin polymers at DSBs. These events are required for cell cycle checkpoint and repair responses to ionizing radiation, implicating ubiquitin chain recognition and turnover in the BRCA1-mediated repair of DSBs.
Electrostatic effects dominate many aspects of protein behavior. When polypeptide chains fold up, most polar side chains seek the exterior, where they can be solvated. Water bound in the interior has been found between the domains of enzymes of the chymotrypsin family, and between the subunits of hemoglobin and tobacco mosaic virus protein. Assembly of this protein from disk to virus is triggered by electrostatic interactions between neighboring subunits. Lysozyme stabilizes the constellation of charges involved in the transition state of its substrate by both permanent and induced dipoles. All factors that lower the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin act by strengthening the salt bridges that constrain its quaternary deoxy (T) structure. Enzymes of thermophile bacteria owe their extra stability mostly to additional salt bridges. The rate of denaturation of hemoglobins by alkali is determined by the ionization of internal side chains with pK's of about 12.
Classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease whose defective gene has remained elusive. A molecular basis for LINCL was determined with an approach applicable to other lysosomal storage diseases. When the mannose 6-phosphate modification of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes was used as an affinity marker, a single protein was identified that is absent in LINCL. Sequence comparisons suggest that this protein is a pepstatin-insensitive lysosomal peptidase, and a corresponding enzymatic activity was deficient in LINCL autopsy specimens. Mutations in the gene encoding this protein were identified in LINCL patients but not in normal controls.
Post-translational modification by ubiquitin-like proteins (Ublps) is an essential cellular regulatory mechanism. The Ublp NEDD8 regulates cell division, signalling and embryogenesis. Ublps are conjugated to their targets by the sequential action of E1, E2 and often E3 enzymes. Each Ublp has a dedicated E1, or activating enzyme, that initiates its conjugation cascade. First, E1 associates with the Ublp and catalyses adenylation of the carboxy terminus of the Ublp. Second, E1 forms a thioester between its catalytic cysteine and the Ublp. Next, E1 is loaded with a second Ublp molecule, adenylating the C terminus of this second Ublp while still carrying the first thioester-bound Ublp. Last, E1 binds E2 and promotes Ublp transfer to the catalytic cysteine of E2. We report here the structure and mutational analysis of human APPBP1-UBA3, the heterodimeric E1 enzyme for NEDD8 (ref. 11). Each E1 activity is specified by a domain: an adenylation domain resembling bacterial adenylating enzymes, an E1-specific domain organized around the catalytic cysteine, and a domain involved in E2 recognition resembling ubiquitin. The domains are arranged around two clefts that coordinate protein and nucleotide binding so that each of E1's reactions drives the next, in an assembly-line fashion.
Starting from restriction enzyme cleavage sites of known topologies the DNA sequences coding for two thirds of the H2B histone protein, together with some 3 inch extracistronic sequences, have been determined for the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris. This unambiguously identifies this gene and further reveals its 5 inch-3inch polarity and accurate map position in a cloned histone DNA repeat unit.
The administration of leptin to leptin-deficient humans, and the analogous Lepob/Lepob mice, effectively reduces hyperphagia and obesity. But common obesity is associated with elevated leptin, which suggests that obese humans are resistant to this adipocyte hormone. In addition to regulating long-term energy balance, leptin also rapidly affects neuronal activity. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide-Y types of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are both principal sites of leptin receptor expression and the source of potent neuropeptide modulators, melanocortins and neuropeptide Y, which exert opposing effects on feeding and metabolism. These neurons are therefore ideal for characterizing leptin action and the mechanism of leptin resistance; however, their diffuse distribution makes them difficult to study. Here we report electrophysiological recordings on POMC neurons, which we identified by targeted expression of green fluorescent protein in transgenic mice. Leptin increases the frequency of action potentials in the anorexigenic POMC neurons by two mechanisms: depolarization through a nonspecific cation channel; and reduced inhibition by local orexigenic neuropeptide-Y/GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurons. Furthermore, we show that melanocortin peptides have an autoinhibitory effect on this circuit. On the basis of our results, we propose an integrated model of leptin action and neuronal architecture in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.
The seminal importance of DNA sequencing to the life sciences, biotechnology and medicine has driven the search for more scalable and lower-cost solutions. Here we describe a DNA sequencing technology in which scalable, low-cost semiconductor manufacturing techniques are used to make an integrated circuit able to directly perform non-optical DNA sequencing of genomes. Sequence data are obtained by directly sensing the ions produced by template-directed DNA polymerase synthesis using all-natural nucleotides on this massively parallel semiconductor-sensing device or ion chip. The ion chip contains ion-sensitive, field-effect transistor-based sensors in perfect register with 1.2 million wells, which provide confinement and allow parallel, simultaneous detection of independent sequencing reactions. Use of the most widely used technology for constructing integrated circuits, the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, allows for low-cost, large-scale production and scaling of the device to higher densities and larger array sizes. We show the performance of the system by sequencing three bacterial genomes, its robustness and scalability by producing ion chips with up to 10 times as many sensors and sequencing a human genome.
Activities of the five hepatic enzymes of the urea cycle increased two- to threefold in monkeys on a 60 percent protein diet compared with levels in monkeys on an isocaloric 6 percent protein diet. Equal adaptation occurred in rats on the same diets. These enzyme activities in adult humans approximate those of monkeys on a similar protein intake.
The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that of prion disorders (PrD) could not be more different. One-third of octogenarians succumb to AD, whereas Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease typically affects one individual in a million each year. However, these diseases have many common features impinging on the metabolism of neuronal membrane proteins: the amyloid precursor protein APP in the case of AD, and the cellular prion protein PrPC in PrD. APP begets the Abeta peptide, whereas PrPC begets the malignant prion protein PrPSc. Both Abeta and PrPSc are associated with disease, but we do not know what triggers their accumulation and neurotoxicity. A great deal has been learned, however, about protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation; an entirely new class of intramembrane proteases has been identified; and unsuspected roles for the immune system have been uncovered. There is reason to expect that prion research will profit from advances in the understanding of AD, and vice versa.
Signal transduction is controlled both by regulation of enzyme activation and by organization of enzymatic complexes with nonenzymatic adapters, scaffolds, and anchor proteins. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is one of several evolutionarily conserved mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades important in the regulation of growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. A two-hybrid screen was conducted to identify nonenzymatic components of this signaling cascade that might be important in regulating its activity. A protein called MP1 (MEK Partner 1) was identified that bound specifically to MEK1 and ERK1 and facilitated their activation. When overexpressed in cultured cells, MP1 enhanced activation of ERK1 and activation of a reporter driven by the transcription factor Elk-1. Expression of MP1 in cells increased binding of ERK1 to MEK1. MP1 apparently functions as an adapter to enhance the efficiency of the MAP kinase cascade.
Photolyase repairs ultraviolet (UV) damage to DNA by splitting the cyclobutane ring of the major UV photoproduct, the cis, syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (Pyr <> Pyr). The reaction is initiated by blue light and proceeds through long-range energy transfer, single electron transfer, and enzyme catalysis by a radical mechanism. The three-dimensional crystallographic structure of DNA photolyase from Escherichia coli is presented and the atomic model was refined to an R value of 0.172 at 2.3 A resolution. The polypeptide chain of 471 amino acids is folded into an amino-terminal alpha/beta domain resembling dinucleotide binding domains and a carboxyl-terminal helical domain; a loop of 72 residues connects the domains. The light-harvesting cofactor 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate (MTHF) binds in a cleft between the two domains. Energy transfer from MTHF to the catalytic cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) occurs over a distance of 16.8 A. The FAD adopts a U-shaped conformation between two helix clusters in the center of the helical domain and is accessible through a hole in the surface of this domain. Dimensions and polarity of the hole match those of a Pyr <> Pyr dinucleotide, suggesting that the Pyr <> Pyr "flips out" of the helix to fit into this hole, and that electron transfer between the flavin and the Pyr <> Pyr occurs over van der Waals contact distance.
The discovery of the RNA self-splicing group I intron provided the first demonstration that not all enzymes are proteins. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure (3.1-A resolution) of a complete group I bacterial intron in complex with both the 5'- and the 3'-exons. This complex corresponds to the splicing intermediate before the exon ligation step. It reveals how the intron uses structurally unprecedented RNA motifs to select the 5'- and 3'-splice sites. The 5'-exon's 3'-OH is positioned for inline nucleophilic attack on the conformationally constrained scissile phosphate at the intron-3'-exon junction. Six phosphates from three disparate RNA strands converge to coordinate two metal ions that are asymmetrically positioned on opposing sides of the reactive phosphate. This structure represents the first splicing complex to include a complete intron, both exons and an organized active site occupied with metal ions.
The picornavirus family includes several pathogens such as poliovirus, rhinovirus (the major cause of the common cold), hepatitis A virus and the foot-and-mouth disease virus. Picornaviral proteins are expressed by direct translation of the genomic RNA into a single, large polyprotein precursor. Proteolysis of the viral polyprotein into the mature proteins is assured by the viral 3C enzymes, which are cysteine proteinases. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure at 2.3 A resolution of the 3C proteinase from hepatitis A virus (HAV-3C). The overall architecture of HAV-3C reveals a fold resembling that of the chymotrypsin family of serine proteinases, which is consistent with earlier predictions. Catalytic residues include Cys 172 as nucleophile and His 44 as general base. The 3C cleavage specificity for glutamine residues is defined primarily by His 191. The overall structure suggests that an intermolecular (trans) cleavage releases 3C and that there is an active proteinase in the polyprotein.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have critical roles in the regulation of gene expression; however, as miRNA activity requires base pairing with only 6-8 nucleotides of messenger RNA, predicting target mRNAs is a major challenge. Recently, high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) has identified functional protein-RNA interaction sites. Here we use HITS-CLIP to covalently crosslink native argonaute (Ago, also called Eif2c) protein-RNA complexes in mouse brain. This produced two simultaneous data sets-Ago-miRNA and Ago-mRNA binding sites-that were combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify interaction sites between miRNA and target mRNA. We validated genome-wide interaction maps for miR-124, and generated additional maps for the 20 most abundant miRNAs present in P13 mouse brain. Ago HITS-CLIP provides a general platform for exploring the specificity and range of miRNA action in vivo, and identifies precise sequences for targeting clinically relevant miRNA-mRNA interactions.
The [URE3] non-Mendelian genetic element of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an infectious protein (prion) form of Ure2p, a regulator of nitrogen catabolism. Here, synthetic Ure2p1-65 were shown to polymerize to form filaments 40 to 45 angstroms in diameter with more than 60 percent beta sheet. Ure2p1-65 specifically induced full-length native Ure2p to copolymerize under conditions where native Ure2p alone did not polymerize. Like Ure2p in extracts of [URE3] strains, these 180- to 220-angstrom-diameter filaments were protease resistant. The Ure2p1-65-Ure2p cofilaments could seed polymerization of native Ure2p to form thicker, less regular filaments. All filaments stained with Congo Red to produce the green birefringence typical of amyloid. This self-propagating amyloid formation can explain the properties of [URE3].
Shortened forms of the group I intron from Tetrahymena catalyse sequence-specific cleavage of exogenous oligonucleotide substrates. The association between RNA enzyme (ribozyme) and substrate is mediated by pairing between an internal guide sequence on the ribozyme and a complementary sequence on the substrate. RNA substrates and cleavage products associate with a binding energy greater than that of base-pairing by approximately 4 kcal-mol-1 (at 42 degrees C), whereas DNA associates with an energy around that expected for base-pairing. It has been proposed that the difference in binding affinity is due to specific 2'-OH groups on an RNA substrate forming stabilizing tertiary interactions with the core of the ribozyme, or that the RNA.RNA helix formed upon association of an RNA substrate and the ribozyme might be more stable than an RNA.DNA helix of the same sequence. To differentiate between these two models, chimaeric oligonucleotides containing deoxynucleotide residues at successive positions along the chain were synthesized, and their equilibrium binding constants for association with the ribozyme were measured directly by a new gel electrophoresis technique. We report here that most of the extra binding energy can be accounted for by discrete RNA-ribozyme interactions, the 2'-OH group on the sugar residue three nucleotides from the cleavage site contributing the most interaction energy. Thus, in addition to the well documented binding of RNA to RNA by base-pairing, 2'-OH groups within a duplex can also mediate association between RNA molecules.
Activator proteins that control transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II usually have two domains: one binds to DNA, and the other activates transcription. A particularly potent acidic activation domain at the C terminus of the herpes simplex virus protein VP16 binds directly and selectively to the human and yeast TATA box-binding factor TFIID. We have now investigated the biological significance of this in vitro interaction by using mutant forms of VP16. For changes at the critical phenylalanine residue at position 442 of VP16 there was a good correlation between transactivation activity in vivo and the binding of VP16 to TFIID in vitro. In contrast, mutants with reduced negative charge were more defective for binding than for activation.
The beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors (betaARs) on the surface of cardiomyocytes mediate distinct effects on cardiac function and the development of heart failure by regulating production of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The spatial localization in cardiomyocytes of these betaARs, which are coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), and the functional implications of their localization have been unclear. We combined nanoscale live-cell scanning ion conductance and fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy techniques and found that, in cardiomyocytes from healthy adult rats and mice, spatially confined beta2AR-induced cAMP signals are localized exclusively to the deep transverse tubules, whereas functional beta1ARs are distributed across the entire cell surface. In cardiomyocytes derived from a rat model of chronic heart failure, beta2ARs were redistributed from the transverse tubules to the cell crest, which led to diffuse receptor-mediated cAMP signaling. Thus, the redistribution of beta(2)ARs in heart failure changes compartmentation of cAMP and might contribute to the failing myocardial phenotype.
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) adenosine triphosphatases actively transport a wide variety of compounds across biological membranes. Here, the ABC protein Mdl1 was identified as an intracellular peptide transporter localized in the inner membrane of yeast mitochondria. Mdl1 was required for mitochondrial export of peptides with molecular masses of approximately 2100 to 600 daltons generated by proteolysis of inner-membrane proteins by the m-AAA protease in the mitochondrial matrix. Proteolysis by the i-AAA protease in the intermembrane space led to the release of similar-sized peptides independent of Mdl1. Thus, two pathways of peptide efflux from mitochondria exist that may allow communication between mitochondria and their cellular environment.
Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels are multimeric proteins that activate in response to the binding of cyclic nucleotide to intracellular domains. Here, an intramolecular protein-protein interaction between the amino-terminal domain and the carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain of the rat olfactory CNG channel was shown to exert an autoexcitatory effect on channel activation. Calcium-calmodulin, which modulates CNG channel activity during odorant adaptation, blocked this interaction. A specific deletion within the amino-terminal domain disrupted the interdomain interaction in vitro and altered the gating properties and calmodulin sensitivity of expressed channels. Thus, the amino-terminal domain may promote channel opening by directly interacting with the carboxyl-terminal gating machinery; calmodulin regulates channel activity by targeting this interaction.
Peptide bond formation is the principal reaction of protein synthesis. It takes place in the peptidyl transferase centre of the large (50S) ribosomal subunit. In the course of the reaction, the polypeptide is transferred from peptidyl transfer RNA to the alpha-amino group of amino acyl-tRNA. The crystallographic structure of the 50S subunit showed no proteins within 18 A from the active site, revealing peptidyl transferase as an RNA enzyme. Reported unique structural and biochemical features of the universally conserved adenine residue A2451 in 23S ribosomal RNA (Escherichia coli numbering) led to the proposal of a mechanism of rRNA catalysis that implicates this nucleotide as the principal catalytic residue. In vitro genetics allowed us to test the importance of A2451 for the overall rate of peptide bond formation. Here we report that large ribosomal subunits with mutated A2451 showed significant peptidyl transferase activity in several independent assays. Mutations at another nucleotide, G2447, which is essential to render catalytic properties to A2451 (refs 2, 3), also did not dramatically change the transpeptidation activity. As alterations of the putative catalytic residues do not severely affect the rate of peptidyl transfer the ribosome apparently promotes transpeptidation not through chemical catalysis, but by properly positioning the substrates of protein synthesis.
The rational design of drugs that can inhibit the action of viral proteases depends on obtaining accurate structures of these enzymes. The crystal structure of chemically synthesized HIV-1 protease has been determined at 2.8 angstrom resolution (R factor of 0.184) with the use of a model based on the Rous sarcoma virus protease structure. In this enzymatically active protein, the cysteines were replaced by alpha-amino-n-butyric acid, a nongenetically coded amino acid. This structure, in which all 99 amino acids were located, differs in several important details from that reported previously by others. The interface between the identical subunits forming the active protease dimer is composed of four well-ordered beta strands from both the amino and carboxyl termini and residues 86 to 94 have a helical conformation. The observed arrangement of the dimer interface suggests possible designs for dimerization inhibitors.
The serpins are a widely distributed family of proteins with diverse functions; they include the key serine protease inhibitors of human plasma as well as noninhibitory homologues such as hormone-binding globulins, angiotensinogen and egg-white ovalbumin. Sequence alignment based on the crystal structure. On the cleaved form of the archetypal serpin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, indicates that the serpins share a common highly ordered structure. On cleavage of the reactive centre peptide bond, they characteristically undergo a remarkable conformational change, the newly generated C terminus moving some 70 A to the opposite pole of the molecule. The structure of this post-cleavage form is known, but the conformation of the intact serpins and in particular that of their reactive centre is not. Wright et al.'s structure of plakalbumin (ovalbumin cleaved by subtilisin) has provided evidence for the conformational change that results from cleavage. We have now determined the structure of native ovalbumin to 1.95 A resolution and have found that the intact peptide loop forming the analogue to the reactive centre of the inhibitory serpins takes the unexpected form of a protruding, isolated helix. This model of the intact structures of the serpins suggests how they may interact with their target proteases.
Acute traumatic stress may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by delayed neuropsychiatric symptoms including depression, irritability, and impaired cognitive performance. Curiously, inhibitors of the acetylcholine-hydrolysing enzyme acetylcholinesterase may induce psychopathologies that are reminiscent of PTSD. It is unknown how a single stressful event mediates long-term neuronal plasticity. Moreover, no mechanism has been proposed to explain the convergent neuropsychological outcomes of stress and of acetylcholinesterase inhibition. However, acute stress elicits a transient increase in the amounts released of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a phase of enhanced neuronal excitability. Inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase also promote enhanced electrical brain activity, presumably by increasing the survival of acetylcholine at the synapse. Here we report that there is similar bidirectional modulation of genes that regulate acetylcholine availability after stress and blockade of acetylcholinesterase. These calcium-dependent changes in gene expression coincide with phases of rapid enhancement and delayed depression of neuronal excitability. Both of these phases are mediated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Our results suggest a model in which robust cholinergic stimulation triggers rapid induction of the gene encoding the transcription factor c-Fos. This protein then mediates selective regulatory effects on the long-lasting activities of genes involved in acetylcholine metabolism.
Mutations in proteins of the Drosophila phototransduction cascade, a prototypic guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor signaling system, lead to retinal degeneration and have been used as models to understand human degenerative disorders. Here, modulating the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway rescued retinal degeneration in Drosophila mutants. Targeted expression of Drosophila neutral ceramidase rescued retinal degeneration in arrestin and phospholipase C mutants. Decreasing flux through the de novo sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway also suppressed degeneration in these mutants. Both genetic backgrounds modulated the endocytic machinery because they suppressed defects in a dynamin mutant. Suppression of degeneration in arrestin mutant flies expressing ceramidase correlated with a decrease in ceramide levels. Thus, enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism may be suitable targets in the therapeutic management of retinal degeneration.
The Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit, an animal with familial hypercholesterolemia, produces a mutant receptor for plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that is not transported to the cell surface at a normal rate. Cloning and sequencing of complementary DNA's from normal and WHHL rabbits, shows that this defect arises from an in-frame deletion of 12 nucleotides that eliminates four amino acids from the cysteine-rich ligand binding domain of the LDL receptor. A similar mutation, detected by S1 nuclease mapping of LDL receptor messenger RNA, occurred in a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia whose receptor also fails to be transported to the cell surface. These findings suggest that animal cells may have fail-safe mechanisms that prevent the surface expression of improperly folded proteins with unpaired or improperly bonded cysteine residues.
The breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA2 controls the function of RAD51, a recombinase enzyme, in pathways for DNA repair by homologous recombination. We report here the structure of a complex between an evolutionarily conserved sequence in BRCA2 (the BRC repeat) and the RecA-homology domain of RAD51. The BRC repeat mimics a motif in RAD51 that serves as an interface for oligomerization between individual RAD51 monomers, thus enabling BRCA2 to control the assembly of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, which is essential for strand-pairing reactions during DNA recombination. The RAD51 oligomerization motif is highly conserved among RecA-like recombinases, highlighting a common evolutionary origin for the mechanism of nucleoprotein filament formation, mirrored in the BRC repeat. Cancer-associated mutations that affect the BRC repeat disrupt its predicted interaction with RAD51, yielding structural insight into mechanisms for cancer susceptibility.
The pattern of messenger RNA synthesis in suspension-cultured bean cells (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was analyzed by blot hybridization and in vitro translation of newly synthesized messenger RNA. The RNA was separated from preexisting RNA by organomercurial affinity chromatography after in vivo labeling with 4-thiouridine. The elicitor induced the synthesis of messenger RNA's encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, chalcone synthase, and chalcone isomerase, three enzymes of phenylpropanoid metabolism involved in the synthesis of isoflavonoidderived phytoalexins. This is part of a rapid and extensive change in the pattern of messenger RNA synthesis directing production of a set of proteins associated with expression of disease resistance.
Tn syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease in which subpopulations of blood cells in all lineages carry an incompletely glycosylated membrane glycoprotein, known as the Tn antigen. This truncated antigen has the sugar N-acetylgalactosamine alpha-linked to either a serine or threonine amino-acid residue, whereas the correct T antigen has an additional terminal galactose; the defect may be due to a malfunction of the glycosylating enzyme T-synthase. Here we show that Tn syndrome is associated with a somatic mutation in Cosmc, a gene on the X chromosome that encodes a molecular 'chaperone' that is required for the proper folding and hence full activity of T-synthase. The production of the autoimmune Tn antigen by a glycosyltransferase enzyme rendered defective by a disabled chaperone may have implications for other Tn-related disorders such as IgA nephropathy, a condition that can result in renal failure.
The discovery of artemisinin more than 30 years ago provided a completely new antimalarial structural prototype; that is, a molecule with a pharmacophoric peroxide bond in a unique 1,2,4-trioxane heterocycle. Available evidence suggests that artemisinin and related peroxidic antimalarial drugs exert their parasiticidal activity subsequent to reductive activation by haem, released as a result of haemoglobin digestion by the malaria-causing parasite. This irreversible redox reaction produces carbon-centred free radicals, leading to alkylation of haem and proteins (enzymes), one of which--the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase PfATP6 (ref. 7)--may be critical to parasite survival. Notably, there is no evidence of drug resistance to any member of the artemisinin family of drugs. The chemotherapy of malaria has benefited greatly from the semi-synthetic artemisinins artemether and artesunate as they rapidly reduce parasite burden, have good therapeutic indices and provide for successful treatment outcomes. However, as a drug class, the artemisinins suffer from chemical (semi-synthetic availability, purity and cost), biopharmaceutical (poor bioavailability and limiting pharmacokinetics) and treatment (non-compliance with long treatment regimens and recrudescence) issues that limit their therapeutic potential. Here we describe how a synthetic peroxide antimalarial drug development candidate was identified in a collaborative drug discovery project.
The A4 protein (or beta-protein) is a 42- or 43-amino-acid peptide present in the extracellular neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease and is derived from a membrane-bound amyloid protein precursor (APP). Three forms of APP have been described and are referred to as APP695, APP751 and APP770, reflecting the number of amino acids encoded for by their respective complementary DNAs. The two larger APPs contain a 57-amino-acid insert with striking homology to the Kunitz family of protease inhibitors. Here we report that the deduced amino-terminal sequence of APP is identical to the sequence of a cell-secreted protease inhibitor, protease nexin-II (PN-II). To confirm this finding, APP751 and APP695 cDNAs were over-expressed in the human 293 cell line, and the secreted N-terminal extracellular domains of these APPs were purified to near homogeneity from the tissue-culture medium. The relative molecular mass and high-affinity binding to dextran sulphate of secreted APP751 were consistent with that of PN-II. Functionally, secreted APP751 formed stable, non-covalent, inhibitory complexes with trypsin. Secreted APP695 did not form complexes with trypsin. We conclude that the secreted form of APP with the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain is PN-II.
Dimerization is a biological regulatory mechanism employed by both soluble and membrane proteins. However, there are few structural data on the factors that govern dimerization of membrane proteins. Outer membrane phospholipase A (OMPLA) is an integral membrane enzyme which participates in secretion of colicins in Escherichia coli. In Campilobacter and Helicobacter pylori strains, OMPLA is implied in virulence. Its activity is regulated by reversible dimerization. Here we report X-ray structures of monomeric and dimeric OMPLA from E. coli. Dimer interactions occur almost exclusively in the apolar membrane-embedded parts, with two hydrogen bonds within the hydrophobic membrane area being key interactions. Dimerization results in functional oxyanion holes and substrate-binding pockets, which are absent in monomeric OMPLA. These results provide a detailed view of activation by dimerization of a membrane protein.
During protein biosynthesis, nascent polypeptide chains that emerge from the ribosomal exit tunnel encounter ribosome-associated chaperones, which assist their folding to the native state. Here we present a 2.7 A crystal structure of Escherichia coli trigger factor, the best-characterized chaperone of this type, together with the structure of its ribosome-binding domain in complex with the Haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal subunit. Trigger factor adopts a unique conformation resembling a crouching dragon with separated domains forming the amino-terminal ribosome-binding 'tail', the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase 'head', the carboxy-terminal 'arms' and connecting regions building up the 'back'. From its attachment point on the ribosome, trigger factor projects the extended domains over the exit of the ribosomal tunnel, creating a protected folding space where nascent polypeptides may be shielded from proteases and aggregation. This study sheds new light on our understanding of co-translational protein folding, and suggests an unexpected mechanism of action for ribosome-associated chaperones.
The controversy surrounding the idea that neutral mutations dominate protein evolution is attributable in part to the inadequacy of the tools available to evolutionary investigators. With a few exceptions, most investigations into the force driving protein evolution have relied on indirect criteria for distinguishing neutral and non-neutral variants. To investigate a particular pathway of molecular evolution, we have reconstructed by site-directed mutagenesis likely ancestral variants of the lysozymes of modern game birds (order Galliformes), tested their activity and thermostability and determined their three-dimensional structure. We focused on amino acids at three positions that are occupied in all known game birds either by the triplet Thr 40, Ile 55, Ser 91, or by the triplet Ser 40, Val 55, Thr 91. We have synthesized proteins representing intermediates along the possible three-step evolutionary pathways between these triplets. Although all of these are active and stable, none of these intermediates is found in known lysozymes. A comparison of the structures and thermostabilities of the variants reveals a linear correlation between the side-chain volume of the triplet and the thermostability of the protein. Each pathway connecting the two extant triplet sequences includes a variant with a thermostability outside the range of the extant proteins. This observation is consistent with a non-neutral evolutionary pathway. The existence of variants that are more stable than the extant proteins suggests that selection for maximum thermostability may not have been an important factor in the evolution of this enzyme.
Cysteine proteinases are important not only in the intracellular catabolism of peptides and proteins and in the processing of prohormones and proenzymes, but also in the penetration of normal human tissue by malignant cells and possibly microorganisms, including viruses. Cystatin C is a human cysteine proteinase inhibitor present in extracellular fluids. We have synthesized peptide derivatives mimicking the proposed proteinase-binding centre of cystatin C and find that they irreversibly inhibit cysteine proteinases. Several bacteria produce proteinases, so we tested a tripeptide derivative (Z-LVG-CHN2) for in vitro anti-bacterial activity against a large number of bacterial strains belonging to thirteen different species. It was found to inhibit specifically the growth of all strains of group A streptococci. The susceptibility of these human pathogens to the peptide was compared with that to well-established anti-streptococcal antibiotics such as tetracycline and bacitracin. Moreover, the peptide was active in vivo against group A streptococci: mice injected with lethal doses of these bacteria were cured by a single injection of Z-LVG-CHN2. The cysteine proteinase produced by group A streptococci was isolated and found to be inhibited by Z-LVG-CHN2; moreover, excess proteinase relieved the growth inhibition caused by the peptide derivative, suggesting that the antibacterial activity of Z-LVG-CHN2 is due to inhibition of this cysteine proteinase. This strategy of blocking proteinases with peptide derivatives that mimic naturally occurring inhibitors could be useful in the construction of new agents against other microorganisms, including viruses.
The immunological properties of the erythrocyte catalase of mice-normal (wild type) strain, one lacking catalase (acatalasemic), and four with only slight catalase activity (hypocatalasemic strains)-have been investigated. Agardiffusion tests and antigen titration of red-cell lysates against rabbit antiserum to catalase from normal mouse blood showed that immunologically identical catalase protein was present in large amounts in the acatalasemic as well as in the hypocatalasemic mutant strains. Despite lack of catalatic activity, the erythrocytes lacking catalase as well as those with only a little catalase contain catalase protein that has been modified at the site of enzyme activity, although the antigenic determinants are identical with those of normal catalase protein. This mutation is purely structural, being characterized by modification of the enzyme active site but not of the antigenic site.
A eukaryotic chromosome contains many genes, each transcribed separately by RNA polymerase (pol) I, II or III. Transcription termination between genes prevents the formation of polycistronic RNAs and anti-sense RNAs, which are generally detrimental to the correct expression of genes. Terminating the transcription of protein-coding genes by pol II requires a group of proteins that also direct cleavage and polyadenylation of the messenger RNA in response to a specific sequence element, and are associated with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of pol II (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). By contrast, the cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that direct termination of non-polyadenylated transcripts made by pol II, including small nucleolar and small nuclear RNAs, are not known. Here we show that read-through transcription from yeast small nucleolar RNA and small nuclear RNA genes into adjacent genes is prevented by a cis-acting element that is recognized, in part, by the essential RNA-binding protein Nrd1. The RNA-binding protein Nab3, the putative RNA helicase Sen1, and the intact C-terminal domain of pol II are also required for efficient response to the element. The same proteins are required for maintaining normal levels of Nrd1 mRNA, indicating that these proteins may control elongation of a subset of mRNA transcripts.
A central event in transcription is the assembly on DNA of specific complexes near the initiation sites for RNA synthesis. Activation of transcription by one class of enhancer-binding proteins requires an RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the specialized transcription factor, sigma-54 (sigma 54). We report here that sigma 54 alone specifically binds to promoter DNA and is responsible for many of the close contacts between RNA polymerase holoenzyme and promoter DNA, a property proposed for the major sigma 70 protein family. Binding of sigma 54 to promoter DNA is not equivalent to that of holoenzyme suggesting that there is a constraint on sigma 54 conformation when bound with core RNA polymerase. Footprints indicate sigma 54 is at the leading edge of DNA-bound holoenzyme. Like the holoenzyme, sigma 54-binding to promoter DNA does not result in DNA strand separation. Instead the specific DNA-binding activity of sigma 54 assists assembly of a closed promoter complex. This complex can be isomerized to the open (DNA melted) complex by activator protein, but promoter-bound sigma 54 alone cannot be induced to melt DNA. The pathway leading to productive transcription is similar to that proposed for eukaryotic RNA polymerase II systems.
Activity of the enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase increases intermittently in synchronized cultures of Chinese hamster cells. During G(1) phase (3 hours after mitosis), midway through S phase (7 hours after mitosis) and again in late S phase (10 hours after mitosis), rapid increases in activity were observed and correlated with a net increase in cell size and total protein. The evidence suggests that this is a general phenomenon which affects a whole population of proteins and may be the expression of an endogenous cellular rhythm.
The later stages of the blood coagulation cascade are characterized by the presence of vitamin K-dependent proteins and their involvement in membrane-bound, multi-protein converting complexes with an essential requirement for calcium ions. Specific interactions between zymogens and activating enzymes have not yet been identified. Here we describe a crystallographic study of prothrombin fragment 1 (residues 1-156 of prothrombin) which indicates that vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins have specific association sites that allow them to form hetero-dimers. The calcium-induced formation of a hetero-dimer between fragment 1 and factor X is demonstrated by cross-linking. Such hetero-dimers of vitamin K-dependent proteins could be significant in the coagulation system.
Proteasomes, the primary mediators of ubiquitin-protein conjugate degradation, are regulated through complex and poorly understood mechanisms. Here we show that USP14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme, can inhibit the degradation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates both in vitro and in cells. A catalytically inactive variant of USP14 has reduced inhibitory activity, indicating that inhibition is mediated by trimming of the ubiquitin chain on the substrate. A high-throughput screen identified a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinating activity of human USP14. Treatment of cultured cells with this compound enhanced degradation of several proteasome substrates that have been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. USP14 inhibition accelerated the degradation of oxidized proteins and enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. Enhancement of proteasome activity through inhibition of USP14 may offer a strategy to reduce the levels of aberrant proteins in cells under proteotoxic stress.
Candida albicans, the most prevalent fungal pathogen in humans, is thought to lack a sexual cycle. A set of C. albicans genes has been identified that corresponds to the master sexual cycle regulators a1, alpha1, and alpha2 of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating-type (MAT) locus. The C. albicans genes are arranged in a way that suggests that these genes are part of a mating type-like locus that is similar to the mating-type loci of other fungi. In addition to the transcriptional regulators a1, alpha1, and alpha2, the C. albicans mating type-like locus contains several genes not seen in other fungal MAT loci, including those encoding proteins similar to poly(A) polymerases, oxysterol binding proteins, and phosphatidylinositol kinases.
The site of plasminogen activator release by differentiated neuroblastoma clonal cell lines was determined with a fibrin overlay assay. Release of plasminogen activator was seen at the growth cone in 72 percent of the cells bearing neurites. For 21 percent of these cells the growth cone was the predominant or exclusive site of this enzyme activity. Selective release of protease at the "trailblazing" tip of the neurite may be important in neuron migration and neurite growth in vivo.
RNase P is the only endonuclease responsible for processing the 5' end of transfer RNA by cleaving a precursor and leading to tRNA maturation. It contains an RNA component and a protein component and has been identified in all organisms. It was one of the first catalytic RNAs identified and the first that acts as a multiple-turnover enzyme in vivo. RNase P and the ribosome are so far the only two ribozymes known to be conserved in all kingdoms of life. The RNA component of bacterial RNase P can catalyse pre-tRNA cleavage in the absence of the RNase P protein in vitro and consists of two domains: a specificity domain and a catalytic domain. Here we report a 3.15-A resolution crystal structure of the 154-nucleotide specificity domain of Bacillus subtilis RNase P. The structure reveals the architecture of this domain, the interactions that maintain the overall fold of the molecule, a large non-helical but well-structured module that is conserved in all RNase P RNA, and the regions that are involved in interactions with the substrate.
RNA interference pathways use small RNAs to mediate gene silencing in eukaryotes. In addition to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs, several types of endogenously produced small RNAs have important roles in gene regulation, germ cell maintenance and transposon silencing. The production of some of these RNAs requires the synthesis of aberrant RNAs (aRNAs) or pre-siRNAs, which are specifically recognized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to make double-stranded RNA. The mechanism for aRNA synthesis and recognition is largely unknown. Here we show that DNA damage induces the expression of the Argonaute protein QDE-2 and a new class of small RNAs in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. This class of small RNAs, known as qiRNAs because of their interaction with QDE-2, are about 20-21 nucleotides long (several nucleotides shorter than Neurospora siRNAs), with a strong preference for uridine at the 5' end, and originate mostly from the ribosomal DNA locus. The production of qiRNAs requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase QDE-1, the Werner and Bloom RecQ DNA helicase homologue QDE-3 and dicers. qiRNA biogenesis also requires DNA-damage-induced aRNAs as precursors, a process that is dependent on both QDE-1 and QDE-3. Notably, our results suggest that QDE-1 is the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that produces aRNAs. Furthermore, the Neurospora RNA interference mutants show increased sensitivity to DNA damage, suggesting a role for qiRNAs in the DNA-damage response by inhibiting protein translation.
Pseudoknot formation folds the 3' ends of many plant viral genomic RNAs into structures that resemble transfer RNA in global folding and in their reactivity to transfer RNA-specific proteins. The solution structure of the pseudoknotted T arm and acceptor arm of the transfer RNA-like structure of turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The molecule is stabilized by the hairpin formed by the 5' end of the RNA, and by the intricate interactions related to the loops of the pseudoknot. Loop 1 spans the major groove of the helix with only two of its four nucleotides. Loop 2, which crosses the minor groove, interacts closely with its opposing helix, in particular through hydrogen bonds with a highly conserved adenine. The structure resulting from this interaction between the minor groove and single-stranded RNA at helical junctions displays internal mobility, which may be a general feature of RNA pseudoknots that regulates their interaction with proteins or other RNA molecules.
Metalloproteins catalyse some of the most complex and important processes in nature, such as photosynthesis and water oxidation. An ultimate test of our knowledge of how metalloproteins work is to design new metalloproteins. Doing so not only can reveal hidden structural features that may be missing from studies of native metalloproteins and their variants, but also can result in new metalloenzymes for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications. Although it is much more challenging to design metalloproteins than non-metalloproteins, much progress has been made in this area, particularly in functional design, owing to recent advances in areas such as computational and structural biology.
Actively transcribing eukaryotic RNA polymerase II is highly phosphorylated on its repetitive carboxyl-terminal domain. We have isolated a protein kinase that phosphorylates serine residues in this repetitive domain. A component of this kinase is cdc2, the product of a cell-cycle control gene previously shown to be a component of M-phase-promoting factor and M-phase-specific histone H1 kinase. This observation suggests a role for the cdc2 protein kinase in transcriptional regulation.
The proteolytic enzyme renin (EC3.4.99.19) cleaves the protein substrate angiotensinogen to yield angiotensin I, the decapeptide substrate transformed by converting enzyme into the pressor substance angiotensin II. Although the contribution of this pathway to the maintenance of normal blood pressure is unclear, it seems to be a major factor in various hypertensive states. Important progress in the control of hypertension has been achieved by development of the potent inhibitors SQ-14,225 (captopril) and MK-421 (enalapril maleate), which block the generation of angiotensin II by the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme. An attractive alternative to the inhibition of converting enzyme would be the blockade of the preceding step in the cascade, the renin reaction. We report here new highly potent (IC50 = 10(-9)-10(-8) M) competitive inhibitors of renin in which statine, (3S,4S)-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid, is incorporated into analogues of the pig renin substrate (Fig. 1).
Localization of beta-actin messenger RNA to sites of active actin polymerization modulates cell migration during embryogenesis, differentiation and possibly carcinogenesis. This localization requires the oncofetal protein ZBP1 (Zipcode binding protein 1), which binds to a conserved 54-nucleotide element in the 3'-untranslated region of the beta-actin mRNA known as the 'zipcode'. ZBP1 promotes translocation of the beta-actin transcript to actin-rich protrusions in primary fibroblasts and neurons. It is not known how the ZBP1-RNA complex achieves asymmetric protein sorting by localizing beta-actin mRNA. Here we show that chicken ZBP1 modulates the translation of beta-actin mRNA. ZBP1 associates with the beta-actin transcript in the nucleus and prevents premature translation in the cytoplasm by blocking translation initiation. Translation only occurs when the ZBP1-RNA complex reaches its destination at the periphery of the cell. At the endpoint of mRNA transport, the protein kinase Src promotes translation by phosphorylating a key tyrosine residue in ZBP1 that is required for binding to RNA. These sequential events provide both temporal and spatial control over beta-actin mRNA translation, which is important for cell migration and neurite outgrowth.
TBP (TATA-binding protein)-associated factors (TAF(II)s) are components of large multiprotein complexes such as TFIID, TFTC, STAGA, PCAF/GCN5, and SAGA, which play a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II. The structures of TFIID and TFTC have been determined at 3.5-nanometer resolution by electron microscopy and digital image analysis of single particles. Human TFIID resembles a macromolecular clamp that contains four globular domains organized around a solvent-accessible groove of a size suitable to bind DNA. TFTC is larger and contains five domains, four of which are similar to TFIID.
Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), a polymer of hundreds of phosphate (Pi) residues, accumulates in Escherichia coli in response to stresses, including amino acid starvation. Here we show that the adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent protease Lon formed a complex with polyP and degraded most of the ribosomal proteins, including S2, L9, and L13. Purified S2 also bound to polyP and formed a complex with Lon in the presence of polyP. Thus, polyP may promote ribosomal protein degradation by the Lon protease, thereby supplying the amino acids needed to respond to starvation.
The nuclear protein encoded by the proto-oncogene c-myb has been hypothesized to play an important role in the process of hematopoiesis, but direct proof of this function has been lacking. To address this issue, normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells were exposed to c-myb sense and antisense synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, and the effects on hematopoietic colony formation and maturation were examined. Exposure of these cells to c-myb antisense, oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in a decrease in both colony size and number, without apparent effect on the maturation of residual colony cells. Exposure to c-myb sense, or irrelevant antisense, oligonucleotides had no such effect. These results show that (i) c-myb plays a critical role in regulating normal human hematopoiesis and (ii) the combined use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and hematopoietic cell culture techniques will provide a powerful tool for studying the role of proteins encoded by proto-oncogenes, or other specific genes, in normal human hematopoiesis.
Experiments correlating template topology with transcriptional activity suggest that DNA topology plays a role in eukaryotic gene expression. Linear templates transfected into cultured cells produce far fewer transcripts than do circular transcription templates, and no transcripts can be detected from linear templates injected into Xenopus oocytes. Further, when transcriptionally active circular templates in Xenopus oocytes are linearized by injection of a restriction enzyme, transcription dramatically decreases. Here we show that transcription by phage T7 RNA polymerase from a divergent promoter can partially replace the requirement for circular Xenopus ribosomal RNA transcription templates in Xenopus oocytes. Supercoiled domains can apparently be generated on short pieces of DNA having no known sequences that result in association with the nuclear architecture, suggesting that localized, transient domains of supercoiling fulfil the minimum topological needs for Xenopus rRNA transcription in vivo.
A sex-linked familial neurological disease consisting of cerebral palsy, mental retardation, choreoathetosis, and compulsive aggressive behavior is associated with a loss of an enzyme that participates in purine metabolism, namely, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The production of excessive uric acid in this disorder implies that the enzyme is involved in the normal regulation of purine biosynthesis. This is the first example of a relation between a specific enzyme defect and abnormal compulsive behavior. It is also the first enzyme defect in purine metabolism demonstrated in a neurological disease.
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare and fatal human premature ageing disease, characterized by premature arteriosclerosis and degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). HGPS is caused by a single point mutation in the lamin A (LMNA) gene, resulting in the generation of progerin, a truncated splicing mutant of lamin A. Accumulation of progerin leads to various ageing-associated nuclear defects including disorganization of nuclear lamina and loss of heterochromatin. Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts obtained from patients with HGPS. HGPS-iPSCs show absence of progerin, and more importantly, lack the nuclear envelope and epigenetic alterations normally associated with premature ageing. Upon differentiation of HGPS-iPSCs, progerin and its ageing-associated phenotypic consequences are restored. Specifically, directed differentiation of HGPS-iPSCs to SMCs leads to the appearance of premature senescence phenotypes associated with vascular ageing. Additionally, our studies identify DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNAPKcs, also known as PRKDC) as a downstream target of progerin. The absence of nuclear DNAPK holoenzyme correlates with premature as well as physiological ageing. Because progerin also accumulates during physiological ageing, our results provide an in vitro iPSC-based model to study the pathogenesis of human premature and physiological vascular ageing.
Introns are removed from nuclear messenger RNA precursors through two sequential phospho-transesterification reactions in a dynamic RNA-protein complex called the spliceosome. But whether splicing is catalysed by small nuclear RNAs in the spliceosome is unresolved. As the spliceosome is a metalloenzyme, it is important to determine whether snRNAs coordinate catalytic metals. Here we show that yeast U6 snRNA coordinates a metal ion that is required for the catalytic activity of the spliceosome. With Mg2+, U6 snRNA with a sulphur substitution for the pro-Rp or pro-Sp non-bridging phosphoryl oxygen of nucleotide U80 reconstitutes a fully assembled yet catalytically inactive spliceosome. Adding a thiophilic ion such as Mn2+ allows the first transesterification reaction to occur in the U6/sU80(Sp)- but not the U6/sU80(Rp)-reconstituted spliceosome. Mg2+ competitively inhibits the Mn2+-rescued reaction, indicating that the metal-binding site at U6/U80 exists in the wild-type spliceosome and that the site changes its metal requirement for activity in the Sp spliceosome. Thus, U6 snRNA contributes to pre-messenger RNA splicing through metal-ion coordination, which is consistent with RNA catalysis by the spliceosome.
A small group of closely related proteins is responsible for all active transport in animal cells, and inorganic cations are the only substances transported by these enzymes. They share a common kinetic mechanism in which two fundamental conformations participate, each receiving and dispatching substrates from its unique side of the membrane. During transport, the cations must pass through their enzyme to cross the membrane and intense interest is currently focused on the possibility that the path which they follow lies within the interface between two discrete subunits in a dimeric structure. Although 'half-of-sites' behaviour, consistent with this hypothesis, has been reported, it is now known that systematic errors were responsible for this mistaken conclusion. The number of protomers which comprise a functional unit of active transport has not been determined.
Autophagy is a process for the bulk degradation of proteins, in which cytoplasmic components of the cell are enclosed by double-membrane structures known as autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes or vacuoles for degradation. This process is crucial for survival during starvation and cell differentiation. No molecules have been identified that are involved in autophagy in higher eukaryotes. We have isolated 14 autophagy-defective (apg) mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and examined the autophagic process at the molecular level. We show here that a unique covalent-modification system is essential for autophagy to occur. The carboxy-terminal glycine residue of Apg12, a 186-amino-acid protein, is conjugated to a lysine at residue 149 of Apg5, a 294-amino-acid protein. Of the apg mutants, we found that apg7 and apg10 were unable to form an Apg5/Apg12 conjugate. By cloning APG7, we discovered that Apg7 is a ubiquitin-E1-like enzyme. This conjugation can be reconstituted in vitro and depends on ATP. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a protein unrelated to ubiquitin that uses a ubiquitination-like conjugation system. Furthermore, Apg5 and Apg12 have mammalian homologues, suggesting that this new modification system is conserved from yeast to mammalian cells.
The antifungal defense of Drosophila is controlled by the spaetzle/Toll/cactus gene cassette. Here, a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding a blood serine protease inhibitor, Spn43Ac, was shown to lead to constitutive expression of the antifungal peptide drosomycin, and this effect was mediated by the spaetzle and Toll gene products. Spaetzle was cleaved by proteolytic enzymes to its active ligand form shortly after immune challenge, and cleaved Spaetzle was constitutively present in Spn43Ac-deficient flies. Hence, Spn43Ac negatively regulates the Toll signaling pathway, and Toll does not function as a pattern recognition receptor in the Drosophila host defense.
The human Dubin-Johnson syndrome and its animal model, the TR(-) rat, are characterized by a chronic conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. TR(-) rats are defective in the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT), which mediates hepatobiliary excretion of numerous organic anions. The complementary DNA for rat cmoat, a homolog of the human multidrug resistance gene (hMRP1), was isolated and shown to be expressed in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. In the TR(-) rat, a single-nucleotide deletion in this gene resulted in a reduced messenger RNA level and absence of the protein. It is likely that this mutation accounts for the TR(-) phenotype.
The electrophoretic mobility of hexokinase from human erythrocytes and other tissues was studied with a new method that depends on the fluorescence of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate for detecting enzyme activity on starch gel. The hexokinase of cord-blood erythrocytes has slightly different electrophoretic properties from that of adult red cells. Type I enzyme is split into type I(A) and type I(F); the latter is more intense in cord blood; in hemolyzates of adult blood, the activity of the two bands is usually about equal. No type II enzyme was found in cord blood. The double type I band was present in red cells from adult rabbits.
During transcription, RNA polymerase (RNAP) moves processively along a DNA template, creating a complementary RNA. Here we present the development of an ultra-stable optical trapping system with angstrom-level resolution, which we used to monitor transcriptional elongation by single molecules of Escherichia coli RNAP. Records showed discrete steps averaging 3.7 +/- 0.6 A, a distance equivalent to the mean rise per base found in B-DNA. By combining our results with quantitative gel analysis, we conclude that RNAP advances along DNA by a single base pair per nucleotide addition to the nascent RNA. We also determined the force-velocity relationship for transcription at both saturating and sub-saturating nucleotide concentrations; fits to these data returned a characteristic distance parameter equivalent to one base pair. Global fits were inconsistent with a model for movement incorporating a power stroke tightly coupled to pyrophosphate release, but consistent with a brownian ratchet model incorporating a secondary NTP binding site.
Kinesin, a mechanoenzyme that couples ATP hydrolysis to movement along microtubules, is thought to power vesicle transport and other forms of microtubule-based motility. Here, microscopic silica beads were precoated with carrier protein, exposed to low concentrations of kinesin, and individually manipulated with a single-beam gradient-force optical particle trap ('optical tweezers') directly onto microtubules. Optical tweezers greatly improved the efficiency of the bead assay, particularly at the lowest kinesin concentrations (corresponding to approximately 1 molecule per bead). Beads incubated with excess kinesin moved smoothly along a microtubule for many micrometres, but beads carrying from 0.17-3 kinesin molecules per bead, moved, on average, only about 1.4 microns and then spontaneously released from the microtubule. Application of the optical trap directly behind such moving beads often pulled them off the microtubule and back into the centre of the trap. This did not occur when a bead was bound by an AMP.PNP-induced rigor linkage, or when beads were propelled by several kinesin molecules. Our results are consistent with a model in which kinesin detaches briefly from the microtubule during a part of each mechanochemical cycle, rather than a model in which kinesin remains bound at all times.
Protein kinase C is important in the transduction of signals generated at the plasma membrane. The physiological activators of protein kinase C are diacylglycerols, and the tumour-promoting phorbol esters, such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-14 acetate (TPA), constitute another group of specific activators. Many cellular substrates for phosphorylation by protein kinase C have been described, but proteins that directly control transcription in response to protein kinase C activation are yet to be identified. TPA treatment leads to induction of various proto-oncogenes, growth factor genes, and genes encoding secreted proteases. In addition. TPA increases the activity of viral enhancer elements. To identify trans-acting factors that mediate the transcriptional response to TPA we chose the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer as a model, because it is known to be composed of several discrete cis-acting elements which are recognized by multiple transacting factors. We report here that the SV40 enhancer contains at least four different TPA responsive elements whose activity is dependent on cell-type. The induction response is likely to involve at least two distinct post-translational steps which modulate the activity of the proteins that recognize these elements.
A copper-nitrosyl intermediate forms during the catalytic cycle of nitrite reductase, the enzyme that mediates the committed step in bacterial denitrification. The crystal structure of a type 2 copper-nitrosyl complex of nitrite reductase reveals an unprecedented side-on binding mode in which the nitrogen and oxygen atoms are nearly equidistant from the copper cofactor. Comparison of this structure with a refined nitrite-bound crystal structure explains how coordination can change between copper-oxygen and copper-nitrogen during catalysis. The side-on copper-nitrosyl in nitrite reductase expands the possibilities for nitric oxide interactions in copper proteins such as superoxide dismutase and prions.
Cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin exert their cytotoxic effect by inducing DNA damage and activating programmed cell death (apoptosis). The tumour-suppressor protein p53 is an important activator of apoptosis. Although p53-deficient cancer cells are less responsive to chemotherapy, their resistance is not complete, which suggests that other apoptotic pathways may exist. A p53-related gene, p73, which encodes several proteins as a result of alternative splicing, can also induce apoptosis. Here we show that the amount of p73 protein in the cell is increased by cisplatin. This induction of p73 is not seen in cells unable to carry out mismatch repair and in which the nuclear enzyme c-Abl tyrosine kinase is not activated by cisplatin. The half-life of p73 is prolonged by cisplatin and by co-expression with c-Abl tyrosine kinase; the apoptosis-inducing function of p73 is also enhanced by the c-Abl kinase. Mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in mismatch repair or in c-Abl do not upregulate p73 and are more resistant to killing by cisplatin. Our results indicate that c-Abl and p73 are components of a mismatch-repair-dependent apoptosis pathway which contributes to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.
Ribonucleotide reductase is the only enzyme that catalyses de novo formation of deoxyribonucleotides and is thus a key enzyme in DNA synthesis. The radical-based reaction involves five cysteins. Two redox-active cysteines are located at adjacent antiparallel strands in a new type of ten-stranded alpha/beta-barrel, and two others at the carboxyl end in a flexible arm. The fifth cysteine, in a loop in the centre of the barrel, is positioned to initiate the radical reaction.
The ras proto-oncogene, found in all eukaryotes so far examined, encode s a protein with guanine nucleotide-binding and GTPase activity. Gene disruption experiments in yeast indicate that ras is essential for cell growth. Anit-sense mutagenesis approaches suggest that this is also true for Dictyostelium. Most mutations causing an amino-acid substitution for Gly 12 result in decreased GTPase activity and produce a transforming phenotype. In yeast, a Gly 19---- Val 19, missense mutation (Gly 19 is similar to Gly 12 in mammalian and Dictyostelium ras proteins) causes a series of dominant phenotypes, including elevated adenylate cyclase activity. In mammalian cells there is no evidence that ras activates adenylate cyclase activity. D. discoideum contains a single ras gene (Dd-ras) that encodes a protein very similar to the mammalian ras protein and identical to c-ras at the potentially transforming positions. Dd-ras is expressed in vegetative cells and later in development in prestalk cells whereas ras protein is found in vegetative and developing cells. In the migrating pseudoplasmodium, ras protein is found in prestalk but not prespore cells, suggesting it is involved in the function and/or differentiation of the anteriorly localized prestalk cells. In this report we examine the effects of expression of a Dd-ras gene carrying a Gly-12----Thr 12 missense mutation.
Ste5 is a scaffold for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade components in a yeast pheromone response pathway. Ste5 also associates with Ste4, the beta subunit of a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein, potentially linking receptor activation to stimulation of the MAPK cascade. A RING-H2 motif at the Ste5 amino terminus is apparently essential for function because Ste5(C177S) and Ste5(C177A C180A) mutants did not rescue the mating defect of a ste5Delta cell. In vitro Ste5(C177A C180A) bound each component of the MAPK cascade, but not Ste4. Unlike wild-type Ste5, the mutant did not appear to oligomerize; however, when fused to a heterologous dimerization domain (glutathione S-transferase), the chimeric protein restored mating in an ste5Delta cell and an ste4Delta ste5Delta double mutant. Thus, the RING-H2 domain mediates Ste4-Ste5 interaction, which is a prerequisite for Ste5-Ste5 self-association and signaling.
Hyperlipidemia, one of the most important risk factors for coronary heart disease, is often associated with inflammation. We identified lymphotoxin (LT) and LIGHT, tumor necrosis factor cytokine family members that are primarily expressed on lymphocytes, as critical regulators of key enzymes that control lipid metabolism. Dysregulation of LIGHT expression on T cells resulted in hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. In low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice, which lack the ability to control lipid levels in the blood, inhibition of LT and LIGHT signaling with a soluble lymphotoxin beta receptor decoy protein attenuated the dyslipidemia. These results suggest that the immune system directly influences lipid metabolism and that LT modulating agents may represent a novel therapeutic route for the treatment of dyslipidemia.
The serine proteinase alpha-thrombin causes blood clotting through proteolytic cleavage of fibrinogen and protease-activated receptors and amplifies its own generation by activating the essential clotting factors V and VIII. Thrombomodulin, a transmembrane thrombin receptor with six contiguous epidermal growth factor-like domains (TME1-6), profoundly alters the substrate specificity of thrombin from pro- to anticoagulant by activating protein C. Activated protein C then deactivates the coagulation cascade by degrading activated factors V and VIII. The thrombin-thrombomodulin complex inhibits fibrinolysis by activating the procarboxypeptidase thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor. Here we present the 2.3 A crystal structure of human alpha-thrombin bound to the smallest thrombomodulin fragment required for full protein-C co-factor activity, TME456. The Y-shaped thrombomodulin fragment binds to thrombin's anion-binding exosite-I, preventing binding of procoagulant substrates. Thrombomodulin binding does not seem to induce marked allosteric structural rearrangements at the thrombin active site. Rather, docking of a protein C model to thrombin-TME456 indicates that TME45 may bind substrates in such a manner that their zymogen-activation cleavage sites are presented optimally to the unaltered thrombin active site.
The crystal structure of the haematopoietic cell kinase Hck has been determined at 2.6/2.9 A resolution. Inhibition of enzymatic activity is a consequence of intramolecular interactions of the enzyme's Src-homology domains SH2 and SH3, with concomitant displacement of elements of the catalytic domain. The conformation of the active site has similarities with that of inactive cyclin-dependent protein kinases.
The oligonucleotides pppA2'p5'A2'p5'A and related oligomers (2-5A) are synthesized by an enzyme that is widely distributed in a variety of cells, the activity of which varies with interferon treatment, growth and hormone status. Because significant amounts of 2-5A have recently been detected in interferon-treated cells, it has been suggested that the oligonucleotides may be involved in interferon action and in the control of cell metabolism. In both intact cells and cell-free systems 2-5A has been shown to activate a ribonuclease. We report here investigations of the sequence specificities of the 2-5A-dependent ribonucleases in extracts of rabbit reticulocytes, mouse ascites tumour cells and human lymphoblastoid cells in conditions of partial digestion using terminally labelled RNA substrates. The enzymes cleaved on the 3'-side of UN sequences to yield UpNp terminated products. Cleavage was observed predominantly at UA and UU sequences.
During neural development, coordinate regulation of cell-cycle exit and differentiation is essential for cell-fate specification, cell survival, and proper wiring of neuronal circuits. However, the molecules that direct these events remain poorly defined. In the developing spinal cord, the differentiation of motor neuron progenitors into postmitotic motor neurons is regulated by retinoid signaling. Here, we identify a retinoid-inducible gene, GDE2 (glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2), encoding a six-transmembrane protein that is necessary and sufficient to drive spinal motor neuron differentiation in vivo. A single amino acid mutation in the extracellular catalytic domain abolishes protein function. This reveals a critical role for glycerophosphodiester metabolism in motor neuron differentiation.
Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are multifunctional enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of a huge variety of carbon chains differing in their length and patterns of functionality and cyclization. Many polyketides are valuable therapeutic agents. A Streptomyces host-vector system has been developed for efficient construction and expression of recombinant PKSs. Using this expression system, several novel compounds have been synthesized in vivo in significant quantities. Characterization of these metabolites has provided new insights into key features of actinomycete aromatic PKS specificity. Thus, carbon chain length is dictated, at least in part, by a protein that appears to be distinctive to this family of PKSs, whereas the acyl carrier proteins of different PKSs can be interchanged without affecting product structure. A given ketoreductase can recognize and reduce polyketide chains of different length; this ketoreduction always occurs at the C-9 position. The regiospecificity of the first cyclization of the nascent polyketide chain is either determined by the ketoreductase, or the chain-extending enzymes themselves. However, the regiospecificity of the second cyclization is determined by a distinct cyclase, which can discriminate between substrates of different chain lengths.
The bacterial AlkB protein is known to be involved in cellular recovery from alkylation damage; however, the function of this protein remains unknown. AlkB homologues have been identified in several organisms, including humans, and a recent sequence alignment study has suggested that these proteins may belong to a superfamily of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent and iron-dependent oxygenases (2OG-Fe(ii)-oxygenases). Here we show that AlkB from Escherichia coli is indeed a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent and iron-dependent DNA repair enzyme that releases replication blocks in alkylated DNA by a mechanism involving oxidative demethylation of 1-methyladenine residues. This mechanism represents a new pathway for DNA repair and the third type of DNA damage reversal mechanism so far discovered.
DNA lesions that block replication are a primary cause of rearrangements, mutations, and lethality in all cells. After ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage in Escherichia coli, replication recovery requires RecA and several other recF pathway proteins. To characterize the mechanism by which lesion-blocked replication forks recover, we used two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis to show that replication-blocking DNA lesions induce a transient reversal of the replication fork in vivo. The reversed replication fork intermediate is stabilized by RecA and RecF and is degraded by the RecQ-RecJ helicase-nuclease when these proteins are absent. We propose that fork regression allows repair enzymes to gain access to the replication-blocking lesion, allowing processive replication to resume once the blocking lesion is removed.
Until now the interferon-mediated 2'-5' adenine oligonucleotide inhibitors (2-5A) of cell-free protein synthesis have not been detected in intact cells. Here we report their natural occurrence in interferon-treated, EMC virus-infected mouse L cells in amounts consistent with the idea that they play a part in the inhibition of virus growth.
Riboswitches are cis-acting genetic regulatory elements found in the 5'-untranslated regions of messenger RNAs that control gene expression through their ability to bind small molecule metabolites directly. Regulation occurs through the interplay of two domains of the RNA: an aptamer domain that responds to intracellular metabolite concentrations and an expression platform that uses two mutually exclusive secondary structures to direct a decision-making process. In Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus species, riboswitches control the expression of more than 2% of all genes through their ability to respond to a diverse set of metabolites including amino acids, nucleobases and protein cofactors. Here we report the 2.9-angstroms resolution crystal structure of an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-responsive riboswitch from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis complexed with S-adenosylmethionine, an RNA element that controls the expression of several genes involved in sulphur and methionine metabolism. This RNA folds into a complex three-dimensional architecture that recognizes almost every functional group of the ligand through a combination of direct and indirect readout mechanisms. Ligand binding induces the formation of a series of tertiary interactions with one of the helices, serving as a communication link between the aptamer and expression platform domains.
Many cell-cycle-specific events are supported by stage-specific gene expression. In budding yeast, at least three different nuclear factors seem to cooperate in the periodic activation of G2/M-specific genes. Here we show, by using chromatin immunoprecipitation polymerase chain reaction assays, that a positive regulator, Ndd1, becomes associated with G2/M promoter regions in manner that depends on the stage in cell cycle. Its recruitment depends on a permanent protein-DNA complex consisting of the MADS box protein, Mcm1, and a recently identified partner Fkh2, a forkhead/winged helix related transcription factor. The lethality of Ndd1 depletion is suppressed by fkh2 null mutations, which indicates that Fkh2 may also have a negative regulatory role in the transcription of G2/M-induced RNAs. We conclude that Ndd1-Fkh2 interactions may be the transcriptionally important process targeted by Cdk activity.
Regulatory factor X (RFX) proteins are transcriptional activators that recognize X-boxes (DNA of the sequence 5'-GTNRCC(0-3N)RGYAAC-3', where N is any nucleotide, R is a purine and Y is a pyrimidine) using a highly conserved 76-residue DNA-binding domain (DBD). DNA-binding defects in the protein RFX5 cause bare lymphocyte syndrome or major histocompatibility antigen class II deficiency. RFX1, -2 and -3 regulate expression of other medically important gene products (for example, interleukin-5 receptor alpha chain, IL-5R alpha). Fusions of the ligand-binding domain of the oestrogen receptor with the DBD of RFX4 occur in some human breast tumours. Here we present a 1.5 A-resolution structure of two copies of the DBD of human RFX1 (hRFX1) binding cooperatively to a symmetrical X-box. hRFX1 is an unusual member of the winged-helix subfamily of helix-turn-helix proteins because it uses a beta-hairpin (or wing) to recognize DNA instead of the recognition helix typical of helix-turn-helix proteins. A new model for interactions between linker histones and DNA is proposed.
A novel approach to engineering enzyme specificity is presented in which a catalytic group from an enzyme is first removed by site-directed mutagenesis causing inactivation. Activity is then partially restored by substrates containing the missing catalytic functional group. Replacement of the catalytic His with Ala in the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin gene (the mutant is designated His64Ala) by site-directed mutagenesis reduces the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by a factor of a million when assayed with N-succinyl-L-Phe-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide (sFAAF-pNA). Model building studies showed that a His side chain at the P2 position of a substrate bound at the active site of subtilisin could be virtually superimposed on the catalytic His side chain of this serine protease. Accordingly, the His64Ala mutant hydrolyzes a His P2 substrate (sFAHF-pNA) up to 400 times faster than a homologous Ala P2 or Gln P2 substrate (sFAAF-pNA or sFAQF-pNA) at pH 8.0. In contrast, the wild-type enzyme hydrolyzes these three substrates with similar catalytic efficiencies. Additional data from substrate-dependent pH profiles and hydrolysis of large polypeptides indicate that the His64Ala mutant enzyme can recover partially the function of the lost catalytic histidine from a His P2 side chain on the substrate. Such "substrate-assisted catalysis" provides a new basis for engineering enzymes with very narrow and potentially useful substrate specificities. These studies also suggest a possible functional intermediate in the evolution of the catalytic triad of serine proteases.
Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is a common complication of lung and certain other cancers. The hypercalcemia results from the actions of tumor factors on bone and kidney. We report here the isolation of full-length complementary DNA clones of a putative hypercalcemia factor, and the expression from the cloned DNA of the active protein in mammalian cells. The clones encode a prepro peptide of 36 amino acids and a mature protein of 141 amino acids that has significant homology with parathyroid hormone in the amino-terminal region. This previously unrecognized hormone may be important in normal as well as abnormal calcium metabolism.
Renin, an aspartate protease, cleaves the alpha-globulin angiotensinogen to produce the decapeptide angiotensin I, which is then converted to the vasoactive hormone angiotensin II by the action of a peptidase 'converting enzyme'. An inactive form of renin sometimes termed prorenin is present in normal human plasma. Its enzymatic activity is increased by exposure to a pH of 3.0 or 3.3 followed by dialysis towards neutral pH. Only a small proportion of the inactive renin is activated during the acid stage of dialysis, most of the activation apparently taking place during the subsequent dialysis to pH 5.7 (ref. 4) or 7.5 (ref. 5). Furthermore, if inhibitors of serine proteases are added to the plasma, the amount of inactive renin activated by this dialysis procedure is reduced. These results suggest that acid-activation is mediated by serine proteases. The role of enzymes such as plasma kallikrein, plasmin and renal kallikrein as physiological activators of inactive renin has recently been discussed. In our study of the activation of plasma inactive renin we have no found that, contrary to previous reports, complete activation of inactive renin takes place during the acid stage of dialysis. This activation can be reversed if plasma is rapidly adjusted to pH 7.4 and warmed. The next step in the acid-activation procedure, that is, dialysis to neutral pH, renders the initial acid-activation irreversible. These results were completely unexpected, and we offer an explanation that reassesses the nature of inactive renin and the activation process.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae was examined for tyrosine kinase activity in vitro because this organism offers molecular and genetic approaches for analyzing the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in cellular growth control that are unavailable in higher eukaryotes. Yeast extracts phosphorylated a random copolymer (glutamic acid:tyrosine, 80:20) at tyrosine in a reaction that was linear with respect to time and protein concentration. In the absence of added copolymer, phosphotyrosine was 0.1 percent of the total phosphoamino acids labeled with [gamma-32P]adenosine triphosphate in endogenous yeast proteins. However, specific activities of these reactions were low (approximately 1 percent of those in extracts of chick embryo fibroblasts). Lack of significant incorporation of label from [alpha-32P]adenosine triphosphate into the copolymer or endogenous yeast proteins demonstrated that nucleotide interconversion, adenylylation, and subsequent hydrolysis could not account for the generation of phosphotyrosine observed.
Ribonuclease H digests the RNA strand of duplex RNA.DNA hybrids into oligonucleotides. This activity is indispensable for retroviral infection and is involved in bacterial replication. The ribonuclease H from Escherichia coli is homologous with the retroviral proteins. The crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme reveals a distinctive alpha-beta tertiary fold. Analysis of the molecular model implicates a carboxyl triad in the catalytic mechanism and suggests a likely mode for the binding of RNA.DNA substrates. The structure was determined by the method of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) with the use of synchrotron data from a crystal of the recombinant selenomethionyl protein.
Although extensive data support a central pathogenic role for amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease, the amyloid hypothesis remains controversial, in part because a specific neurotoxic species of Abeta and the nature of its effects on synaptic function have not been defined in vivo. Here we report that natural oligomers of human Abeta are formed soon after generation of the peptide within specific intracellular vesicles and are subsequently secreted from the cell. Cerebral microinjection of cell medium containing these oligomers and abundant Abeta monomers but no amyloid fibrils markedly inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rats in vivo. Immunodepletion from the medium of all Abeta species completely abrogated this effect. Pretreatment of the medium with insulin-degrading enzyme, which degrades Abeta monomers but not oligomers, did not prevent the inhibition of LTP. Therefore, Abeta oligomers, in the absence of monomers and amyloid fibrils, disrupted synaptic plasticity in vivo at concentrations found in human brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, treatment of cells with gamma-secretase inhibitors prevented oligomer formation at doses that allowed appreciable monomer production, and such medium no longer disrupted LTP, indicating that synaptotoxic Abeta oligomers can be targeted therapeutically.
Polypeptides emerging from the ribosome must fold into stable three-dimensional structures and maintain that structure throughout their functional lifetimes. Maintaining quality control over protein structure and function depends on molecular chaperones and proteases, both of which can recognize hydrophobic regions exposed on unfolded polypeptides. Molecular chaperones promote proper protein folding and prevent aggregation, and energy-dependent proteases eliminate irreversibly damaged proteins. The kinetics of partitioning between chaperones and proteases determines whether a protein will be destroyed before it folds properly. When both quality control options fail, damaged proteins accumulate as aggregates, a process associated with amyloid diseases.
The study of metabolic regulation in microorganisms has revealed several simple but efficient regulatory circuits. In one, the operation of an entire sequence of enzymes is controlled by the activity of the initial enzyme which contains a specific inhibitor site. When this site is combined with the endproduct of the sequence, the catalytic site is rendered inactive. In another, the formation of an entire sequence of enzymes is controlled by means of a cytoplasmic mediator which blocks the transcription of the genetic message (repression) when activated by the endproduct, or which allows the transcription (induction) when activated by the substrate of the first enzyme in the sequence. Additional circuits have been proposed for the regulation of RNA and DNA synthesis. The same regulatory devices could account, in part, for intracellular metabolic control in more complex animal and plant forms. However, superimposed upon these simple control circuits will be found others which take advantage of the greater degree of organization in these cells and of the possibilities for regulating gene function that are provided by the chromosomes. The pattern of proteins with special control sites, such as have evolved in the relatively simple controls found in bacteria, may also be found essential for intercellular controls involving nervous and humoral mechanisms.
In all organisms, the protein machinery responsible for the replication of DNA, the replisome, is faced with a directionality problem. The antiparallel nature of duplex DNA permits the leading-strand polymerase to advance in a continuous fashion, but forces the lagging-strand polymerase to synthesize in the opposite direction. By extending RNA primers, the lagging-strand polymerase restarts at short intervals and produces Okazaki fragments. At least in prokaryotic systems, this directionality problem is solved by the formation of a loop in the lagging strand of the replication fork to reorient the lagging-strand DNA polymerase so that it advances in parallel with the leading-strand polymerase. The replication loop grows and shrinks during each cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Here we use single-molecule techniques to visualize, in real time, the formation and release of replication loops by individual replisomes of bacteriophage T7 supporting coordinated DNA replication. Analysis of the distributions of loop sizes and lag times between loops reveals that initiation of primer synthesis and the completion of an Okazaki fragment each serve as a trigger for loop release. The presence of two triggers may represent a fail-safe mechanism ensuring the timely reset of the replisome after the synthesis of every Okazaki fragment.
Harvey murine sarcoma virus is a retrovirus which transforms cells by means of a single virally encoded protein called p21 has. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of 1.0 kilobase in the 5' half of the viral genome which encompasses the has coding sequences and its associated regulatory signals. The nucleotide sequence has identified the amino acid sequence of two additional overlapping polypeptides which share their reading frames and the carboxyl termini with p21 but which contain additional NH2-terminal amino acids.
An approach based on the polymerase chain reaction has been devised to clone new members of the family of genes encoding guanosine triphosphate-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors. Degenerate primers corresponding to consensus sequences of the third and sixth transmembrane segments of available receptors were used to selectively amplify and clone members of this gene family from thyroid complementary DNA. Clones encoding three known receptors and four new putative receptors were obtained. Sequence comparisons established that the new genes belong to the G protein-coupled receptor family. Close structural similarity was observed between one of the putative receptors and the 5HT1a receptor. Two other molecules displayed common sequence characteristics, suggesting that they are members of a new subfamily of receptors with a very short nonglycosylated (extracellular) amino-terminal extension.
In the absence of costimulation, T cells activated through their antigen receptor become unresponsive (anergic) and do not transcribe the gene encoding interleukin-2 (IL-2) when restimulated with antigen. Anergic alloantigen-specific human T cells contained phosphorylated Cbl that coimmunoprecipitated with Fyn. The adapter protein CrkL was associated with both phosphorylated Cbl and the guanidine nucleotide-releasing factor C3G, which catalyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange on Rap1. Active Rap1 (GTP-bound form) was present in anergic cells. Forced expression of low amounts of Rap1-GTP in Jurkat T cells recapitulated the anergic defect and blocked T cell antigen receptor (TCR)- and CD28-mediated IL-2 gene transcription. Therefore, Rap1 functions as a negative regulator of TCR-mediated IL-2 gene transcription and may be responsible for the specific defect in IL-2 production in T cell anergy.
Small RNAs associate with Argonaute proteins and serve as sequence-specific guides to regulate messenger RNA stability, protein synthesis, chromatin organization and genome structure. In animals, Argonaute proteins segregate into two subfamilies. The Argonaute subfamily acts in RNA interference and in microRNA-mediated gene regulation using 21-22-nucleotide RNAs as guides. The Piwi subfamily is involved in germline-specific events such as germline stem cell maintenance and meiosis. However, neither the biochemical function of Piwi proteins nor the nature of their small RNA guides is known. Here we show that MIWI, a murine Piwi protein, binds a previously uncharacterized class of approximately 29-30-nucleotide RNAs that are highly abundant in testes. We have therefore named these Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). piRNAs show distinctive localization patterns in the genome, being predominantly grouped into 20-90-kilobase clusters, wherein long stretches of small RNAs are derived from only one strand. Similar piRNAs are also found in human and rat, with major clusters occurring in syntenic locations. Although their function must still be resolved, the abundance of piRNAs in germline cells and the male sterility of Miwi mutants suggest a role in gametogenesis.
Successful viral infection requires viruses to redirect host biochemistry to replicate the viral genome, and produce and assemble progeny virions. Cellular heat-shock responses, which are characterized as elevation and relocalization of heat-shock proteins, occur during replication of many viruses. Such responses might be host reactions to the synthesis of foreign protein, or might be irrelevant consequences of the viral need to activate transcription. Alternatively, as heat-shock proteins can facilitate protein folding, activating a heat-shock response might be a specific virus function ensuring proper synthesis of viral proteins and virions. It is not possible to determine whether heat-shock response is essential for virus replication, because the implicated viral genes (such as Ad5 EIA, ref. 10) also control other essential replication steps. Here we report that expression of Gam1, a protein encoded by the avian virus CELO (ref. 11), elevates and relocalizes hsp70 and hsp40. Gam1-negative CELO is replication-defective; however, Gam1 function can be partially replaced by either heat shock or forced hsp40 expression. Thus, an essential function of Gam1 during virus replication is to activate host heat-shock responses with hsp40 as a primary target.
Caspases are intracellular proteases that function as initiators and effectors of apoptosis. The kinase Akt and p21-Ras, an Akt activator, induced phosphorylation of pro-caspase-9 (pro-Casp9) in cells. Cytochrome c-induced proteolytic processing of pro-Casp9 was defective in cytosolic extracts from cells expressing either active Ras or Akt. Akt phosphorylated recombinant Casp9 in vitro on serine-196 and inhibited its protease activity. Mutant pro-Casp9(Ser196Ala) was resistant to Akt-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition in vitro and in cells, resulting in Akt-resistant induction of apoptosis. Thus, caspases can be directly regulated by protein phosphorylation.
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is a major health problem, affecting 5% of the world population. Genetic factors are important in NIDDM, but the mechanisms leading to glucose intolerance are unknown. Genetic linkage has been investigated in multigeneration families to localize, and ultimately identify, the gene(s) predisposing to NIDDM. Here we report linkage between the glucokinase locus on chromosome 7p and diabetes in 16 French families with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, a form of NIDDM characterized by monogenic autosomal dominant transmission and early age of onset. Statistical evidence of genetic heterogeneity was significant, with an estimated 45-95% of the 16 families showing linkage to glucokinase. Because glucokinase is a key enzyme of blood glucose homeostasis, these results are evidence that a gene involved in glucose metabolism could be implicated in the pathogenesis of NIDDM.
The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution. In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers approximately 99% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of approximately 1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.
A single gene, src of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) coding for a protein of pp60src, is responsible for the transformation of fibroblasts. DNA sequences homologous to src (the endogenous sarc) are presented in uninfected cells of chickens and other vertebrates. Endogenous nucleotide sequences have also been found in the putative transforming genes of MC29 (ref. 6) and avian erythroblastosis virus. These viruses, however, induce different spectra of tumours in animals. From analysis of a new avian sarcoma virus, Y73, we present here evidence suggesting that multiforms of viral sarcoma genes originated from cellular genetic sequences, and that these viral genes are structurally unrelated, but have similar pathogenicities.
Public health measures have successfully identified and contained outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), but concerns remain over the possibility of future recurrences. Finding a vaccine for this virus therefore remains a high priority. Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induces T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model. Alternative forms of S were analysed by DNA immunization. These expression vectors induced robust immune responses mediated by CD4 and CD8 cells, as well as significant antibody titres, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, antibody responses in mice vaccinated with an expression vector encoding a form of S that includes its transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing antibodies. Viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors, and protection was mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism. Gene-based vaccination for the SARS-CoV elicits effective immune responses that generate protective immunity in an animal model.
LINE-1 (L1) elements are retrotransposons that comprise large fractions of mammalian genomes. Transcription through L1 open reading frames is inefficient owing to an elongation defect, inhibiting the robust expression of L1 RNA and proteins, the substrate and enzyme(s) for retrotransposition. This elongation defect probably controls L1 transposition frequency in mammalian cells. Here we report bypassing this transcriptional defect by synthesizing the open reading frames of L1 from synthetic oligonucleotides, altering 24% of the nucleic acid sequence without changing the amino acid sequence. Such resynthesis led to greatly enhanced steady-state L1 RNA and protein levels. Remarkably, when the synthetic open reading frames were substituted for the wild-type open reading frames in an established retrotransposition assay, transposition levels increased more than 200-fold. This indicates that there are probably no large, rigidly conserved cis-acting nucleic acid sequences required for retrotransposition within L1 coding regions. These synthetic retrotransposons are also the most highly active L1 elements known so far and have potential as practical tools for manipulating mammalian genomes.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nucleotide-long RNA molecules regulating gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. In metazoa, miRNAs act by imperfectly base-pairing with the 3' untranslated region of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repressing protein accumulation by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that endogenous let-7 microribonucleoproteins (miRNPs) or the tethering of Argonaute (Ago) proteins to reporter mRNAs in human cells inhibit translation initiation. M(7)G-cap-independent translation is not subject to repression, suggesting that miRNPs interfere with recognition of the cap. Repressed mRNAs, Ago proteins, and miRNAs were all found to accumulate in processing bodies. We propose that localization of mRNAs to these structures is a consequence of translational repression.
Deoxyribonucleic acid contains sequences complementary to homologous amino-acid transfer ribonucleic acid molecules which serve as the translating device between polyribonucleotides and proteins. This implies that the RNA molecules have their primary origin in DNA. From the amount of DNA participating, one would infer that more than 20 complementary sequences exist per genome, a conclusion consistent with a degenerate code. The fact that complex formation occurs most readily with homologous RNA suggests that, while the language remains universal, each dictionary is uniquely identifiable with its own genome.
Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal of the malarial parasites that infect humans, undergoes three cycles of development in its vertebrate host and elicits stage-specific immune responses. This stage specificity of the immune response has made it difficult to isolate antigens that would be useful in developing a vaccine against malaria. A complementary DNA clone for a glycophorin-binding protein of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites has been isolated and characterized. The protein interacts with glycophorin, the erythrocyte receptor, during invasion of the host cell by the parasite. Antigenic determinants of this protein expressed in Escherichia coli have been used to produce antibodies to a glycophorin-binding protein. The antibodies show schizont-specific immunofluorescence and react with the merozoite protein. The primary sequence of these determinants reveals a 150-nucleotide tandem-repeating sequence coding for a 50-amino-acid repeat. The characterization of the Plasmodium falciparum glycophorin-binding protein represents one approach toward designing serologic agents to block the parasite's development in the vertebrate host.
The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its amino-terminal residue. Overexpression of targeting components of the N-end rule pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibited the growth of haploid but not diploid cells. This ploidy-dependent toxicity was shown to result from enhanced degradation of Gpa1, the alpha subunit (G alpha) of a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) that regulates cell differentiation in response to mating pheromones. Sst2, a protein whose absence renders cells hypersensitive to pheromone, was essential for degradation of G alpha but not other N-end rule substrates, suggesting the involvement of an indirect, or trans-, targeting mechanism. G alpha degradation by the N-end rule pathway adds another regulatory dimension to the multitude of signaling functions mediated by G proteins.
Accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Formation of amyloid-beta is catalysed by gamma-secretase, a protease with numerous substrates. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that confer substrate specificity on this potentially promiscuous enzyme. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying its selectivity is critical for the development of clinically effective gamma-secretase inhibitors that can reduce amyloid-beta formation without impairing cleavage of other gamma-secretase substrates, especially Notch, which is essential for normal biological functions. Here we report the discovery of a novel gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP) that drastically and selectively increases amyloid-beta production through a mechanism involving its interactions with both gamma-secretase and its substrate, the amyloid precursor protein carboxy-terminal fragment (APP-CTF). GSAP does not interact with Notch, nor does it affect its cleavage. Recombinant GSAP stimulates amyloid-beta production in vitro. Reducing GSAP concentrations in cell lines decreases amyloid-beta concentrations. Knockdown of GSAP in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease reduces levels of amyloid-beta and plaque development. GSAP represents a type of gamma-secretase regulator that directs enzyme specificity by interacting with a specific substrate. We demonstrate that imatinib, an anticancer drug previously found to inhibit amyloid-beta formation without affecting Notch cleavage, achieves its amyloid-beta-lowering effect by preventing GSAP interaction with the gamma-secretase substrate, APP-CTF. Thus, GSAP can serve as an amyloid-beta-lowering therapeutic target without affecting other key functions of gamma-secretase.
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common form of adult kidney cancer, characterized by the presence of inactivating mutations in the VHL gene in most cases, and by infrequent somatic mutations in known cancer genes. To determine further the genetics of ccRCC, we have sequenced 101 cases through 3,544 protein-coding genes. Here we report the identification of inactivating mutations in two genes encoding enzymes involved in histone modification-SETD2, a histone H3 lysine 36 methyltransferase, and JARID1C (also known as KDM5C), a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase-as well as mutations in the histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase, UTX (KMD6A), that we recently reported. The results highlight the role of mutations in components of the chromatin modification machinery in human cancer. Furthermore, NF2 mutations were found in non-VHL mutated ccRCC, and several other probable cancer genes were identified. These results indicate that substantial genetic heterogeneity exists in a cancer type dominated by mutations in a single gene, and that systematic screens will be key to fully determining the somatic genetic architecture of cancer.
Nerve growth factor (NGF) is thought to have a profound effect on the development and maintenance of sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurones (see refs 1-3 for review). NGF activity isolated from the male mouse submaxillary gland (MSG) consists of three types of subunits, alpha, beta and gamma, which specifically interact to form a 7S, approximately 130,000-molecular weight (Mr) complex. The 7S complex contains two identical 118-amino acid beta-chains, which are solely responsible for the nerve growth-stimulating activity of NGF. While NGF is found in almost all vertebrates, most research has focused on murine NGF, as the mouse male submaxillary gland contains higher levels of this polypeptide than other tissues. Even so, beta-NGF comprises only approximately 0.1% of the protein in this small gland, which has made the study of this polypeptide difficult. The amino acid sequence of the mouse NGF beta-chain has been determined and some information has been obtained regarding the size of a mouse precursor molecule, pro-beta-NGF, but little was known about the structure and relatedness of beta-NGF from other vertebrates. Here we describe the isolation of mouse beta-NGF complementary DNA (cDNA) and present its nucleotide sequence, which predicts a prepro-beta-NGF molecule of Mr 27,000 (27K) and a pro-beta-NGF molecule of Mr 25K. We have used the mouse beta-NGF cDNA clone to isolate the human beta-NGF gene, the coding regions of which are highly homologous to the mouse prepro-beta-NGF nucleotide and amino acid sequences.
Transfer RNA nucleotidyltransferases (CCA-adding enzymes) are responsible for the maturation or repair of the functional 3' end of tRNAs by means of the addition of the essential nucleotides CCA. However, it is unclear how tRNA nucleotidyltransferases polymerize CCA onto the 3' terminus of immature tRNAs without using a nucleic acid template. Here we describe the crystal structure of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus tRNA nucleotidyltransferase in complex with tRNA. We also present ternary complexes of this enzyme with both RNA duplex mimics of the tRNA acceptor stem that terminate with the nucleotides C74 or C75, as well as the appropriate incoming nucleoside 5'-triphosphates. A single nucleotide-binding pocket exists whose specificity for both CTP and ATP is determined by the protein side chain of Arg 224 and backbone phosphates of the tRNA, which are non-complementary to and thus exclude UTP and GTP. Discrimination between CTP or ATP at a given addition step and at termination arises from changes in the size and shape of the nucleotide binding site that is progressively altered by the elongating 3' end of the tRNA.
The activities of cyclic nucleotide phosphohydrolase, an enzyme marker for oligodendrocytes, and glutamine synthetase, an enzyme marker for astrocytes, were studied at early (21 to 26) and late (82 to 88) cell passages. The activity of cyclic nucleotide phosphohydrolase was markedly high and that of glutamine synthetase was low in the early passages, but this relation was reversed in the late passages. These findings suggest a "transdifferentiation" of C6 glial cells with passage in culture.
Endurance exercise training promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle and enhances muscle oxidative capacity, but the signaling mechanisms involved are poorly understood. To investigate this adaptive process, we generated transgenic mice that selectively express in skeletal muscle a constitutively active form of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV*). Skeletal muscles from these mice showed augmented mitochondrial DNA replication and mitochondrial biogenesis, up-regulation of mitochondrial enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and electron transport, and reduced susceptibility to fatigue during repetitive contractions. CaMK induced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in vivo, and activated the PGC-1 gene promoter in cultured myocytes. Thus, a calcium-regulated signaling pathway controls mitochondrial biogenesis in mammalian cells.
The Ras-related Rho subfamily of GTP-binding proteins (p21s), which includes Rho, Rac and Cdc42Hs, is implicated in different aspects of cytoskeletal organization. These proteins behave like Ras (p21ras) in that their active GTP-bound form is inactivated by intrinsic hydrolysis of the nucleotide gamma-phosphate, which can be stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). We have previously shown that there is a diversity of GAPs that recognize this subfamily, including n-chimaerin, which is enriched in the hippocampus; we also detected proteins that bind these p21 proteins and seem to inhibit GTP hydrolysis. We now report the characterization of a hippocampal complementary DNA encoding a tyrosine kinase that specifically binds Cdc42Hs in its GTP-bound form. This binding is mediated by a unique sequence of 47 amino acids C-terminal to an SH3 domain and inhibits both the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of Cdc42Hs. Our findings indicate that there may be a regulatory mechanism that sustains the GTP-bound active form of Cdc42Hs and which is directly linked to a tyrosine phosphorylation pathway.
Gene activation is a highly regulated process that requires the coordinated action of proteins to relieve chromatin repression and to promote transcriptional activation. Nuclear histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes provide a mechanistic link between chromatin destabilization and gene activation by acetylating the epsilon-amino group of specific lysine residues within the aminoterminal tails of core histones to facilitate access to DNA by transcriptional activators. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the HAT domain of Tetrahymena GCN5 (tGCN5) bound with both its physiologically relevant ligands, coenzyme A (CoA) and a histone H3 peptide, and the structures of nascent tGCN5 and a tGCN5/acetyl-CoA complex. Our structural data reveal histone-binding specificity for a random-coil structure containing a G-K-X-P recognition sequence, and show that CoA is essential for reorienting the enzyme for histone binding. Catalysis appears to involve water-mediated proton extraction from the substrate lysine by a glutamic acid general base and a backbone amide that stabilizes the transition-state reaction intermediate. Comparison with related N-acetyltransferases indicates a conserved structural framework for CoA binding and catalysis, and structural variability in regions associated with substrate-specific binding.
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important signal transducing enzymes, unique to eukaryotes, that are involved in many facets of cellular regulation. Initial research concentrated on defining the components and organization of MAPK signalling cascades, but recent studies have begun to shed light on the physiological functions of these cascades in the control of gene expression, cell proliferation and programmed cell death.
The protein kinase family of enzymes mediates the responses of eukaryotic cells to both inter- and intracellular signals. These enzymes are either serine/threonine-specific or tyrosine-specific. Many of the latter are transmembrane receptors and are important in transduction of extracellular signals across the plasma membrane, whereas few examples of receptor serine kinases have been reported. We have now identified a complementary DNA clone from Zea mays (L.) encoding a putative serine/threonine-specific protein kinase structurally related to the receptor tyrosine kinases. This structural similarity is evidence for a previously undescribed class of transmembrane receptor in higher plants likely to be involved in signal reception and transduction. Furthermore, the catalytic domain of this protein kinase is linked through a transmembrane domain to an extracellular domain similar to that of glycoproteins encoded in the self-incompatibility locus of Brassica which are involved in the self-recognition system between pollen and stigma.
Although the biological basis of schizophrenia is not known, possible causes include genetic defects, viruses, amines, brain structure and metabolism, neuroreceptors, and G proteins. The hypothesis of dopamine overactivity in schizophrenia is based on the fact that neuroleptics block dopamine D2 receptors in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic potencies. Moreover, dopamine D2 or D2-like receptors are elevated in postmortem schizophrenia brain tissue. This elevation, however, is only found in vivo using [11C]methylspiperone but not [11C]raclopride. The dopamine D4 receptor gene has not yet been excluded in schizophrenia because the 21 gene variants of D4 have not yet been tested. Because the link between D1 and D2 receptors is reduced in schizophrenia tissue, we tested whether one component of this link was sensitive to guanine nucleotide. We report here that the binding of [3H]raclopride to D2 receptors in schizophrenia was not sensitive to guanine nucleotide. This finding permitted analysis of data on the binding of [3H]emonapride to the D2, D3 and D4 receptors. We conclude that the combined density of D2 and D3 receptors (labelled by [3H]raclopride) is increased by only 10% in schizophrenia brain, as found by Farde et al., but that it is the density of dopamine D4 receptors which is sixfold elevated in schizophrenia. These findings resolve the apparent discrepancy, mentioned above, wherein the density of [11C]methylspiperone-labelled sites (D2, D3 and D4), but not that of [11C]raclopride-labelled sites (D2 and D3), was found elevated in the schizophrenia striatum.
Conversion of external signals into proliferative responses may be mediated by interactions between signaling pathways that control cell proliferation. Interactions between G alpha s, the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase, and Ras, an important element in growth factor signaling, were studied. Expression of activated G alpha s in NIH 3T3 cells increased intracellular concentrations of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and inhibited H-Ras-stimulated DNA synthesis and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Activated G alpha s and 8-Br-cAMP suppressed H-Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Apparently, G alpha s inhibits proliferative signals from Ras by stimulating cAMP production and activating protein kinase A.
While reversible histone modifications are linked to an ever-expanding range of biological functions, the demethylases for histone H4 lysine 20 and their potential regulatory roles remain unknown. Here we report that the PHD and Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing protein, PHF8, while using multiple substrates, including H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me2, also functions as an H4K20me1 demethylase. PHF8 is recruited to promoters by its PHD domain based on interaction with H3K4me2/3 and controls G1-S transition in conjunction with E2F1, HCF-1 (also known as HCFC1) and SET1A (also known as SETD1A), at least in part, by removing the repressive H4K20me1 mark from a subset of E2F1-regulated gene promoters. Phosphorylation-dependent PHF8 dismissal from chromatin in prophase is apparently required for the accumulation of H4K20me1 during early mitosis, which might represent a component of the condensin II loading process. Accordingly, the HEAT repeat clusters in two non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) condensin II subunits, N-CAPD3 and N-CAPG2 (also known as NCAPD3 and NCAPG2, respectively), are capable of recognizing H4K20me1, and ChIP-Seq analysis demonstrates a significant overlap of condensin II and H4K20me1 sites in mitotic HeLa cells. Thus, the identification and characterization of an H4K20me1 demethylase, PHF8, has revealed an intimate link between this enzyme and two distinct events in cell cycle progression.
It has been shown previously that deoxyguanosine residues in DNA are hydroxylated at the C-8 position both in vitro and in vivo to produce 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) by various agents that produce oxygen radicals such as reducing reagents-O2, metal ions-O2, polyphenol-H2O2-Fe3+, asbestos-H2O2 or ionizing radiation. These agents are mostly either mutagenic or carcinogenic; therefore, the formation of 8-OH-dG can also be considered a likely cause of mutation or carcinogenesis by oxygen radicals. It is of interest to know whether the 8-OH-dG residue in DNA is misread during DNA replication. To answer this question, we have examined the effect of the 8-OH-dG residue in DNA on the fidelity of DNA replication using a DNA synthesis system in vitro with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). The synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, with or without an 8-OH-dG residue in a specified position, were chemically synthesized and used as templates for DNA synthesis under the conditions of the dideoxy chain termination sequencing method. Surprisingly, in addition to misreading of the 8-OH-dG residue itself, pyrimidines next to the 8-OH-dG residue (G has not yet been tested) were also misread.
The role of protein degradation in mitochondrial homeostasis was explored by cloning of a gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that encodes a protein resembling the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent bacterial protease Lon. The predicted yeast protein has a typical mitochondrial matrix-targeting sequence at its amino terminus. Yeast cells lacking a functional LON gene contained a nonfunctional mitochondrial genome, were respiratory-deficient, and lacked an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity present in the mitochondria of Lon+ cells. Lon- cells were also impaired in their ability to catalyze the energy-dependent degradation of several mitochondrial matrix proteins and they accumulated electron-dense inclusions in their mitochondrial matrix.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, an effective RNA interference (RNAi) response requires the production of secondary short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by RNA-directed RNA polymerases (RdRPs). We cloned secondary siRNAs from transgenic C. elegans lines expressing a single 22-nucleotide primary siRNA. Several secondary siRNAs start a few nucleotides downstream of the primary siRNA, indicating that non-RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)-cleaved mRNAs are substrates for secondary siRNA production. In lines expressing primary siRNAs with single-nucleotide mismatches, secondary siRNAs do not carry the mismatch but contain the nucleotide complementary to the mRNA. We infer that RdRPs perform unprimed RNA synthesis. Secondary siRNAs are only of antisense polarity, carry 5' di- or triphosphates, and are only in the minority associated with RDE-1, the RNAi-specific Argonaute protein. Therefore, secondary siRNAs represent a distinct class of small RNAs. Their biogenesis depends on RdRPs, and we propose that each secondary siRNA is an individual RdRP product.
Parkinson's disease is a pervasive, ageing-related neurodegenerative disease the cardinal motor symptoms of which reflect the loss of a small group of neurons, the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Mitochondrial oxidant stress is widely viewed as being responsible for this loss, but why these particular neurons should be stressed is a mystery. Here we show, using transgenic mice that expressed a redox-sensitive variant of green fluorescent protein targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, that the engagement of plasma membrane L-type calcium channels during normal autonomous pacemaking created an oxidant stress that was specific to vulnerable SNc dopaminergic neurons. The oxidant stress engaged defences that induced transient, mild mitochondrial depolarization or uncoupling. The mild uncoupling was not affected by deletion of cyclophilin D, which is a component of the permeability transition pore, but was attenuated by genipin and purine nucleotides, which are antagonists of cloned uncoupling proteins. Knocking out DJ-1 (also known as PARK7 in humans and Park7 in mice), which is a gene associated with an early-onset form of Parkinson's disease, downregulated the expression of two uncoupling proteins (UCP4 (SLC25A27) and UCP5 (SLC25A14)), compromised calcium-induced uncoupling and increased oxidation of matrix proteins specifically in SNc dopaminergic neurons. Because drugs approved for human use can antagonize calcium entry through L-type channels, these results point to a novel neuroprotective strategy for both idiopathic and familial forms of Parkinson's disease.
Electrophoretically distinct forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-specific isocritrate dehydrogenase have been observed in extracts of Escherichia coli grown under different culture conditions. In glucose-grown cells, two distinct bands of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity were observed on polyacrylamide gels and have been completely resolved by employing ion-exchange chromatography. These multiple forms of the enzyme have been studied and their possible metabolic role is discussed.
Rac GTPases regulate the actin cytoskeleton to control changes in cell shape. To date, the analysis of Rac function during development has relied heavily on the use of dominant mutant isoforms. Here, we use loss-of-function mutations to show that the three Drosophila Rac genes, Rac1, Rac2 and Mtl, have overlapping functions in the control of epithelial morphogenesis, myoblast fusion, and axon growth and guidance. They are not required for the establishment of planar cell polarity, as had been suggested on the basis of studies using dominant mutant isoforms. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Trio, is essential for Rac function in axon growth and guidance, but not for epithelial morphogenesis or myoblast fusion. Different Rac activators thus act in different developmental processes. The specific cellular response to Rac activation may be determined more by the upstream activator than the specific Rac protein involved.
It is generally assumed that the machinery that transcribes genes is composed entirely of polypeptides. However, in vitro transcription by silkworm RNA polymerase III requires a transcription factor that is not a polypeptide. This component, TFIIIR, is distinct from the previously identified transcription components: RNA polymerase III, and the accessory factors TFIIIA, TFIIIB, TFIIIC, and TFIIID. The newly discovered TFIIIR is a macromolecule that appears to be composed of RNA. It is resistant to heat, detergent, phenol, protease, and deoxyribonuclease, but it is sensitive to alkali and ribonuclease.
Recognition of the oligosaccharide portion of ganglioside GM1 in membranes of target cells by the heat-labile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli is the crucial first step in its pathogenesis, as it is for the closely related cholera toxin. These toxins have five B subunits, which are essential for GM1 binding, and a single A subunit, which needs to be nicked by proteolysis and reduced, yielding an A1-'enzyme' and an A2-'linker' peptide. A1 is translocated across the membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, possibly after endocytosis, upon which it ADP-ribosylates the G protein Gs alpha. The mechanism of binding and translocation of these toxins has been extensively investigated, but how the protein is orientated on binding is still not clear. Knowing the precise arrangement of the ganglioside binding sites of the toxins will be useful for designing drugs against the diarrhoeal diseases caused by organisms secreting these toxins and in the development of oral vaccines against them. We present here the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin complexed with lactose. This reveals the location of the binding site of the terminal galactose of GM1, which is consistent with toxin binding to the target cell with its A1 fragment pointing away from the membrane. A small helix is identified at the carboxy terminus of A2 which emerges through the central pore of the B subunits and probably comes into contact with the membrane upon binding, whereas the A1 subunit is flexible with respect to the B pentamer.
Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is important in homeostasis of the immune system: for example, non-functional or autoreactive lymphocytes are eliminated through apoptosis. One member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, Fas (also known as CD95 or Apo-1), can trigger cell death and is essential for lymphocyte homeostasis. FADD/Mort1 is a Fas-associated protein that is thought to mediate apoptosis by recruiting the protease caspase-8. A dominant-negative mutant of FADD inhibits apoptosis initiated by Fas and other TNFR family members. Other proteins, notably Daxx, also bind Fas and presumably mediate a FADD-independent apoptotic pathway. Here we investigate the role of FADD in vivo by generating FADD-deficient mice. As homozygous mice die in utero, we generated FADD-/- embryonic stem cells and FADD-/- chimaeras in a background devoid of the recombination activating gene RAG-1, which activates rearrangement of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. We found that thymocyte subpopulations were apparently normal in newborn chimaeras. Fas-induced apoptosis was completely blocked, indicating that there are no redundant Fas apoptotic pathways. As these mice age, their thymocytes decrease to an undetectable level, although peripheral T cells are present in all older FADD-/- chimaeras. Unexpectedly, activation-induced proliferation is impaired in these FADD-/- T cells, despite production of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-2. These results and the similarities between FADD-/- mice and mice lacking the beta-subunit of the IL-2 receptor suggest that there is an unexpected connection between cell proliferation and apoptosis.
The trace element molybdenum is essential for nearly all organisms and forms the catalytic centre of a large variety of enzymes such as nitrogenase, nitrate reductases, sulphite oxidase and xanthine oxidoreductases. Nature has developed two scaffolds holding molybdenum in place, the iron-molybdenum cofactor and pterin-based molybdenum cofactors. Despite the different structures and functions of molybdenum-dependent enzymes, there are important similarities, which we highlight here. The biosynthetic pathways leading to both types of cofactor have common mechanistic aspects relating to scaffold formation, metal activation and cofactor insertion into apoenzymes, and have served as an evolutionary 'toolbox' to mediate additional cellular functions in eukaryotic metabolism.
Thrombin bound to platelets contributes to stop bleeding and, in pathological conditions, may cause vascular thrombosis. We have determined the structure of platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha (GpIbalpha) bound to thrombin at 2.3 angstrom resolution and defined two sites in GpIbalpha that bind to exosite II and exosite I of two distinct alpha-thrombin molecules, respectively. GpIbalpha occupancy may be sequential, as the site binding to alpha-thrombin exosite I appears to be cryptic in the unoccupied receptor but exposed when a first thrombin molecule is bound through exosite II. These interactions may modulate alpha-thrombin function by mediating GpIbalpha clustering and cleavage of protease-activated receptors, which promote platelet activation, while limiting fibrinogen clotting through blockade of exosite I.
A sequence of developmental events transforms neurons from their immature state to their mature, terminally differentiated state. The elav locus is one of the first examples of a gene that is expressed in neurons early during this developmental sequence. This gene has been shown to be required for the proper development of young neurons and for the maintenance of mature neurons. DNA sequence data presented in this report suggest that the elav gene product is an RNA binding protein, based on the presence of RNP (ribonucleoprotein) consensus sequences. This leads to the proposal that this protein is involved in the RNA metabolism of neurons.
Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2, also known as GPR183) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is required for humoral immune responses; polymorphisms in the receptor have been associated with inflammatory autoimmune diseases. The natural ligand for EBI2 has been unknown. Here we describe the identification of 7a,25-dihydroxycholesterol (also called 7a,25-OHC or 5-cholesten-3b,7a,25-triol) as a potent and selective agonist of EBI2. Functional activation of human EBI2 by 7a,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols was verified by monitoring second messenger readouts and saturable, high-affinity radioligand binding. Furthermore, we find that 7a,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols act as chemoattractants for immune cells expressing EBI2 by directing cell migration in vitro and in vivo. A critical enzyme required for the generation of 7a,25-OHC is cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). Similar to EBI2 receptor knockout mice, mice deficient in CH25H fail to position activated B cells within the spleen to the outer follicle and mount a reduced plasma cell response after an immune challenge. This demonstrates that CH25H generates EBI2 biological activity in vivo and indicates that the EBI2-oxysterol signalling pathway has an important role in the adaptive immune response.
The heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) has an important role in the heat-shock response in vertebrates by inducing the expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and other cytoprotective proteins. HSF1 is present in unstressed cells in an inactive monomeric form and becomes activated by heat and other stress stimuli. HSF1 activation involves trimerization and acquisition of a site-specific DNA-binding activity, which is negatively regulated by interaction with certain HSPs. Here we show that HSF1 activation by heat shock is an active process that is mediated by a ribonucleoprotein complex containing translation elongation factor eEF1A and a previously unknown non-coding RNA that we term HSR1 (heat shock RNA-1). HSR1 is constitutively expressed in human and rodent cells and its homologues are functionally interchangeable. Both HSR1 and eEF1A are required for HSF1 activation in vitro; antisense oligonucleotides or short interfering (si)RNA against HSR1 impair the heat-shock response in vivo, rendering cells thermosensitive. The central role of HSR1 during heat shock implies that targeting this RNA could serve as a new therapeutic model for cancer, inflammation and other conditions associated with HSF1 deregulation.
A 12 amino-acid synthetic peptide (NANP)3 comprising the immunodominant epitope of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein was conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT), adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide, and administered intramuscularly in three doses at monthly intervals to 35 healthy males as a malaria vaccine. No significant adverse reactions were noted, with mild soreness at the injection site the only common symptom. Seroconversions against NANP occurred in 53% and 71% of recipients of 100 or 160 micrograms, respectively, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Most ELISA-positive sera reacted with sporozoites by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). Three vaccinees with the highest ELISA and IFA titres and four unimmunized controls were challenged with P. falciparum sporozoites introduced via the bites of infective Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood stage parasites were detected in all controls by 10 days (mean 8.5 days, range 7-10). In contrast, the two vaccinees who became infected did not manifest parasitaemia until day 11 and the third vacinee showed neither parasites nor symptoms during the 29 day observation period. This first synthetic peptide parenteral vaccine against a communicable disease tested in man is safe and stimulates biologically active antibodies. These observations encourage the development of improved vaccine formulations which, by enhancing immunogenicity, may lead to practical vaccines to assist in the control of falciparum malaria.
Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a protein essential for the development and maintenance of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, causing responsive neurones to increase in size and to extend neurites. Biochemically, the selective induction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase key enzymes in catecholamine biosynthesis is one of its most characteristic effects. Both the morphological and biochemical effects are modulated by glucocorticoids, suggesting a close relationship between specific effects of NGF and hormone action. NGF has been shown to induce an increase in adrenal cyclic AMP in intact but not in hypophysectomised rats, and so we have looked directly at the effect of systemic administration of NGF on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. We report here that NGF induced an enhanced secretion of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and a prolonged increase in plasma glucocorticoid concentration after intravenous (i.v.) injection. Such effects could have important implications for the biological activity of NGF.
Insulin is produced from an inactive precursor, proinsulin, through initial endoproteolytic cleavage at sites marked by pairs of basic amino-acid residues. We report here that lysates of insulin secretory granules contain two distinct Ca-dependent acidic endoproteases; one (type I) cleaving exclusively on the C-terminal side of Arg 31.Arg 32 (B-chain/C-peptide junction), the other (type II) preferentially on the C-terminal side of Lys 64.Arg 65 of proinsulin (C-peptide/A-chain junction). The Ca and pH requirements of these proteinases suggested that the type-II proteinase would be active in the Golgi apparatus and the secretory granule, whereas type-I activity would be compatible only with the intragranular environment. Kinetic analyses of (pro)insulin conversion intermediates in [35S]methionine-pulsed rat islets support this supposition. Our results suggest a simple mechanism whereby different dibasic sites can be cleaved in different cellular compartments. In conjunction with the regulation of the ionic composition of such compartments and the operation of post-Golgi segregation, our results also suggest how proteolytic conversion of diverse proproteins destined for different cellular sites can occur differentially and in a regulated manner.
The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) regulates two signal transduction pathways: the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and tyrosine kinase pathways. Stimulation of T cells with antigen or anti-TCR monoclonal antibodies induces an increase in inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol, the second messengers responsible for the mobilization of cytoplasmic free calcium and activation of protein kinase C-4. The TCR also activates a tyrosine kinase that is not intrinsic to the TCR. The relationship between these two signal transduction pathways and their contribution to later T-cell responses is unclear. Studies using variants of a murine hybridoma suggested that the PtdIns pathway might not be necessary for or be involved in regulating interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. To address the relationship between later T-cell responses and the early biochemical signals, we investigated the ability of a heterologous receptor with defined signal transduction function to induce T-cell activation. The human muscarinic subtype-1 receptor (HM1), which elicits PtdIns metabolism in neuronal cells through a G protein-coupled mechanism, also functionally activates this pathway when expressed in the T-cell line Jurkat-derived host, J-HM1-2.2 (ref.8). We show here that stimulation of HM1 alone induced IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor alpha chain expression. HM1 does not induce the tyrosine kinase pathway, suggesting that this pathway does not directly influence later T cell-activation responses. Instead, our studies indicate that activation of the PtdIns pathway is probably sufficient to induce later T-cell responses.
A molecular dynamics simulation of myoglobin provides the first direct demonstration that the potential energy surface of a protein is characterized by a large number of thermally accessible minima in the neighborhood of the native structure (for example, approximately 2000 minima were sampled in a 300-picosecond trajectory). This is expected to have important consequences for the interpretation of the activity of transport proteins and enzymes. Different minima correspond to changes in the relative orientation of the helices coupled with side-chain rearrangements that preserve the close packing of the protein interior. The conformational space sampled by the simulation is similar to that found in the evolutionary development of the globins. Glasslike behavior is expected at low temperatures. The minima obtained from the trajectory do not satisfy certain criteria for ultrametricity.
The nucleoli of vertebrate cells contain a number of small RNAs that are generated by the processing of intron fragments of protein-coding gene transcripts. The host gene (UHG) for intro-encoded human U22 is unusual in that it specifies a polyadenylated but apparently noncoding RNA. Depletion of U22 from Xenopus oocytes by oligonucleotide-directed ribonuclease H targeting prevented the processing of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at both ends. The appearance of 18S rRNA was restored by injection of in vitro-synthesized U22 RNA. These results identify a cellular function for an intron-encoded small RNA.
The four receptors of the Notch family are widely expressed transmembrane proteins that function as key conduits through which mammalian cells communicate to regulate cell fate and growth. Ligand binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor negative regulatory region (NRR) that enables ADAM protease cleavage at a juxtamembrane site that otherwise lies buried within the quiescent NRR. Subsequent intramembrane proteolysis catalysed by the gamma-secretase complex liberates the intracellular domain (ICD) to initiate the downstream Notch transcriptional program. Aberrant signalling through each receptor has been linked to numerous diseases, particularly cancer, making the Notch pathway a compelling target for new drugs. Although gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have progressed into the clinic, GSIs fail to distinguish individual Notch receptors, inhibit other signalling pathways and cause intestinal toxicity, attributed to dual inhibition of Notch1 and 2 (ref. 11). To elucidate the discrete functions of Notch1 and Notch2 and develop clinically relevant inhibitors that reduce intestinal toxicity, we used phage display technology to generate highly specialized antibodies that specifically antagonize each receptor paralogue and yet cross-react with the human and mouse sequences, enabling the discrimination of Notch1 versus Notch2 function in human patients and rodent models. Our co-crystal structure shows that the inhibitory mechanism relies on stabilizing NRR quiescence. Selective blocking of Notch1 inhibits tumour growth in pre-clinical models through two mechanisms: inhibition of cancer cell growth and deregulation of angiogenesis. Whereas inhibition of Notch1 plus Notch2 causes severe intestinal toxicity, inhibition of either receptor alone reduces or avoids this effect, demonstrating a clear advantage over pan-Notch inhibitors. Our studies emphasize the value of paralogue-specific antagonists in dissecting the contributions of distinct Notch receptors to differentiation and disease and reveal the therapeutic promise in targeting Notch1 and Notch2 independently.
The structure of present-day ferredoxin, with its simple, inorganic active site and its functions basic to photon-energy utilization, suggests the incorporation of its prototype into metabolism very early during biochemical evolution, even before complex proteins and the complete modern genetic code existed. The information in the amino acid sequence of ferredoxin enables us to propose a detailed reconstruction of its evolutionary history. Ferredoxin has evolved by doubling a shorter protein, which may have contained only eight of the simplest amino acids. This shorter ancestor in turn developed from a repeating sequence of the amino acids alanine, aspartic acid or proline, serine, and glycine. We explain the persistence of living relics of this primordial structure by invoking a conservative principle in evolutionary biochemistry: The processes of natural selection severely inhibit any change a well-adapted system on which several other essential components depend.
DNA polymerases change their specificity for nucleotide substrates with each catalytic cycle, while achieving error frequencies in the range of 10(-5) to 10(-6). Here we present a 2.2 A crystal structure of the replicative DNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7 complexed with a primer-template and a nucleoside triphosphate in the polymerase active site. The structure illustrates how nucleotides are selected in a template-directed manner, and provides a structural basis for a metal-assisted mechanism of phosphoryl transfer by a large group of related polymerases.
We describe a sensitive metabolite array for genome sequence-independent functional analysis of metabolic phenotypes and networks, the reactomes, of cell populations and communities. The array includes 1676 dye-linked substrate compounds collectively representing central metabolic pathways of all forms of life. Application of cell extracts to the array leads to specific binding of enzymes to cognate substrates, transformation to products, and concomitant activation of the dye signals. Proof of principle was shown by reconstruction of the metabolic maps of model bacteria. Utility of the array for unsequenced organisms was demonstrated by reconstruction of the global metabolisms of three microbial communities derived from acidic volcanic pool, deep-sea brine lake, and hydrocarbon-polluted seawater. Enzymes of interest are captured on nanoparticles coated with cognate metabolites, sequenced, and their functions unequivocally established.
We report here molecular mechanisms underlying a bacteria-archaeon symbiosis. We found that a fermentative bacterium used its flagellum for interaction with a specific methanogenic archaeon. The archaeon perceived a bacterial flagellum protein and activated its metabolism (methanogenesis). Transcriptome analyses showed that a substantial number of genes in the archaeon, including those involved in the methanogenesis pathway, were up-regulated after the contact with the flagellum protein. These findings suggest that the bacterium communicates with the archaeon by using its flagellum.
A DNA primase encoded by an IncI alpha plasmid promotes efficient DNA replication in a primase-defective mutant of Escherichia coli. This finding implies that the plasmid enzyme can prime discontinuous DNA synthesis of the bacterial chromosome. The plasmid gene encodes two large, antigenically related proteins which differ from E. coli primase.
Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is an acutely oncogenic avian retrovirus which induces sarcomas in animals and transforms fibroblasts in cell culture. Genetic analysis indicates that the viral src gene (v-src) mediates neoplastic transformation. The product of v-src is a 60,000 molecular weight (MW) phosphoprotein (pp60v-src) possessing the enzymatic activity of a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. The viral src gene is derived from a cellular gene (c-src) which also encodes a 60,000 MW phosphoprotein (pp60c-src) with tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity. Both birds and mammals are known to possess c-src. Shilo and Weinberg have reported that the genome of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains nucleotide sequences that are homologous to v-src. We report here the molecular cloning and chromosomal mapping of three loci from the Drosophila genome that contain such sequences. We also show that Drosophila contain both phosphotyrosine and a tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity immunoprecipitated by antisera directed against pp60v-src. It should now be possible to identify the precise locus that encodes a src-specific protein kinase in Drosophila, and to explore the role of c-src in the growth and development of D. melanogaster.
The met oncogene was previously isolated from a chemically transformed human cell line, MNNG-HOS. Recent evidence has demonstrated that two classes of transcripts are expressed from the met proto-oncogene locus. The met oncogene, however, expresses an aberrant RNA which has sequences in common with both transcripts. We now report partial nucleotide sequencing of the human met oncogene and show that met is related to the protein kinase oncogenes and growth factor receptors. The met nucleotide sequence is not identical to that of any published gene, and it is more closely homologous to the tyrosine kinases than to the serine/threonine kinases. Within the tyrosine kinase family, the sequenced met domains are most closely related to the human insulin receptor and the viral abl gene. In situ chromosome hybridization has mapped met to human chromosome 7 band 7q21-q31, a location distinct from that of other kinases. This is also a region associated with nonrandom chromosomal deletions observed in a portion of patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia. The accompanying paper shows that this chromosomal locus is also tightly linked with the human heredity disease cystic fibrosis.
Bacterially synthesized c-Ha-ras protein (Ras) was incubated with guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating (GA) protein in the presence of various phospholipids. The stimulation of Ras GTPase activity by GA protein was inhibited in some cases. Among the lipids most active in blocking GA protein activity were lipids that show altered metabolism during mitogenic stimulation. These included phosphatidic acid (containing arachidonic acid), phosphatidylinositol phosphates, and arachidonic acid. Other lipids, including phosphatidic acid with long, saturated side chains, diacylglycerols, and many other common phospholipids, were unable to alter GA protein activity. The interaction of lipids with GA protein might be important in the regulation of Ras activity during mitogenic stimulation.
Human stromelysin-3, a new member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, is expressed in tissues undergoing the active remodelling associated with embryonic development, wound healing and tumour invasion. But like all other members of the matrix metalloproteinase gene family, stromelysin-3 is synthesized as an inactive precursor that must be processed to its mature form in order to express enzymic activity. Here we identify stromelysin-3 as the first matrix metalloproteinase to be discovered that can be processed directly to its enzymically active form by an obligate intracellular proteolytic event that occurs within the constitutive secretory pathway. Intracellular activation is regulated by an unusual 10-amino-acid insert sandwiched between the pro- and catalytic-domains of stromelysin-3, which is encrypted with an Arg-X-Arg-X-Lys-Arg recognition motif for the Golgi-associated proteinase, furin, a mammalian homologue of the yeast Kex2 pheromone convertase. A furin-stromelysin-3 processing axis not only differentiates the regulation of this enzyme from all previously characterized matrix metalloproteinases, but also identifies pro-protein convertases as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in matrix-destructive disease states.
In eukaryotes the transcriptional control of RNA polymerase II-mediated gene expression is exerted by cis-acting regulatory DNA elements classified as promoter and enhancer sequences. These elements are composed of a number of different protein binding sites. The regulatory factors that recognize such 'modules' may be ubiquitous, tissue- or stage-specific, and positively or negatively acting. According to this model the transcriptional activity of a given gene is programmed by a combination of different modules. We analysed such a site of protein-DNA interaction, the octamer motif, in the enhancers of the simian virus (SV40) early genes and the murine immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, and in the distal sequence element (DSE) of the U2 small nuclear (sn)RNA gene of Xenopus laevis. The corresponding DNA-binding factor appears to be the same in the three cases. Moreover, a fraction containing partially purified octamer motif binding factor has a stimulatory effect on transcription in an in vitro system.
Kinesin-1 (conventional kinesin) is a dimeric motor protein that carries cellular cargoes along microtubules by hydrolysing ATP and moving processively in 8-nm steps. The mechanism of processive motility involves the hand-over-hand motion of the two motor domains ('heads'), a process driven by a conformational change in the neck-linker domain of kinesin. However, the 'waiting conformation' of kinesin between steps remains controversial-some models propose that kinesin adopts a one-head-bound intermediate, whereas others suggest that both the kinesin heads are bound to adjacent tubulin subunits. Addressing this question has proved challenging, in part because of a lack of tools to measure structural states of the kinesin dimer as it moves along a microtubule. Here we develop two different single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) sensors to detect whether kinesin is bound to its microtubule track by one or two heads. Our FRET results indicate that, while moving in the presence of saturating ATP, kinesin spends most of its time bound to the microtubule with both heads. However, when nucleotide binding becomes rate-limiting at low ATP concentrations, kinesin waits for ATP in a one-head-bound state and makes brief transitions to a two-head-bound intermediate as it walks along the microtubule. On the basis of these results, we suggest a model for how transitions in the ATPase cycle position the two kinesin heads and drive their hand-over-hand motion.
Transcription factor TFIIB is essential for the formation of RNA polymerase II initiation complexes where it binds to the TATA-binding protein (TBP) complex with DNA and recruits RNA polymerase II. TFIIB is probably a target for various activators. Several models have been proposed for the position of TFIIB in the TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex. Here we examine the structure of this complex using gel mobility-shift assays and hydroxyl-radical footprinting. TFIIB requires at least seven base pairs of DNA on either side of the TATA box to form a stable TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex. The sugar residues protected from hydroxyl-radical cleavage by the TFIIB-TBP complex were mapped on the crystal-structure model of the TBP-DNA complex. This analysis suggests that TFIIB binds beneath the concave surface of TBP, contacting DNA both upstream and downstream of the TATA box. Our model predicts that TFIIB binds close to the C-terminal stirrup of TBP and provides one explanation for why TBP needs to bend DNA.
The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a model system for studying many aspects of biology, including host responses to bacterial pathogens, but it is not known to support replication of any virus. Plants and insects encode multiple Dicer enzymes that recognize distinct precursors of small RNAs and may act cooperatively. However, it is not known whether the single Dicer of worms and mammals is able to initiate the small RNA-guided RNA interference (RNAi) antiviral immunity as occurs in plants and insects. Here we show complete replication of the Flock house virus (FHV) bipartite, plus-strand RNA genome in C. elegans. We show that FHV replication in C. elegans triggers potent antiviral silencing that requires RDE-1, an Argonaute protein essential for RNAi mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) but not by microRNAs. This immunity system is capable of rapid virus clearance in the absence of FHV B2 protein, which acts as a broad-spectrum RNAi inhibitor upstream of rde-1 by targeting the siRNA precursor. This work establishes a C. elegans model for genetic studies of animal virus-host interactions and indicates that mammals might use a siRNA pathway as an antiviral response.
Hairpin loops are important structural elements of RNA, helping to define the three-dimensional structure of large RNAs and providing potential nucleation sites for RNA folding and interaction with other nucleic acids and proteins. Little, however, is known about the conformation of RNA hairpins, most of what we know coming from transfer RNA crystal structures and from studies of DNA hairpins. We report here the determination of the structure of a very stable and common RNA hairpin, 5'GGAC(UUCG)GUCC (loop nucleotides in parenthesis), by NMR spectroscopy. The sequence C(UUCG)G occurs very often in RNA and may be a nucleation site for RNA folding and a protein-binding site. A high-resolution structure for the hairpin was derived from interproton distances and scalar coupling constants determined by NMR. The loop is stabilized by a G.U base pair, with guanine in the syn conformation, a cytosine-phosphate contact and extensive base stacking. These findings and other structural features of the loop can explain the unusual stability of the hairpin and suggest why reverse transcriptase cannot read through the loop, although it can transcribe through other kinds of RNA secondary structure.
Rotavirus, the major cause of life-threatening infantile gastroenteritis, is a member of the Reoviridae. Although the structures of rotavirus and other members of the Reoviridae have been extensively studied, little is known about the structures of virus-encoded non-structural proteins that are essential for genome replication and packaging. The non-structural protein NSP2 of rotavirus, which exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase, single-stranded RNA binding, and nucleic-acid helix-destabilizing activities, is a major component of viral replicase complexes. We present here the X-ray structure of the functional octamer of NSP2 determined to a resolution of 2.6 A. The NSP2 monomer has two distinct domains. The amino-terminal domain has a new fold. The carboxy-terminal domain resembles the ubiquitous cellular histidine triad (HIT) group of nucleotidyl hydrolases. This structural similarity suggests that the nucleotide-binding site is located inside the cleft between the two domains. Prominent grooves that run diagonally across the doughnut-shaped octamer are probable locations for RNA binding. Several RNA binding sites, resulting from the quaternary organization of NSP2 monomers, may be required for the helix destabilizing activity of NSP2 and its function during genome replication and packaging.
Methylmalonic aciduria is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by neonatal or infantile ketoacidosis. Leukocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of a 1-year-old child with this disorder converted negligible quantities of propionate-3-C(14) to carbon dioxide, but oxidized succinate-1,4-C(14) normally, an indication of a block in the conversion of propionate to succinate. Parenteral administration of vitamin B(18) resulted in a reduction in methylmalonic acid excretion and an increase in propionate oxidation by leukocytes in vitro. The results suggest a mutation of methylmalonyl-CoA isomerase, a vitamin B(12), dependent enzyme which converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, and provide the first demonstration of vitamin B(12) "dependency" in man.
Nature has evolved complex enzyme architectures that facilitate the synthesis and manipulation of the biopolymers DNA and RNA, including enzymes capable of attaching to the biopolymer substrate and performing several rounds of catalysis before dissociating. Many of these 'processive' enzymes have a toroidal shape and completely enclose the biopolymer while moving along its chain, as exemplified by the DNA enzymes T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme and lambda-exonucleoase. The overall architecture of these systems resembles that of rotaxanes, in which a long molecule or polymer is threaded through a macrocycle. Here we describe a rotaxane that mimics the ability of processive enzymes to catalyse multiple rounds of reaction while the polymer substrate stays bound. The catalyst consists of a substrate binding cavity incorporating a manganese(III) porphyrin complex that oxidizes alkenes within the toroid cavity, provided a ligand has been attached to the outer face of the toroid to both activate the porphyrin complex and shield it from being able to oxidize alkenes outside the cavity. We find that when threaded onto a polybutadiene polymer strand, this catalyst epoxidizes the double bonds of the polymer, thereby acting as a simple analogue of the enzyme systems.
How living systems detect the presence of genotoxic damage embedded in a million-fold excess of undamaged DNA is an unresolved question in biology. Here we have captured and structurally elucidated a base-excision DNA repair enzyme, MutM, at the stage of initial encounter with a damaged nucleobase, 8-oxoguanine (oxoG), nested within a DNA duplex. Three structures of intrahelical oxoG-encounter complexes are compared with sequence-matched structures containing a normal G base in place of an oxoG lesion. Although the protein-DNA interfaces in the matched complexes differ by only two atoms-those that distinguish oxoG from G-their pronounced structural differences indicate that MutM can detect a lesion in DNA even at the earliest stages of encounter. All-atom computer simulations show the pathway by which encounter of the enzyme with the lesion causes extrusion from the DNA duplex, and they elucidate the critical free energy difference between oxoG and G along the extrusion pathway.
Mammalian mitochondria contain about 1100 proteins, nearly 300 of which are uncharacterized. Given the well-established role of mitochondrial defects in human disease, functional characterization of these proteins may shed new light on disease mechanisms. Starting with yeast as a model system, we investigated an uncharacterized but highly conserved mitochondrial protein (named here Sdh5). Both yeast and human Sdh5 interact with the catalytic subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, a component of both the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Sdh5 is required for SDH-dependent respiration and for Sdh1 flavination (incorporation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor). Germline loss-of-function mutations in the human SDH5 gene, located on chromosome 11q13.1, segregate with disease in a family with hereditary paraganglioma, a neuroendocrine tumor previously linked to mutations in genes encoding SDH subunits. Thus, a mitochondrial proteomics analysis in yeast has led to the discovery of a human tumor susceptibility gene.
The type III ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) present in the archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis was found to participate in adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) metabolism, a role that is distinct from that of classical RuBisCOs of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Genes annotated as thymidine phosphorylase (deoA) and eucaryal translation initiation factor 2B (e2b2) were found to encode AMP phosphorylase and ribose-1,5-bisphosphate isomerase, respectively. These enzymes supplied the RuBisCO substrate, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, from AMP and phosphate. Archaea with type III RuBisCOs all harbor both DeoA and the corresponding E2b2 homologs. In this pathway, adenine was released from AMP and the phosphoribose moiety entered central-carbon metabolism.
Full-grown Xenopus oocytes arrest at the G2/M border of meiosis I. Progesterone breaks this arrest, leading to the resumption of the meiotic cell cycles and maturation of the oocyte into a fertilizable egg. In these oocytes, progesterone interacts with an unidentified surface-associated receptor, which induces a non-transcriptional signalling pathway that stimulates the translation of dormant c-mos messenger RNA. Mos, a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase, indirectly activates MAP kinase, which in turn leads to oocyte maturation. The translational recruitment of c-mos and several other mRNAs is regulated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation, a process that requires two 3' untranslated regions, the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) and the polyadenylation hexanucleotide AAUAAA. Although the signalling events that trigger c-mos mRNA polyadenylation and translation are unclear, they probably involve the activation of CPEB, the CPE binding factor. Here we show that an early site-specific phosphorylation of CPEB is essential for the polyadenylation of c-mos mRNA and its subsequent translation, and for oocyte maturation. In addition, we show that this selective, early phosphorylation of CPEB is catalysed by Eg2, a member of the Aurora family of serine/threonine protein kinases.
Most plants are known as C3 plants because the first product of photosynthetic CO2 fixation is a three-carbon compound. C4 plants, which use an alternative pathway in which the first product is a four-carbon compound, have evolved independently many times and are found in at least 18 families. In addition to differences in their biochemistry, photosynthetic organs of C4 plants show alterations in their anatomy and ultrastructure. Little is known about whether the biochemical or anatomical characteristics of C4 photosynthesis evolved first. Here we report that tobacco, a typical C3 plant, shows characteristics of C4 photosynthesis in cells of stems and petioles that surround the xylem and phloem, and that these cells are supplied with carbon for photosynthesis from the vascular system and not from stomata. These photosynthetic cells possess high activities of enzymes characteristic of C4 photosynthesis, which allow the decarboxylation of four-carbon organic acids from the xylem and phloem, thus releasing CO2 for photosynthesis. These biochemical characteristics of C4 photosynthesis in cells around the vascular bundles of stems of C3 plants might explain why C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently many times.
The proto-oncogene product c-Myc has a direct role in both metazoan cell growth and division. RNA polymerase III (pol III) is involved in the generation of transfer RNA and 5S ribosomal RNA, and these molecules must be produced in bulk to meet the need for protein synthesis in growing cells. We demonstrate here that c-Myc binds to TFIIIB, a pol III-specific general transcription factor, and directly activates pol III transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that endogenous c-Myc is present at tRNA and 5S rRNA genes in cultured mammalian cells. These results suggest that activation of pol III may have a role in the ability of c-Myc to stimulate cell growth.
Renin is an aspartyl proteinase that catalyses the first, and rate-limiting, step in the conversion of angiotensinogen to the hormone angiotensin II. The catalysis is highly specific, and plays an important physiological part in the regulation of blood pressure. For this reason inhibitors of renin are of potential value in the treatment of certain forms of hypertension. Although progress has been made in the design of inhibitors for clinical use by modification of angiotensinogen sequences, and as pepstatin analogues or with reduced peptide bonds, we have now provided the basis for a more rational approach by the use of interactive computer graphics techniques to build a three-dimensional model of renin. The model is based on the three-dimensional structure of endothia pepsin and the primary structure of mouse renin, which is very similar to that of the human enzyme. We show that renin may have a three-dimensional structure similar to that of other aspartyl proteinases.
Hereditary ovalocytosis is common in some areas of Melanesia and South East Asia where malaria is endemic. These red cells resist invasion by malarial parasites in vitro and ovalocytic individuals are less parasitized than normal. This has been attributed to the greater rigidity of ovalocytic red cells. It has been suggested that South East Asian ovalocytosis results from the heterozygous presence of an altered membrane anion transporter (band 3). We have used the polymerase chain reaction to clone the abnormal band 3 complementary DNA from an ovalocytic of Indian origin and found two changes from the normal protein: a point mutation (Lys 56----Glu) and the deletion of the sequence AFSPQVLAA (residues 400-408), but no evidence for an N-terminal extension. The deletion is also found in the abnormal band 3 of South East Asian ovalocytes and seems to be responsible for the unusual properties of the ovalocytic red cell. We show here that the membrane domain of the abnormal ovalocyte band 3 has a substantially altered structure and that the protein is defective in anion transport activity. The changed transport properties of the red cells may have a role in the reduced parasitaemia of ovalocytic individuals.
The rod and cone transducins are specific G proteins originally thought to be present only in photoreceptor cells of the vertebrate retina. Transducins convert light stimulation of photoreceptor opsins into activation of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (reviewed in refs. 5-7). A transducin-like G protein, gustducin, has been identified and cloned from rat taste cells. We report here that rod transducin is also present in vertebrate taste cells, where it specifically activates a phosphodiesterase isolated from taste tissue. Furthermore, the bitter compound denatonium in the presence of taste-cell membranes activates transducin but not Gi. A peptide that competitively inhibits rhodopsin activation of transducin also blocks taste-cell membrane activation of transducin, arguing for the involvement of a seven-transmembrane-helix G-protein-coupled receptor. These results suggest that rod transducin transduces bitter taste by coupling taste receptor(s) to taste-cell phosphodiesterase. Phosphodieterase-mediated degradation of cyclic nucleotides may lead to taste-cell depolarization through the recently identified cyclic-nucleotide-suppressible conductance.
The structure of a highly conserved complex between a 58-nucleotide domain of large subunit ribosomal RNA and the RNA-binding domain of ribosomal protein L11 has been solved at 2.8 angstrom resolution. It reveals a precisely folded RNA structure that is stabilized by extensive tertiary contacts and contains an unusually large core of stacked bases. A bulge loop base from one hairpin of the RNA is intercalated into the distorted major groove of another helix; the protein locks this tertiary interaction into place by binding to the intercalated base from the minor groove side. This direct interaction with a key ribosomal RNA tertiary interaction suggests that part of the role of L11 is to stabilize an unusual RNA fold within the ribosome.
Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is generated by natural and anthropogenic processes and has a critical role in environmental chemistry. It has an ozone-depleting potential similar to that of hydrochlorofluorocarbons as well as a global warming potential exceeding that of CO(2) 300-fold. In bacterial denitrification, N(2)O is reduced to N(2) by the copper-dependent nitrous oxide reductase (N(2)OR). This enzyme carries the mixed-valent Cu(A) centre and the unique, tetranuclear Cu(Z) site. Previous structural data were obtained with enzyme isolated in the presence of air that is catalytically inactive without prior reduction. Its Cu(Z) site was described as a [4Cu:S] centre, and the substrate-binding mode and reduction mechanism remained elusive. Here we report the structure of purple N(2)OR from Pseudomonas stutzeri, handled under the exclusion of dioxygen, and locate the substrate in N(2)O-pressurized crystals. The active Cu(Z) cluster contains two sulphur atoms, yielding a [4Cu:2S] stoichiometry; and N(2)O bound side-on at Cu(Z), in close proximity to Cu(A). With the substrate located between the two clusters, electrons are transferred directly from Cu(A) to N(2)O, which is activated by side-on binding in a specific binding pocket on the face of the [4Cu:2S] centre. These results reconcile a multitude of available biochemical data on N(2)OR that could not be explained by earlier structures, and outline a mechanistic pathway in which both metal centres and the intervening protein act in concert to achieve catalysis. This structure represents the first direct observation, to our knowledge, of N(2)O bound to its reductase, and sheds light on the functionality of metalloenzymes that activate inert small-molecule substrates. The principle of using distinct clusters for substrate activation and for reduction may be relevant for similar systems, in particular nitrogen-fixing nitrogenase.
The protein Sec4p plays an essential role at the final stage of the yeast secretory pathway and belongs to the ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins, more specifically to a branch that includes Ypt1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and rab proteins in mammalian cells. GTP-binding proteins change conformation depending on whether GTP or GDP is bound and can thus act as a regulatory switch. The protein remains in its inactive, GDP-bound form until exchange of GTP for GDP allows it to stimulate a downstream effector. This interaction is curtailed by GTP hydrolysis. The rates of nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis can be regulated by interaction with accessory proteins. Although GDP dissociation stimulators (GDS) have been identified that act on members of the ras and rho branches of the superfamily, less is known regarding GDSs that act on members of the Sec4/Ypt1/Rab subgroup. A preliminary characterization of a Rab3A GDP dissociation stimulating activity has been presented. We report here the use of suppressor analysis to clone a gene, dss4, encoding a 17K protein that aids Sec4p action in vivo by functioning as a GDP dissociation stimulator.
In mammals, the hydroperoxidation of arachidonic acid by lipoxygenases leads to the formation of leukotrienes and lipoxins, compounds that mediate inflammatory responses. Lipoxygenases are dioxygenases that contain a nonheme iron and are present in many animal cells. Soybean lipoxygenase-1 is a single-chain, 839-residue protein closely related to mammalian lipoxygenases. The structure of soybean lipoxygenase-1 solved to 2.6 angstrom resolution shows that the enzyme has two domains: a 146-residue beta barrel and a 693-residue helical bundle. The iron atom is in the center of the larger domain and is coordinated by three histidines and the COO- of the carboxyl terminus. The coordination geometry is nonregular and appears to be a distorted octahedron in which two adjacent positions are not occupied by ligands. Two cavities, in the shapes of a bent cylinder and a frustum, connect the unoccupied positions to the surface of the enzyme. The iron, with two adjacent and unoccupied positions, is poised to interact with the 1,4-diene system of the substrate and with molecular oxygen during catalysis.
Certain synthetic homo- and copolyribonucleotide polymers are capable of releasing the DNA template restriction of isolated nuclei of rat liver cells when assayed with an excess of or in the absence of exogenous DNA polymerase. The purine homopolyribonucleotides are far more effective than are the pyrimidine polymers.
We have identified the xenobiotic receptor CAR (constitutive androstane receptor) as a key regulator of acetaminophen metabolism and hepatotoxicity. Known CAR activators as well as high doses of acetaminophen induced expression of three acetaminophen-metabolizing enzymes in wild-type but not in CAR null mice, and the CAR null mice were resistant to acetaminophen toxicity. Inhibition of CAR activity by administration of the inverse agonist ligand androstanol 1 hour after acetaminophen treatment blocked hepatotoxicity in wild type but not in CAR null mice. These results suggest an innovative therapeutic approach for treating the adverse effects of acetaminophen and potentially other hepatotoxic agents.
Apoptosis is executed by caspases, which undergo proteolytic activation in response to cell death stimuli. The apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) controls caspase activation downstream of mitochondria. During apoptosis, Apaf-1 binds to cytochrome c and in the presence of ATP/dATP forms an apoptosome, leading to the recruitment and activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-9 (ref. 2). The mechanisms underlying Apaf-1 function are largely unknown. Here we report the 2.2-A crystal structure of an ADP-bound, WD40-deleted Apaf-1, which reveals the molecular mechanism by which Apaf-1 exists in an inactive state before ATP binding. The amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain packs against a three-layered alpha/beta fold, a short helical motif and a winged-helix domain, resulting in the burial of the caspase-9-binding interface. The deeply buried ADP molecule serves as an organizing centre to strengthen interactions between these four adjoining domains, thus locking Apaf-1 in an inactive conformation. Apaf-1 binds to and hydrolyses ATP/dATP and their analogues. The binding and hydrolysis of nucleotides seem to drive conformational changes that are essential for the formation of the apoptosome and the activation of caspase-9.
The large T antigen (T) of simian virus 40 is a multifunctional protein required for both viral DNA replication and cellular transformation. T antigen forms specific protein complexes with the host protein p53 in both virus-infected and transformed cells. p53 has recently been shown to be an oncogene, but its normal function is not clear. We previously established a radioimmunoassay to study the newly described complex between T antigen and DNA polymerase alpha, and have noted a similarity between the antigenic changes induced in T by the binding of both p53 and polymerase. We now extend this analysis to a larger collection of anti-T antibodies and formally establish that p53 and DNA polymerase alpha can compete for binding to the SV40 T antigen. At a critical concentration of the three components it is possible to detect a trimeric complex of T, p53 and DNA polymerase alpha. Our observations have important implications for the control by these nuclear oncogenes of viral and cellular DNA synthesis and viral host range in both normal and transformed cells. We present a model for the action of p53 in growth control.
In yeast a type II integral membrane glycoprotein that is essential for transport vesicle budding from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is encoded by SEC12 (refs 1-3). SAR1 was discovered as a multicopy suppressor of the sec12-1ts strain and encodes a GTPase of M(r) 21,000 (21K) also essential for vesicle budding from the ER. Sar1 is a peripherally associated membrane protein which shows enhanced membrane binding in cells containing elevated levels of Sec12 protein (refs 6, 7). We show here that a purified fragment of Sec12 promotes guanine-nucleotide dissociation from Sar1 whereas the purified mutant Sec12-1 has only 15% of the wild-type activity. GTP hydrolysis by Sar1 is not enhanced by Sec12, but is stimulated more than 50-fold by a mixture of Sec12 and Sec23, a GTPase-activating protein specific for Sar1 (ref. 8). We propose that Sec12 catalyses Sar1 guanine-nucleotide exchange in a process that recruits Sar1 to a vesicle formation site on the ER membrane.
The myotonic dystrophy mutation has recently been identified; however, the molecular mechanism of the disease is still unknown. The sequence of the myotonin-protein kinase gene was determined, and messenger RNA spliced forms were identified in various tissues. Antisera were developed for analytical studies. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and radioimmunoassay were used to demonstrate that decreased levels of the messenger RNA and protein expression are associated with the adult form of myotonic dystrophy.
Aurones are plant flavonoids that provide yellow color to the flowers of some popular ornamental plants, such as snapdragon and cosmos. In this study, we have identified an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of aurone from chalcones in the yellow snapdragon flower. The enzyme (aureusidin synthase) is a 39-kilodalton, copper-containing glycoprotein catalyzing the hydroxylation and/or oxidative cyclization of the precursor chalcones, 2',4',6',4-tetrahydroxychalcone and 2',4',6',3,4-pentahydroxychalcone. The complementary DNA encoding aureusidin synthase is expressed in the petals of aurone-containing varieties. DNA sequence analysis revealed that aureusidin synthase belongs to the plant polyphenol oxidase family, providing an unequivocal example of the function of the polyphenol oxidase homolog in plants, i.e., flower coloration.
In the galea of silkmoths undergoing metamorphosis, generalized epidermal cells, which had previousty secreted pupal cuticle, transform into highly specialized cells producing a new protein, the enzyme cocoonase. These cells first segregate by mitosis and displacement, then grow rapidly through endomitosis and accumulation of RNA-rich cytoplasm, and finally begin rapid synthesis of cocoonase. Replication of DNA continues in fully differentiated cells synthesizing cocoonase.
All life that is known to exist on Earth today and all life for which there is evidence in the geological record seems to be of the same form--one based on DNA genomes and protein enzymes. Yet there are strong reasons to conclude that DNA- and protein-based life was preceded by a simpler life form based primarily on RNA. This earlier era is referred to as the 'RNA world', during which the genetic information resided in the sequence of RNA molecules and the phenotype derived from the catalytic properties of RNA.
The risk of atherosclerosis, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and death, is inversely related to plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, although the mechanism of this protective effect is unclear. The class B scavenger receptor, SR-BI, is the first HDL receptor to be well defined at a molecular level and is a mediator of selective cholesterol uptake in vitro. It is expressed most abundantly in steroidogenic tissues, where it is coordinately regulated with steroidogenesis by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and oestrogen, and in the liver, where its expression in rats is suppressed by oestrogen. Here we show that adenovirus-mediated, hepatic overexpression of SR-BI in mice on both sinusoidal and canalicular surfaces of hepatocytes results in the virtual disappearance of plasma HDL and a substantial increase in biliary cholesterol. SR-BI may directly mediate these effects by increasing hepatic HDL cholesterol uptake or by increasing cholesterol secretion into bile, or both. These results indicate that SR-BI may be important in hepatic HDL metabolism, in determining plasma HDL concentrations, and in controlling cholesterol concentrations in bile, and thus may influence the development and progression of atherosclerosis and gallstone disease.
Three different prenyltransferases have been identified in yeast and higher cells, the farnesyltransferase and the type I and type II geranylgeranyltransferases (GGTase). The farnesyltransferase and GGTase-I modify peptides in vitro with the CAAX (C, Cys; A, aliphatic residue; X, terminal amino acid) consensus motif. These enzymes are heterodimers that have different beta-subunits and a shared alpha-subunit. In yeast, the RAM2 gene encodes this alpha-subunit. RAM2 is also homologous to MAD2, a yeast gene whose product has been implicated in the feedback control of mitosis. We have shown that Bet2p is a component of the yeast GGTase-II (refs 6, 12) that geranylgeranylates Ypt1p, a small GTP-binding protein that mediates transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Here we report that Mad2p is a component of this enzyme. Bet2p forms a complex with Mad2p that appears to bind geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate. The efficient transfer of geranylgeranyl onto small GTP-binding proteins requires the presence of an additional activity.
Factor IX is the precursor of a serine protease that functions in the intrinsic blood clotting pathway. Deficiencies in this plasma glycoprotein result in haemophilia B (or Christmas disease) and occur in about 1 in 30,000 males. Patients are currently treated with fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrates prepared from pooled plasma from normal individuals. There are several problems with this method of treatment, including the probable exposure of the patients to contaminants such as the viral agents responsible for hepatitis and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). As a first step towards an alternative source of pure human factor IX, we report here on the use of recombinant DNA techniques to produce biologically active factor IX in cultured mammalian cells. Stable cell lines were produced by cotransfecting a baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell line with a plasmid containing a gene for factor IX and a plasmid containing a selectable marker. Protein secreted by these cell lines reduces the clotting time of plasma from factor IX-deficient patients. We present additional evidence that this protein is authentic human factor IX.
The guanine nucleotide-binding stimulatory protein (Gs) couples hormone-receptor interaction to the activation of adenylate cyclase and the generation of cyclic AMP. Studies using frog neuroepithelium indicate that the sense of smell is mediated by a Gs-adenylate cyclase system, and this prompted us to test olfaction in the only known model of Gs deficiency in the animal kingdom, Gs-deficient (type 1a) pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP), which occurs in humans. Such patients are resistant to the cAMP-mediated actions of several hormones. (Although Henkin has reported disturbances in the sense of smell in six patients with PHP, currently available biochemical measurements such as the cAMP response to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and determination of Gs activity were not reported and olfactory testing was limited.) In the present study, we found that all Gs-deficient patients had impaired olfaction when compared with PHP patients who had normal Gs activity (type 1b PHP, in which patients are resistant only to the action of PTH in the kidney). This is the first evidence of human olfactory impairment which can be related to Gs deficiency and suggests that Gs-deficient PHP patients may be resistant to cAMP-mediated actions in other non-endocrine systems.
To survive in hostile environments, organisms activate stress-responsive transcriptional regulators that coordinately increase production of protective factors. Hypoxia changes cellular metabolism and thus activates redox-sensitive as well as oxygen-dependent signal transducers. We demonstrate that Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a redox-sensing deacetylase, selectively stimulates activity of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2alpha) during hypoxia. The effect of Sirt1 on HIF-2alpha required direct interaction of the proteins and intact deacetylase activity of Sirt1. Select lysine residues in HIF-2alpha that are acetylated during hypoxia confer repression of Sirt1 augmentation by small-molecule inhibitors. In cultured cells and mice, decreasing or increasing Sirt1 activity or levels affected expression of the HIF-2alpha target gene erythropoietin accordingly. Thus, Sirt1 promotes HIF-2 signaling during hypoxia and likely other environmental stresses.
The presence of macrophages is required for the regeneration of many cell types during wound healing. Macrophages have been reported to express a wide range of mitogenic factors and cytokines, but none of these factors has been shown in vivo to sustain all the wound-healing processes. It has been suggested that transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) may mediate angiogenesis, epidermal regrowth, and formation of granulation tissue in vivo. Macrophages isolated from a wound site, and not exposed to cell culture conditions, expressed messenger RNA transcripts for TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, platelet-derived growth factor A-chain, and insulin-like growth factor-1. The expression of these transcripts was determined by a novel method for RNA analysis in which low numbers of mouse macrophages were isolated from wound cylinders, their RNA was purified and reverse-transcribed, and the complementary DNA was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction primed with growth factor sequence-specific primers. This single-cell RNA phenotyping procedure is rapid and has the potential for quantification, and mRNA transcripts from a single cell or a few cells can be unambiguously demonstrated, with the simultaneous analysis of several mRNA species. Macrophages from wounds expressed TGF-alpha antigen, and wound fluids contained TGF-alpha. Elicited macrophages in culture also expressed TGF-alpha transcripts and polypeptide in a time-dependent manner after stimulation with modified low-density lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, which are characteristic of the activators found in injured tissues.
Three variations to the structure of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus were made to try to change the substrate specificity from lactate to malate: Asp197----Asn, Thr246----Gly, and Gln102----Arg). Each modification shifts the specificity from lactate to malate, although only the last (Gln102----Arg) provides an effective and highly specific catalyst for the new substrate. This synthetic enzyme has a ratio of catalytic rate (kcat) to Michaelis constant (Km) for oxaloacetate of 4.2 x 10(6)M-1 s-1, equal to that of native lactate dehydrogenase for its natural substrate, pyruvate, and a maximum velocity (250 s-1), which is double that reported for a natural malate dehydrogenase from B. stearothermophilus.
Lipoprotein lipase is a key enzyme of lipid metabolism that acts to hydrolyze triglycerides, providing free fatty acids for cells and affecting the maturation of circulating lipoproteins. It has been proposed that the enzyme plays a role in the development of obesity and atherosclerosis. The human enzyme has been difficult to purify and its protein sequence was heretofore undetermined. A complementary DNA for human lipoprotein lipase that codes for a mature protein of 448 amino acids has now been cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the sequence indicates that human lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, and pancreatic lipase are members of a gene family. Two distinct species of lipoprotein lipase messenger RNA that arise from alternative sites of 3'-terminal polyadenylation were detected in several different tissues.
In mammalian cells, DNA damage increases the levels of the nuclear tumour-suppressor p53, resulting in elevated synthesis of p21, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). p21 may also directly block DNA replication by inhibiting the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an essential DNA replication protein. However, PCNA is also required for nucleotide-excision repair of DNA, an intrinsic part of the cellular response to ultraviolet irradiation. Using an in vitro system, we now show that p21 does not block PCNA-dependent nucleotide-excision repair, in contrast to its inhibition of simian virus 40 DNA replication. Furthermore, the short gap-filling DNA synthesis by PCNA-dependent DNA polymerases delta and epsilon is less sensitive to inhibition by p21 than is long primer-extension synthesis. The ability of p21 to inhibit the role of PCNA in DNA replication but not in DNA repair rationalizes in vivo data showing that genetic damage leads to inactivation of chromosomal replication while allowing damage-responsive repair.
Osmoregulation, inhibitory neurotransmission and pH balance depend on chloride ion (Cl-) flux. In intestinal epithelial cells, apical Cl- channels control salt and fluid secretion and are, in turn, regulated by agonists acting through cyclic nucleotides and internal calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i). Recently, we found that muscarinic pretreatment prevents [Ca2+]i increases from eliciting Cl- secretion in T84 colonic epithelial cells. By studying concomitant inositol phosphate metabolism, we have now identified D-myo-inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(3,4,5,6)P4), as the inositol phosphate most likely to mediate this uncoupling. A novel, membrane-permeant ester prepared by total synthesis delivers Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 intracellularly and confirms that this emerging messenger does inhibit Cl- flux resulting from thapsigargin- or histamine-induced [Ca2+]i elevations.
Plants contain most of the growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in conjugated forms believed to be inactive in promoting growth. The iaglu gene, which controls the first step in the biosynthesis of the IAA conjugates of Zea mays, encodes (uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucose:indol-3-ylacetyl)-beta-D-glucosyl transferase. Protein synthesized by Escherichia coli that contained cloned 1-O-beta-D-indol-3-ylacetyl-glucose complementary DNA (cDNA) was catalytically active. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cDNA was confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing of the purified enzyme. Homologous nucleotide sequences were found in all plants tested. The blockage or enhancement of iaglu expression may permit regulation of plant growth.
Despite the essential roles of sphingolipids both as structural components of membranes and critical signalling molecules, we have a limited understanding of how cells sense and regulate their levels. Here we reveal the function in sphingolipid metabolism of the ORM genes (known as ORMDL genes in humans)-a conserved gene family that includes ORMDL3, which has recently been identified as a potential risk factor for childhood asthma. Starting from an unbiased functional genomic approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identify Orm proteins as negative regulators of sphingolipid synthesis that form a conserved complex with serine palmitoyltransferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid production. We also define a regulatory pathway in which phosphorylation of Orm proteins relieves their inhibitory activity when sphingolipid production is disrupted. Changes in ORM gene expression or mutations to their phosphorylation sites cause dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Our work identifies the Orm proteins as critical mediators of sphingolipid homeostasis and raises the possibility that sphingolipid misregulation contributes to the development of childhood asthma.
All cellular organisms use specialized RNA polymerases called "primases" to synthesize RNA primers for the initiation of DNA replication. The high-resolution crystal structure of a primase, comprising the catalytic core of the Escherichia coli DnaG protein, was determined. The core structure contains an active-site architecture that is unrelated to other DNA or RNA polymerase palm folds, but is instead related to the "toprim" fold. On the basis of the structure, it is likely that DnaG binds nucleic acid in a groove clustered with invariant residues and that DnaG is positioned within the replisome to accept single-stranded DNA directly from the replicative helicase.
Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1; MIM 254800) is an autosomal recessive disorder with onset between 6 and 13 years followed by variable progression to mental deterioration and cerebellar ataxia. It is a rare disorder but more common in Finland (1 in 20,000) and the western Mediterranean. Two point mutations in the cysteine proteinase inhibitor gene cystatin B (CSTB), proved that this gene is responsible for EPM1 (ref. 3). An extensive search in the CSTB gene revealed mutations accounting only for 14% of the 58 unrelated EPM1 alleles studied. Here we report that the majority of EPM1 alleles contain expansions of a dodecamer (12-mer) repeat located about 70 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site nearest to the 5' end of the CSTB gene. Normal alleles contain 2 or 3 copies of this repeat whereas mutant alleles contain more than 60 such repeats and have reduced levels of CSTB messenger RNA in blood but not in cell lines. 'Premutation' CSTB alleles with 12-17 repeats show marked instability when transmitted to offspring.
Nucleosomes, the nucleohistone subunits of chromatin, are present on transcribed eukaryotic genes but do not prevent transcription. It is shown here that the large yeast RNA polymerase III transcribes through a single nucleosome. This takes place through a direct internal nucleosome transfer in which histones never leave the DNA template. During this process, the polymerase pauses with a pronounced periodicity of 10 to 11 base pairs, which is consistent with restricted rotation in the DNA loop formed during transfer. Transcription through nucleosomes by the eukaryotic enzyme and by much smaller prokaryotic RNA polymerases thus shares many features, reflecting an important property of nucleosomes.
By competition with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), commonly occurring intracellular proteins, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and albumin, can protect LDH-1 and LDH-5 from inhibition and ternary complex formation with NAD and pyruvate. The existence of intracellular proteins that compete with LDH for NAD renders unphysiological a model for estimating the extent of intracellular LDH inhibition based on incubations of only LDH, NAD, and pyruvate.
Aminoacyl-tRNA's from Sarcina lutea were tested for incorporation into protein in a heterologous system from Escherichia coli or for biniding in a homologous system from Sarcina lutea. Aminoacyl-tRNA's from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested for biniding in a homologous Saccharomyces cerevisiae system. Synthetic polyribonucleotides were used as messengers. The code which exists in Sarcina lutea and Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the same as in Escherichia coli.
The Pb2+ and Zn2+ ions are efficient catalysts for the polycytidylic acid-directed polymerization of an activated guanylic acid derivative, guanosine 5'-phosphorimidazolide. The products include oligomers of 30 to 40 units in length. The nucleotide residues are predominantly 2'-5' linked when Pb2+ is the catalyst, and predominantly 3'-5' linked in the presence of Zn2+. The significance of these results in the context of the prebiotic evolution of RNA polymerase is discussed.
Rab GTPases regulate all stages of membrane trafficking, including vesicle budding, cargo sorting, transport, tethering and fusion. In the inactive (GDP-bound) conformation, accessory factors facilitate the targeting of Rab GTPases to intracellular compartments. After nucleotide exchange to the active (GTP-bound) conformation, Rab GTPases interact with functionally diverse effectors including lipid kinases, motor proteins and tethering complexes. How effectors distinguish between homologous Rab GTPases represents an unresolved problem with respect to the specificity of vesicular trafficking. Using a structural proteomic approach, we have determined the specificity and structural basis underlying the interaction of the multivalent effector rabenosyn-5 with the Rab family. The results demonstrate that even the structurally similar effector domains in rabenosyn-5 can achieve highly selective recognition of distinct subsets of Rab GTPases exclusively through interactions with the switch and interswitch regions. The observed specificity is determined at a family-wide level by structural diversity in the active conformation, which governs the spatial disposition of critical conserved recognition determinants, and by a small number of both positive and negative sequence determinants that allow further discrimination between Rab GTPases with similar switch conformations.
The proapoptotic Bax protein induces cell death by acting on mitochondria. Bax binds to the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), a composite proteaceous channel that is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability. Immunodepletion of Bax from PTPC or purification of PTPC from Bax-deficient mice yielded a PTPC that could not permeabilize membranes in response to atractyloside, a proapoptotic ligand of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). Bax and ANT coimmunoprecipitated and interacted in the yeast two-hybrid system. Ectopic expression of Bax induced cell death in wild-type but not in ANT-deficient yeast. Recombinant Bax and purified ANT, but neither of them alone, efficiently formed atractyloside-responsive channels in artificial membranes. Hence, the proapoptotic molecule Bax and the constitutive mitochondrial protein ANT cooperate within the PTPC to increase mitochondrial membrane permeability and to trigger cell death.
The E6AP ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) mediates the human papillomavirus-induced degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor in cervical cancer and is mutated in Angelman syndrome, a neurological disorder. The crystal structure of the catalytic hect domain of E6AP reveals a bilobal structure with a broad catalytic cleft at the junction of the two lobes. The cleft consists of conserved residues whose mutation interferes with ubiquitin-thioester bond formation and is the site of Angelman syndrome mutations. The crystal structure of the E6AP hect domain bound to the UbcH7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) reveals the determinants of E2-E3 specificity and provides insights into the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the E3.
Genetically encoded libraries of peptides and oligonucleotides are well suited for the identification of ligands for many macromolecules. A major drawback of these techniques is that the resultant ligands are subject to degradation by naturally occurring enzymes. Here, a method is described that uses a biologically encoded library for the identification of D-peptide ligands, which should be resistant to proteolytic degradation. In this approach, a protein is synthesized in the D-amino acid configuration and used to select peptides from a phage display library expressing random L-amino acid peptides. For reasons of symmetry, the mirror images of these phage-displayed peptides interact with the target protein of the natural handedness. The value of this approach was demonstrated by the identification of a cyclic D-peptide that interacts with the Src homology 3 domain of c- SRC. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that the binding site for this D-peptide partially overlaps the site for the physiological ligands of this domain.
Transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is thought to occur unidirectionally from most genes. Here, we present evidence of widespread divergent transcription at protein-encoding gene promoters. Transcription start site-associated RNAs (TSSa-RNAs) nonrandomly flank active promoters, with peaks of antisense and sense short RNAs at 250 nucleotides upstream and 50 nucleotides downstream of TSSs, respectively. Northern analysis shows that TSSa-RNAs are subsets of an RNA population 20 to 90 nucleotides in length. Promoter-associated RNAPII and H3K4-trimethylated histones, transcription initiation hallmarks, colocalize at sense and antisense TSSa-RNA positions; however, H3K79-dimethylated histones, characteristic of elongating RNAPII, are only present downstream of TSSs. These results suggest that divergent transcription over short distances is common for active promoters and may help promoter regions maintain a state poised for subsequent regulation.
The study of immunoglobulin genes at the molecular level can allow us to elucidate the origin of antibody diversity. Investigations of immunoglobulin gene structure in the mouse have shown that light chains are encoded by three gene segments: the C gene encoding the constant region and the V and J genes encoding the variable region. In antibody-producing cells the V and J genes join together to create a complete immunoglobulin gene. No data are available on the structure of human light chain variable region genes, but the variable regions of over 150 human kappa light chain proteins have been sequenced and they comprise four distinct subgroups. Here we report the complete DNA sequences of three human kappa variable region (V kappa) genes isolated from fetal liver DNA. The sequences demonstrate that two non-allelic genes encoding subgroup I proteins have more than 90% nucleotide homology in both proteins coding and non-coding regions. Comparison of these human genes with two complete DNA sequences of mouse V kappa genes shows that V kappa gene structure is highly conserved between the two species, which suggests that V kappa genes rearrange during the differentiation of human lymphocytes by a very similar mechanism to that in the mouse. The sequence of a defective V kappa gene is also described--this gene is unable to code for a functional immunoglobulin due to substitutions, deletions and insertions in its sequence. It is analogous to the pseudogenes of globin and Xenopus 5S RNA.
The path of the nucleic acids through a transcription elongation complex was tracked by mapping cross-links between bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) and transcript RNA or template DNA onto the x-ray crystal structure. In the resulting model, the downstream duplex DNA is nestled in a trough formed by the beta' subunit and enclosed on top by the beta subunit. In the RNAP channel, the RNA/DNA hybrid extends from the enzyme active site, along a region of the beta subunit harboring rifampicin resistance mutations, to the beta' subunit "rudder." The single-stranded RNA is then extruded through another channel formed by the beta-subunit flap domain. The model provides insight into the functional properties of the transcription complex.
In the myosin-linked regulatory mechanism typified by the molluscan scallop adductor muscle, contraction is controlled by Ca2+ binding to sites on the thick filament protein, myosin. The regulatory light chains of myosin heads are involved directly in this mechanism and early studies suggested that, in the absence of Ca2+, these subunits prevent the interaction of a myosin-adenosine nucleotide complex with the actin-containing thin filament. Subsequently, Ashiba et al. reported that the steady-state ATPase of molluscan myosin exhibits a limited degree of Ca2+ activation in the absence of actin. Recently, however, we have shown that steady-state ATPase activity in relaxing conditions is dominated by the unregulated molecules in the myosin preparation. Single-turnover kinetic methods are required to monitor the highly suppressed ATPase activity of the regulated population. Using the latter approach, we report here that scallop myosin ATPase is reduced about 100-fold on removal of Ca2+. The regulatory light chains maintain the relaxed state via conformational changes which suppress the product release steps, irrespective of the presence of actin.
The biological requirement of the trace element selenium was recognized 40 years ago. Selenium is incorporated into several enzymes and transfer RNA species of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. In enzymes which contain a selenopolypeptide, selenium is present as covalently bound selenocysteine which participates in the catalytic reaction. Sequence analysis of the genes coding for two selenoproteins, formate dehydrogenase H from Escherichia coli and glutathione peroxidase from mouse and man, demonstrated that an in-frame UGA opal nonsense codon directs the incorporation of selenocysteine. In the case of formate dehydrogenase incorporation occurs cotranslationally. Recently, we identified four genes whose products are required for selenocysteine incorporation in E. coli. We report here that one of these genes codes for a tRNA species with unique properties. It possesses an anticodon complementary to UGA and deviates in several positions from sequences, until now, considered invariant in all tRNA species. This tRNA is aminoacylated with L-serine by the seryl-tRNA ligase which also charges cognate tRNASer. Selenocysteine, therefore, is synthesized from a serine residue bound to a natural suppressor tRNA which recognizes UGA.
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) participates in many processes including early developmental events, angiogenesis, wound healing, and maintenance of neuronal cell viability. A 130-kilodalton protein was isolated on the basis of its ability to specifically bind to bFGF. A complementary DNA clone was isolated with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to determined amino acid sequences of tryptic peptide fragments of the purified protein. The putative bFGF receptor encoded by this complementary DNA is a transmembrane protein that contains three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, an unusual acidic region, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. These domains are arranged in a pattern that is different from that of any growth factor receptor described.
The refined crystal structure of Escherichia coli glutaminyl transfer RNA synthetase complexed with transfer RNA(Gln) and ATP reveals that the structure of the anticodon loop of the enzyme-bound tRNA(Gln) differs extensively from that of the known crystal structures of uncomplexed tRNA molecules. The anticodon stem is extended by two non-Watson-Crick base pairs, leaving the three anti-codon bases unpaired and splayed out to bind snugly into three separate complementary pockets in the protein. These interactions suggest that the entire anticodon loop provides essential sites for glutaminyl tRNA synthetase discrimination among tRNA molecules.
Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) is the founding member of a family of sterol-binding proteins implicated in vesicle transport, lipid metabolism, and signal transduction. Here, OSBP was found to function as a cholesterol-binding scaffolding protein coordinating the activity of two phosphatases to control the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Cytosolic OSBP formed a approximately 440-kilodalton oligomer with a member of the PTPPBS family of tyrosine phosphatases, the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A, and cholesterol. This oligomer had dual specific phosphatase activity for phosphorylated ERK (pERK). When cell cholesterol was lowered, the oligomer disassembled and the level of pERK rose. The oligomer also disassembled when exposed to oxysterols. Increasing the amount of OSBP oligomer rendered cells resistant to the effects of cholesterol depletion and decreased the basal level of pERK. Thus, cholesterol functions through its interaction with OSBP outside of membranes to regulate the assembly of an oligomeric phosphatase that controls a key signaling pathway in the cell.
Jurkat T cell lines constitutively expressing Tax, the 40-kilodalton transactivator protein of human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), were used to investigate the mechanism by which this viral product deregulates the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha gene (IL-2R alpha, Tac). Transfection of deleted forms of the IL-2R alpha promoter and in vitro DNA-binding studies revealed that a 12-base pair promoter segment, which has homology with the binding site for NF-kappa B, was required for Tax-induced activation of the IL-2R alpha promoter in vivo. An 18-base pair oligonucleotide containing this kappa B-like regulatory element proved sufficient to confer Tax inducibility upon a heterologous promoter. DNA affinity precipitation assays showed that Tax, like mitogenic stimuli, induced the expression of the 86-kilodalton cellular protein HIVEN86A, which specifically binds to the IL-2R alpha kappa B element in vitro. Furthermore, DNA/protein cross-linking studies revealed that several polypeptides interact with this sequence motif. Thus, the deregulation of IL-2R alpha gene expression encountered in HTLV-I leukemias appears to involve Tax activation of one or more cellular proteins that are normally induced by mitogens and that directly contribute to transcriptional activation of this receptor gene.
Cytosine deamination to uracil occurs frequently in cellular DNA. In vitro, RNA polymerase efficiently inserts adenine opposite to uracil, resulting in G to A base substitutions. In vivo, uracil could potentially alter transcriptional fidelity, resulting in production of mutant proteins. This study demonstrates that in nondividing Escherichia coli cells, a DNA template base replaced with uracil in a stop codon in the firefly luciferase gene results in conversion of inactive to active luciferase. The level of transcriptional base substitution is dependent on the capacity to repair uracil. These results provide evidence for a DNA damage-dependent, transcription-driven pathway for generating mutant proteins in nondividing cells.
Relaxin is a hormone important for the growth and remodeling of reproductive and other tissues during pregnancy. Although binding sites for relaxin are widely distributed, the nature of its receptor has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that two orphan heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors, LGR7 and LGR8, are capable of mediating the action of relaxin through an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent pathway distinct from that of the structurally related insulin and insulin-like growth factor family ligand. Treatment of antepartum mice with the soluble ligand-binding region of LGR7 caused parturition delay. The wide and divergent distribution of the two relaxin receptors implicates their roles in reproductive, brain, renal, cardiovascular, and other functions.
The x-ray crystal structure of recombinant human renin has been determined. Molecular dynamics techniques that included crystallographic data as a restraint were used to improve an initial model based on porcine pepsinogen. The present agreement factor for data from 8.0 to 2.5 angstroms (A) is 0.236. Some of the surface loops are poorly determined, and these disordered regions border a 30 A wide solvent channel. Comparison of renin with other aspartyl proteinases shows that, although the structural cores and active sites are highly conserved, surface residues, some of which are critical for specificity, vary greatly (up to 10A). Knowledge of the actual structure, as opposed to the use of models based on related enzymes, should facilitate the design of renin inhibitors.
The origin and functions of introns in protein coding genes is one of the enigmas of molecular biology. Splicing processes that remove intervening sequences from precursor RNAs must have either predated or co-evolved with introns. Inferences about the origin of introns and the possible modes of regulation of splicing should emerge from an understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of splicing. The biochemistry of splicing of tRNA and rRNA precursors has rapidly advanced with the development of in vitro reactions containing soluble components that duplicate in vivo reactions. We have recently shown that accurate splicing of an adenovirus mRNA precursor occurs during a coupled transcription/splicing reaction in a soluble whole cell extract. We now report that an exogenous RNA substrate containing the first and second leaders of adenovirus 2 is accurately spliced when added to an extract of HeLa cells. ATP and Mg2+ are essential cofactors for the reaction. The time course of splicing is unusual; a lag of 45 min is observed before the appearance of splicing product.
Kinetic studies for choline-O-acetyltransferase (CAT) (E.C. 2.3.1.6) and acetylcholinesterase (E.C. 3.1.1.7) were performed on serum, skin fibroblasts in culture, and biopsied sartorius muscle from normal and myasthenic subjects. There was a significant decrease of CAT activity per milligram of protein in myasthenic muscle compared to normal muscle, and there was no difference in acetylcholinesterase activity per milligram of protein in the same muscle homogenates. Substrate concentration curves for acetyl coenzyme A and CAT also showed a significant reduction in the maximum rate of product formation (V(max)) per milligram of protein between myasthenic and normal muscle. It is postulated that binding of substrate to CAT is being inhibited by an inhibitor present in muscle.
To make messenger RNA transcripts, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) undergoes a transition from an initiation phase, which only makes short RNA fragments, to a stable elongation phase. We have determined at 2.1 angstrom resolution the crystal structure of a T7 RNAP elongation complex with 30 base pairs of duplex DNA containing a "transcription bubble" interacting with a 17-nucleotide RNA transcript. The transition from an initiation to an elongation complex is accompanied by a major refolding of the amino-terminal 300 residues. This results in loss of the promoter binding site, facilitating promoter clearance, and creates a tunnel that surrounds the RNA transcript after it peels off a seven-base pair heteroduplex. Formation of the exit tunnel explains the enhanced processivity of the elongation complex. Downstream duplex DNA binds to the fingers domain, and its orientation relative to upstream DNA in the initiation complex implies an unwinding that could facilitate formation of the open promoter complex.
A human complementary DNA was isolated that encodes a widely expressed protein, hSos1, that is closely related to Sos, the product of the Drosophila son of sevenless gene. The hSos1 protein contains a region of significant sequence similarity to CDC25, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras from yeast. A fragment of hSos1 encoding the CDC25-related domain complemented loss of CDC25 function in yeast. This hSos1 domain specifically stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on mammalian Ras proteins in vitro. Mammalian cells overexpressing full-length hSos1 had increased guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Thus hSos1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. The hSos1 interacted with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) in vivo and in vitro. This interaction was mediated by the carboxyl-terminal domain of hSos1 and the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of GRB2. These results suggest that the coupling of receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras signaling is mediated by a molecular complex consisting of GRB2 and hSos1.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss in the developed world and has a strong genetic predisposition. A locus at human chromosome 10q26 affects the risk of AMD, but the precise gene(s) have not been identified. We genotyped 581 AMD cases and 309 normal controls in a Caucasian cohort in Utah. We demonstrate that a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs11200638, in the promoter region of HTRA1 is the most likely causal variant for AMD at 10q26 and is estimated to confer a population attributable risk of 49.3%. The HTRA1 gene encodes a secreted serine protease. Preliminary analysis of lymphocytes and retinal pigment epithelium from four AMD patients revealed that the risk allele was associated with elevated expression levels of HTRA1 mRNA and protein. We also found that drusen in the eyes of AMD patients were strongly immunolabeled with HTRA1 antibody. Together, these findings support a key role for HTRA1 in AMD susceptibility and identify a potential new pathway for AMD pathogenesis.
The discovery that breakdown products of cellular sphingolipids are biologically active has generated interest in the role of these molecules in cell physiology and pathology. Sphingolipid breakdown products, sphingosine and lysosphingolipids, inhibit protein kinase C, a pivotal enzyme in cell regulation and signal transduction. Sphingolipids and lysosphingolipids affect significant cellular responses and exhibit antitumor promoter activities in various mammalian cells. These molecules may function as endogenous modulators of cell function and possibly as second messengers.
Ion channels selectively permeable to chloride ions regulate cell functions as diverse as excitability and control of cell volume. Using expression cloning techniques, a complementary DNA from an epithelial cell line has been isolated, sequenced and its putative structure examined by site-directed mutagenesis. This cDNA, encoding a 235-amino-acid protein, gave rise to a chloride-selective outward current when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The expressed, outwardly rectifying chloride current was calcium-insensitive and was blocked by nucleotides applied to the cell surface. Mutation of a putative nucleotide-binding site resulted in loss of nucleotide block but incurred dependence on extracellular calcium concentration. The unusual sequence of this putative channel protein suggests a new class of ion channels not related to other previously cloned chloride channels.
Expression of the yeast his3 and other amino acid biosynthetic genes is induced during conditions of amino acid starvation. The coordination of this response is mediated by a positive regulatory protein called GCN4, which binds specifically to regulatory sites upstream of all coregulated genes and stimulates their transcription. The nucleotide sequence requirements of the his3 regulatory site were determined by analysis of numerous point mutations obtained by a novel method of cloning oligonucleotides. Almost all single base pair mutations within the nine base pair sequence ATGACTCTT significantly reduce his3 induction in vivo and GCN4 binding in vitro, whereas changes outside this region have minimal effects. One mutation, which generates a sequence that most closely resembles the consensus for 15 coregulated genes, increases both the level of induction and the affinity for GCN4 protein. The palindromic nature of the optimal sequence, ATGACTCAT, suggest that GCN4 protein binds as a dimer to adjacent half-sites that possibly overlap.
The packaging of intracellular DNA into heads is a key feature in the morphogenesis of bacteriophage particles. In many phages a performed empty head precursor, the prohead, is filled with DNA from a concatemeric substrate consisting of tandemly repeated genome lengths. The addition of outer shell proteins completes head formation. The DNA molecules released from particles of the coliphage T1 exist as three major permutations of nucleotide sequence. Such limited permutation can be explained by the modification of Streisinger's 'headful' mechanism proposed for phage P22. DNA packaging is initiated at a specific site (the pac site) on the concatemeric precursor. While this site is cleaved, subsequent cleavages (headful cleavages) are dependent only on head-filling and are not defined in terms of nucleotide sequence. Headfuls of DNA, consisting of slightly more than a genome length, are packaged in three successive cycles of head-filling to produce the permuted and terminally redundant molecules characteristic of T1 DNA. To elucidate the regulation of this process, we have studied the DNA metabolism of T1 head mutants. We describe here the properties of a mutant in gene 13.3 which is defective for headful cleavage but remains proficient in pac site cleavage. The observation in this mutant that concatemers are degraded to unit-length molecules by repeated pac site cleavage suggests a model of headful packaging in which pac site initiation and processive head-filling compete for the DNA substrate.
The rate of release of guanine nucleotides from the ras proteins (Ras) is extremely slow in the presence of Mg2+. It seemed likely, therefore that a factor might exist to accelerate the release of guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and hence the exchange of GDP for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Such a factor has now been discovered in rat brain cytosol. Brain cytosol was found to catalyze, by orders of magnitude, the release of guanine nucleotides from recombinant v-H-Ras protein bound with [alpha-32P]GDP. This effect occurred even in the presence of a large excess of Mg2+, but was destroyed by heat or by incubation of the cytosol for an hour at 37 degrees C in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. The effect was observed with either v-H-Ras or c-H-Ras, but not with p25rab3A, a small G protein with about 30% similarity to Ras. The effect could not be mimicked by addition of recombinant Ras-GAP or purified GEF, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in the regulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis. By gel filtration chromatography, the factor appears to possess a molecular size between 100,000 and 160,000 daltons. This protein (Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing factor, or Ras-GRF) may be involved in the activation of p21ras.
Respiratory complex I plays a central role in cellular energy production in bacteria and mitochondria. Its dysfunction is implicated in many human neurodegenerative diseases, as well as in aging. The crystal structure of the hydrophilic domain (peripheral arm) of complex I from Thermus thermophilus has been solved at 3.3 angstrom resolution. This subcomplex consists of eight subunits and contains all the redox centers of the enzyme, including nine iron-sulfur clusters. The primary electron acceptor, flavin-mononucleotide, is within electron transfer distance of cluster N3, leading to the main redox pathway, and of the distal cluster N1a, a possible antioxidant. The structure reveals new aspects of the mechanism and evolution of the enzyme. The terminal cluster N2 is coordinated, uniquely, by two consecutive cysteines. The novel subunit Nqo15 has a similar fold to the mitochondrial iron chaperone frataxin, and it may be involved in iron-sulfur cluster regeneration in the complex.
The alpha 1-adrenergic receptors activate a phospholipase C enzyme by coupling to members of the large molecular size (approximately 74 to 80 kilodaltons) G alpha h family of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins. Rat liver G alpha h is now shown to be a tissue transglutaminase type II (TGase II). The transglutaminase activity of rat liver TGase II expressed in COS-1 cells was inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) or by alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation. Rat liver TGase II also mediated alpha 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation of phospholipase C activity. Thus, G alpha h represents a new class of GTP-binding proteins that participate in receptor signaling and may be a component of a complex regulatory network in which receptor-stimulated GTP binding switches the function of G alpha h from transglutamination to receptor signaling.
A proteinase with high affinity for insulin has been proposed to play a role in the cellular processing of this hormone. A complementary DNA (cDNA) coding for this enzyme has been isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme contained the sequences of 13 peptides derived from the isolated protein. The cDNA could be transcribed in vitro to yield a synthetic RNA that in cell-free translations produced a protein that coelectrophoresed with the native proteinase and could be immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to this enzyme. The deduced sequence of this proteinase did not contain the consensus sequences for any of the known classes of proteinases (that is, metallo, cysteine, aspartic, or serine), but it did show homology to an Escherichia coli proteinase (called protease III), which also cleaves insulin and is present in the periplasmic space. Thus, these two proteins may be members of a family of proteases that are involved in intercellular peptide signaling.
Homozygous weaver mice are profoundly ataxic because of the loss of granule cell neurons during cerebellar development. This granule cell loss appears to be caused by a genetic defect in the pore region (Gly156-->Ser) of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (K+) channel subunit (GIRK2). A related subunit, GIRK1, associates with GIRK2 to constitute a neuronal G protein-gated inward rectifier K+ channel. The weaver allele of the GIRK2 subunit (wvGIRK2) caused loss of K+ selectivity when expressed either as wvGIRK2 homomultimers or as GIRK1-wvGIRK2 heteromultimers. The mutation also let to loss of sensitivity to G protein betagamma dimers. Expression of wvGIRK2 subunits let to increased cell death, presumably as a result of basal nonselective channel opening.
Several transfer RNAs (tRNAs) contain inosine (I) at the first position of their anticodon (position 34); this modification is thought to enlarge the codon recognition capacity during protein synthesis. The tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that forms I(34) in tRNAs is described. The heterodimeric enzyme consists of two sequence-related subunits (Tad2p/ADAT2 and Tad3p/ADAT3), both of which contain cytidine deaminase (CDA) motifs. Each subunit is encoded by an essential gene (TAD2 and TAD3), indicating that I(34) is an indispensable base modification in elongating tRNAs. These results provide an evolutionary link between the CDA superfamily and RNA-dependent adenosine deaminases (ADARs/ADATs).
The polypeptide encoded in URF6, the last unassigned reading frame of human mitochondrial DNA, has been identified with antibodies to peptides predicted from the DNA sequence. Antibodies prepared against highly purified respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase from beef heart or against the cytoplasmically synthesized 49-kilodalton iron-sulfur subunit isolated from this enzyme complex, when added to a deoxycholate or a Triton X-100 mitochondrial lysate of HeLa cells, specifically precipitated the URF6 product together with the six other URF products previously identified as subunits of NADH dehydrogenase. These results strongly point to the URF6 product as being another subunit of this enzyme complex. Thus, almost 60% of the protein coding capacity of mammalian mitochondrial DNA is utilized for the assembly of the first enzyme complex of the respiratory chain. The absence of such information in yeast mitochondrial DNA dramatizes the variability in gene content of different mitochondrial genomes.
When adenosine deaminase activity is inhibited, low concentrations of adenosine are toxic to human lymphoblast mutants that are unable to convert adenosine to intracellular nucleotides. In order to identify the mediator of this cytotoxicity, we searched for a cytoplasmic protein capable of binding adenosine with high affinity. Such a protein was identified in extracts of human lymphoblasts and placenta as the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase.
Transcription of messenger RNA-encoding genes in vitro requires many protein factors. Transcription factor IID, possibly with the cooperation of TFIIA, binds to the TATA element of the promoter, forming a complex that can bind TFIIB (refs 6, 7) followed by RNA polymerase II (refs 6, 8) and other factors. One or more of these steps is thought to be facilitated by gene-specific transcriptional activation proteins; this seems to require TFIID-associated auxiliary factors and may involve direct contact between the activator and TFIID and/or TFIIB. If such contact is necessary in vivo, activation might conceivably be blocked by a TFIIB derivative containing the sequences necessary for this interaction, but lacking those necessary for binding to the rest of the transcriptional apparatus, an effect similar to that referred to as squelching or transcriptional interference. Here we show that the activity of the glutamine-rich fushi tarazu activation domain is indeed blocked by truncated TFIIB derivatives in Drosophila Schneider L2 cells, suggesting that it is mediated by interactions with TFIIB.
ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K-ATP channels) couple cell metabolism to electrical activity and are important in the physiology and pathophysiology of many tissues. In pancreatic beta-cells, K-ATP channels link changes in blood glucose concentration to insulin secretion. They are also the target for clinically important drugs such as sulphonylureas, which stimulate secretion, and the K+ channel opener diazoxide, which inhibits insulin release. Metabolic regulation of K-ATP channels is mediated by changes in intracellular ATP and Mg-ADP levels, which inhibit and activate the channel, respectively. The beta-cell K-ATP channel is a complex of two proteins: an inward-rectifier K+ channel subunit, Kir6.2, and the sulphonylurea receptor, SUR1. We show here that the primary site at which ATP acts to mediate K-ATP channel inhibition is located on Kir6.2, and that SUR1 is required for sensitivity to sulphonylureas and diazoxide and for activation by Mg-ADP.
A bioassay that is based on trans-activation has been developed for the detection and quantitation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Indicator cell lines were constructed that contain the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Infection of these cells by HIV activates the expression of CAT protein. Isolates of HIV-1 with divergent nucleotide sequences activated the indicator cell lines to a similar extent, approximately 500- to 1000-fold. Human T cell lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2, equine infectious anemia virus, and herpes simplex virus 1 did not activate the indicator cell lines. Isolates of simian immunodeficiency virus and human T cell lymphotropic virus type 4 activated these cells to a much lesser extent, which suggests that these viruses contain similar, but distinct, trans-activators. This assay can be used for the detection, quantitation, and typing of HIV and for studying the effect of drugs on the replication of HIV in different cellular backgrounds.
Small molecules that affect specific protein functions can be valuable tools for dissecting complex cellular processes. Peptidoglycan synthesis and degradation is a process in bacteria that involves multiple enzymes under strict temporal and spatial regulation. We used a set of small molecules that inhibit the transglycosylation step of peptidoglycan synthesis to discover genes that help to regulate this process. We identified a gene responsible for the susceptibility of Escherichia coli cells to killing by glycolipid derivatives of vancomycin, thus establishing a genetic basis for activity differences between these compounds and vancomycin.
Fluorescence imaging is perhaps the most powerful technique currently available for continuously observing the dynamic intracellular biochemistry of single living cells. However, fluorescent indicator dyes have been available only for simple inorganic ions such as Ca2+, H+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Cl-. We now report a fluorescent indicator for the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) signalling pathway. The sensor consists of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in which the catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) subunits are each labelled with a different fluorescent dye such as fluorescein or rhodamine capable of fluorescence resonance energy transfer in the holoenzyme complex R2C2. When cAMP molecules bind to the R subunits, the C subunits dissociate, thereby eliminating energy transfer. The change in shape of the fluorescence emission spectrum allows cAMP concentrations and the activation of the kinase to be nondestructively visualized in single living cells microinjected with the labelled holoenzyme.
There are growing indications that the inherent curvature of DNA is important in protein-DNA recognition. The 10.5-base-pair (bp) periodicity of some dinucleotides first found in eukaryotic DNA sequences was interpreted as the expression of curvature of periodic segments of double-stranded DNA, the curvature resulting from co-orientation of periodically spaced 'wedges' between stacked base pairs. The wedge can be decomposed into roll and tilt components, opening towards a groove and a backbone respectively, both contributing to DNA curvature. The largest wedge was estimated to belong to the AA-TT dinucleotides. Recent work provided new experimental data on synthetic curved DNA. The authors tried to apply the wedge model to their results and met problems in doing so. We have found that taking into account both roll and tilt components of the AA-TT wedge, in the correct ratio, leads to remarkable consistency between the wedge model and the data.
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a ligand-dependent nuclear receptor that has been implicated in the modulation of critical aspects of development and homeostasis, including adipocyte differentiation, glucose metabolism and macrophage development and function. PPAR-gamma is activated by a range of synthetic and naturally occurring substances, including antidiabetic thiazolidinediones, polyunsaturated fatty acids, 15-deoxy-delta prostaglandin J2 and components of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, such as 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). However, the identities of endogenous ligands for PPAR-gamma and their means of production in vivo have not been established. In monocytes and macrophages, 13-HODE and 15-HETE can be generated from linoleic and arachidonic acids, respectively, by a 12/15-lipoxygenase that is upregulated by the TH2-derived cytokine interleukin-4. Here we show that interleukin-4 also induces the expression of PPAR-gamma and provide evidence that the coordinate induction of PPAR-gamma and 12/15-lipoxygenase mediates interleukin-4-dependent transcription of the CD36 gene in macrophages. These findings reveal a physiological role of 12/15-lipoxygenase in the generation of endogenous ligands for PPAR-gamma, and suggest a paradigm for the regulation of nuclear receptor function by cytokines.
The insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, is the most abundant facilitative glucose transporter in muscle and adipose tissue, the major sites for postprandial glucose disposal. To assess the role of GLUT4 in glucose homeostasis, we have disrupted the murine GLUT4 gene. Because GLUT4 has been shown to be dysregulated in pathological states such as diabetes and obesity, it was expected that genetic ablation of GLUT4 would result in abnormal glucose homeostasis. The mice deficient in GLUT4 (GLUT4-null) are growth-retarded and exhibit decreased longevity associated with cardiac hypertrophy and severely reduced adipose tissue deposits. Blood glucose levels in female GLUT4-null mice are not significantly elevated in either the fasting or fed state; in contrast, male GLUT4-null mice have moderately reduced glycaemias in the fasted state and increased glycaemias in the fed state. However, both female and male GLUT4-null mice exhibit postprandial hyperinsulinaemia, indicating possible insulin resistance. Increased expression of other glucose transporters is observed in the liver (GLUT2) and heart (GLUT1) but not skeletal muscle. Oral glucose tolerance tests show that both female and male GLUT4-null mice clear glucose as efficiently as controls, but insulin tolerance tests indicate that these mice are less sensitive to insulin action. The GLUT4-null mice demonstrate that functional GLUT4 protein is not required for maintaining nearly normal glycaemia but that GLUT4 is absolutely essential for sustained growth, normal cellular glucose and fat metabolism, and expected longevity.
The X-ray crystal structure of the subtilisin-type enzyme proteinase K at 1.5 A resolution shows that is has two binding sites for Ca2+. Scatchard analysis indicates that one Ca2+ binds tightly, with pK 7.6 x 10(-8) M-1, and the other only weakly. Although Ca2+ is not directly involved in the catalytic mechanism and is 16.6 A away from the alpha-carbon atoms of the catalytic triad Asp 39-His 69-Ser 224, the activity of proteinase K towards the synthetic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide drops slowly to approximately 20% of its original value when it is depleted of Ca2+. This is not due to autolysis of the enzyme. The X-ray crystal structure of Ca2+-free proteinase K shows that removal of Ca2+ from the tight binding site triggers a concerted domino-like movement of five peripheral loops and of two alpha-helices. At a distance of 25 A from this calcium-binding site, the geometry of both the secondary substrate binding site and of the catalytic triad is affected by this movement thereby reducing the activity of the enzyme.
Genetic selection was exploited in combination with structure-based design to transform an intimately entwined, dimeric chorismate mutase into a monomeric, four-helix-bundle protein with near native activity. Successful reengineering depended on choosing a thermostable starting protein, introducing point mutations that preferentially destabilize the wild-type dimer, and using directed evolution to optimize an inserted interhelical turn. Contrary to expectations based on studies of other four-helix-bundle proteins, only a small fraction of possible turn sequences (fewer than 0.05 percent) yielded well-behaved, monomeric, and highly active enzymes. Selection for catalytic function thus provides an efficient yet stringent method for rapidly assessing correctly folded polypeptides and may prove generally useful for protein design.
In contrast to most genomic DNA in mitotic cells, the promoter regions of some genes, such as the stress-inducible hsp70i gene that codes for a heat shock protein, remain uncompacted, a phenomenon called bookmarking. Here we show that hsp70i bookmarking is mediated by a transcription factor called HSF2, which binds this promoter in mitotic cells, recruits protein phosphatase 2A, and interacts with the CAP-G subunit of the condensin enzyme to promote efficient dephosphorylation and inactivation of condensin complexes in the vicinity, thereby preventing compaction at this site. Blocking HSF2-mediated bookmarking by HSF2 RNA interference decreases hsp70i induction and survival of stressed cells in the G1 phase, which demonstrates the biological importance of gene bookmarking.
Embryonic cell movement is essential for morphogenesis and the establishment of body shapes, but little is known about its mechanism. Here we report that pregnenolone, which is produced from cholesterol by the steroidogenic enzyme Cyp11a1 (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc), functions in promoting cell migration during epiboly. Epiboly is a process in which embryonic cells spread from the animal pole to cover the underlying yolk. During epiboly, cyp11a1 is expressed in an extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer. Reducing cyp11a1 expression in zebrafish using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides did not perturb cell fates, but caused epibolic delay. This epibolic defect was partially rescued by the injection of cyp11a1 RNA or the supplementation of pregnenolone. We show that the epibolic delay is accompanied by a decrease in the level of polymerized microtubules, and that pregnenolone can rescue this microtubule defect. Our results indicate that pregnenolone preserves microtubule abundance and promotes cell movement during epiboly.
Cell cycle-dependent histone genes are transcribed at a basal level throughout the cell cycle, with a three- to fivefold increase during early S phase. Protein-DNA interactions in the 5' promoter region of a cell cycle-regulated human H4 histone gene have been analyzed at single-nucleotide resolution in vivo. This region contains two sites, with four potential protein-binding domains, at which the DNA is protected from reaction with dimethyl sulfate in cells and from digestion with deoxyribonuclease I in nuclei. These protein-DNA interactions persist during all phases of the cell cycle and dissociate with 0.16 to 0.2M sodium chloride.
The primary defect in mice lacking the c-src gene is osteopetrosis, a deficiency in bone resorption by osteoclasts. Osteoclasts express high levels of the c-Src protein and the defect responsible for the osteopetrotic phenotype of the c-src-deficient (src-) mouse is cell-autonomous and occurs in mature osteoclasts. However, the specific signalling pathways that require c-Src expression for normal osteoclast activity have not been elucidated. We report here that the proto-oncogene product c-Cbl is tyrosine-phosphorylated in a Src-dependent manner in osteoclasts, where the two proteins colocalize on some vesicular structures. In vitro bone resorption by osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) is inhibited by both c-src and c-cbl antisense oligonucleotides. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the localization of c-Cbl-containing structures to the peripheral cytoskeleton are impaired in resorption-deficient c-src- OCLs, as well as in wild-type OCLs that have been treated with c-src antisense oligonucleotides. These results indicate that c-Cbl may act downstream of c-Src in a signalling pathway that is required for bone resorption.
Although bacteriophage T4 late promoters are selectively recognized by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase bearing a single protein encoded by T4 gene 55 (gp55), efficient transcription at these promoters requires enhancement by the three T4 DNA polymerase accessory proteins, bound to distal "mobile enhancer" sites. Two principles are shown to govern this transcriptional enhancement: (i) Promoter recognition and communication between the enhancer and the promoter require separate phage-coded proteins. Only RNA polymerase that has the T4 gene 33 protein (gp33) bound to it is subject to enhancement by the three DNA replication proteins. (ii) Transcriptional enhancement in this prokaryotic system is promoter-specific. Promoter specificity is generated by a direct competition of phage T4 gp33 and gp55 with the E. coli promoter recognition protein, sigma 70, for binding to the E. coli RNA polymerase core. Thus, polymerase that contains sigma 70 is competent to transcribe T4 early and middle genes, but lacks the ability to be enhanced by the DNA replication proteins, while polymerase that contains gp55 and gp33 is capable of enhancement via gp33, but its activity is restricted to T4 late promoters by gp55.
The Ras-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways by many receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) requires the activation of Src family tyrosine kinases. Stimulation of beta2 adrenergic receptors resulted in the assembly of a protein complex containing activated c-Src and the receptor. Src recruitment was mediated by beta-arrestin, which functions as an adapter protein, binding both c-Src and the agonist-occupied receptor. beta-Arrestin 1 mutants, impaired either in c-Src binding or in the ability to target receptors to clathrin-coated pits, acted as dominant negative inhibitors of beta2 adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of the MAP kinases Erk1 and Erk2. These data suggest that beta-arrestin binding, which terminates receptor-G protein coupling, also initiates a second wave of signal transduction in which the "desensitized" receptor functions as a critical structural component of a mitogenic signaling complex.
Human cells contain more than 60 small G proteins of the Rab family, which are localized to the surfaces of distinct membrane compartments and regulate transport vesicle formation, motility, docking and fusion. Prenylated Rabs also occur in the cytosol bound to GDI (guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor), which binds to Rabs in their inactive state. Prenyl Rab-GDI complexes contain all of the information necessary to direct Rab delivery onto distinct membrane compartments. The late endosomal, prenyl Rab9 binds GDI with very high affinity, which led us to propose that there might be a 'GDI-displacement factor' to catalyse dissociation of Rab-GDI complexes and to enable transfer of Rabs from GDI onto membranes. Indeed, we have previously shown that endosomal membranes contain a proteinaceous factor that can act in this manner. Here we show that the integral membrane protein, Yip3, acts catalytically to dissociate complexes of endosomal Rabs bound to GDI, and to deliver them onto membranes. We propose that the conserved Yip proteins serve as GDI-displacement factors for the targeting of Rab GTPases in eukaryotic cells.
Exchange of small molecules between cells through intercellular junctions is a widespread phenomenon implicated in many physiological and developmental processes. This type of intercellular communication can restore the activity of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in mammalian cells that are deficient in the enzyme UDP-Gal/UDP-GalNAc 4-epimerase. Pure cultures of the 4-epimerase mutant are unable to synthesize normal carbohydrate chains on LDL receptors and many other glycoproteins and therefore do not express LDL receptor activity. When these cells are cocultivated with cells expressing normal 4-epimerase activity, the structure and function of LDL receptors are restored to normal by the transfer of this enzyme's products through intercellular junctions. The formation of functional junctions does not require normal glycosylation of membrane proteins. Because many convenient assays and selections for LDL receptor activity are available, this mutant can provide a powerful new tool for biochemical and genetic studies of intercellular junctional communication.
Phosphorylation of ion channels has been suggested as one molecular mechanism responsible for learning-produced long-term changes in neuronal excitability. Persistent training-produced changes in two distinct K+ currents (IA (ref. 2), IK-Ca (refs 3,4)) and a voltage-dependent calcium current (ICa; refs 3,4) have previously been shown to occur in type B photoreceptors of Hermissenda, as a result of associative learning. But the identity of the phosphorylation pathway(s) responsible for these changes has not as yet been determined. Injections of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase reduce a K+ current (IK) in B cells which is different from those changed by training, but fails to reduce IA and IK-Ca. Phosphorylase b kinase (an exogenous calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase) reduces IA, but whether IK-Ca and ICa are changed in the manner of associative training is not yet known. Another protein kinase present in high concentrations in both mammalian brain and molluscan nervous systems is protein kinase C, which is both calcium- and phospholipid-sensitive. We now present evidence that activation of protein kinase C by the tumour promoter phorbol ester (PDB) and intracellular injection of the enzyme induce conductance changes similar to those caused by associative training in Hermissenda B cells (that is a reduction of IA and IK-Ca, and enhancement of ICa). These results represent the first direct demonstration that protein kinase C affects membrane K+ ion conductance mechanisms.
Investigation of vertebrate regulatory biology is restricted by the modest response amplitudes in mammalian model species that derive from a lifestyle of frequent small meals. By contrast, ambush-hunting snakes eat huge meals after long intervals. In juvenile pythons during feeding, there are large and rapid increases in metabolism and secretion, in the activation of enzymes and transporter proteins, and in tissue growth. These responses enable an economic hypothesis concerning the evolution of regulation to be tested. Combined with other experimental advantages, these features recommend juvenile pythons as the equivalent of a squid axon in vertebrate regulatory biology.
The recA protein mediates both genetic recombination and several cellular responses to DNA damage, including the induction of temperate bacteriophage. Indication of phage lambda results from proteolytic cleavage of lambda repressor directed by recA protein. We show here that this cleavage reaction requires both polynucleotide and ATP. We suggest that a stoichiometric complex of recA protein and DNA is active both to destroy repressors by proteolytic cleavage and to initiate pairing of this DNA to its homologous sequence in a DNA duplex ('strand invasion').
One approach to drug design involves determination of the structure of binding sites on target proteins to provide templates for ligand construction. Alternatively, random combinations of chemical groups can be used to generate diverse molecules for screening in the search for effective compounds. Here we report a strategy for developing potent ligands for proteins with multiple binding sites, which combines elements of both approaches: 'polymer-linked ligand dimers', in which two ligands are joined by a polymer chain of variable length. We find that polymer-linked ligand dimers containing two cyclic GMP moieties are up to a thousand times more potent than cyclic GMP in activating cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Each target protein responds optimally to a polymer-linked ligand dimer with a different average polymer length, even though their cyclic-nucleotide-binding sites are conserved. The tuning of polymer-linked ligand dimers indicates that each protein has a unique spacing of binding sites and provides an estimate of the distance between these sites. As optimal ligands are selected empirically, the polymer-linked ligand dimer strategy enables potent and selective agents to be identified without requiring previous structural information about the target proteins.
Double-stranded RNA viruses have an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity associated with the viral particles which is indispensable for their replication cycle. Using the yeast L-A double-stranded RNA virus we have investigated the mechanism by which the virus encapsidates its genomic RNA and RNA polymerase. The L-A gag gene encodes the principal viral coat protein and the overlapping pol gene is expressed as a gag-pol fusion protein which is formed by a -1 ribosomal frameshift. Here we show that Gag alone is sufficient for virus particle formation, but that it fails to package the viral single-stranded RNA genome. Encapsidation of the viral RNA requires only a part of the Pol region (the N-terminal quarter), which is presumably distinct from the RNA polymerase domain. Given that the Pol region has single-stranded RNA-binding activity, these results are consistent with our L-A virus encapsidation model: the Pol region of the fusion protein binds specifically to the viral genome (+) strand, and the N-terminal gag-encoded region primes polymerization of Gag to form the capsid, thus ensuring the packaging of both the viral genome and the RNA polymerase.
Tetrahydropapaveroline is a benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloidderivative of the biogenic amine, dopnmine. Alcohol, by way of its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, competitively inhibits nicotinamide-adenine Sinucleotide-linked aldehyde dehydrogenase and augments the formation of tetrahydropapaveroline in vitro. The limited capacity of brain to oxidize aldehydes may be of pharmacological importance because it facilitates the production of tetrahydropapaveroline in the presence of drugs which inhibit this enzyme.
Necrosis can be induced by stimulating death receptors with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or other agonists; however, the underlying mechanism differentiating necrosis from apoptosis is largely unknown. We identified the protein kinase receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) as a molecular switch between TNF-induced apoptosis and necrosis in NIH 3T3 cells and found that RIP3 was required for necrosis in other cells. RIP3 did not affect RIP1-mediated apoptosis but was required for RIP1-mediated necrosis and the enhancement of necrosis by the caspase inhibitor zVAD. By activating key enzymes of metabolic pathways, RIP3 regulates TNF-induced reactive oxygen species production, which partially accounts for RIP3's ability to promote necrosis. Our data suggest that modulation of energy metabolism in response to death stimuli has an important role in the choice between apoptosis and necrosis.
Reverse transcriptase activity of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was blocked in vitro by immunoglobulin G (IgG) derived from certain individuals infected with this retrovirus. A heterogeneous immune response for inhibition of enzyme function was noted. Catalytic activity was depressed by 50% or more with the use of 10 micrograms of IgG from 11 of 16 HIV-seropositive asymptomatic carriers, but from 0 of 8 seronegative controls and 2 of 12 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the AIDS-related complex (ARC). The inhibitor was confined to the F(ab')2 fragment. It was not directed against the poly(rA) X oligo(dT) template, nor against major envelope or structural viral antigens, and did not cross-react with bacterial, avian, or other mammalian DNA polymerases. It did not correlate with recognition of polymerase antigens by radioimmunoprecipitation. Loss of this inhibitor may be associated with development of clinical disease. Ten asymptomatic HIV-seropositive carriers with high titers of IgG antibodies to reverse transcriptase were followed for a mean of 3 years. All of four lost inhibitory capability prior to development of AIDS or ARC, while titers persist in the six who remain clinically healthy.
The reaper gene (rpr) is important for the activation of apoptosis in Drosophila. To investigate whether rpr expression is sufficient to induce apoptosis, transgenic flies were generated that express rpr complementary DNA or the rpr open reading frame in cells that normally live. Transcription of rpr from a heat-inducible promoter rapidly caused wide-spread ectopic apoptosis and organismal death. Ectopic overexpression of rpr in the developing retina resulted in eye ablation. The occurrence of cell death was highly sensitive to the dosage of the transgene. Because cell death induced by the protein encoded by rpr (RPR) could be blocked by the baculovirus p35 protein, RPR appears to activate a death program mediated by a ced-3/ICE (interleukin-1 converting enzyme)-like protease.
Activation of transcription initiation by the cI protein of phage lambda is thought to be mediated by a direct interaction between cl and RNA polymerase at the PRM promoter. Two negatively charged amino acid residues in the DNA binding domain of cI play a key role in activation, suggesting that these residues contact RNA polymerase. The subunit of RNA polymerase involved was identified by selecting polymerase mutants that restored the activation function of a mutant form of cI protein. Although previous studies suggest that several activators interact with the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase, the results here suggest that cI interacts with the sigma subunit. An arginine to histidine change near the carboxyl terminus of sigma specifically suppresses an aspartic acid to asparagine change in the activation region of cI. This finding supports the direct-contact model and suggests that a cluster of positively charged residues near the carboxyl terminus of sigma is the target of the negatively charged activation region of cI.
The poly(A) tail found on almost all eukaryotic messenger RNAs is important in enhancing translation initiation and determining mRNA stability. Control of poly(A)-tail synthesis thus has the potential to be a key regulatory step in gene expression and is indeed known to be important during early development in many organisms. To study a possible basis for such regulation, we examined phosphorylation of poly(A) polymerase (PAP) by p34(cdc2)/cyclin B (maturation/mitosis-promoting factor, MPF). We show here that PAP can be phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro by MPF. Consistent with this, PAP becomes hyperphosphorylated both during meiotic maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes and in HeLa cells arrested at M phase, times in the cell-cycle when MPF is known to be active. We show further that hyperphosphorylation by MPF dramatically reduces the activity of purified PAP, and that PAP isolated from mitotic HeLa cells is similarly inhibited by hyperphosphorylation. This repression probably contributes to the well established reductions in poly(A)+ RNA and/or protein synthesis known to occur in M-phase cells.
Rice fields are a global source of the greenhouse gas methane, which is produced by methanogenic archaea, and by methanogens of Rice Cluster I (RC-I) in particular. RC-I methanogens are not yet available in pure culture, and the mechanistic reasons for their prevalence in rice fields are unknown. We reconstructed a complete RC-I genome (3.18 megabases) using a metagenomic approach. Sequence analysis demonstrated an aerotolerant, H2/CO2-dependent lifestyle and enzymatic capacities for carbohydrate metabolism and assimilatory sulfate reduction, hitherto unknown among methanogens. These capacities and a unique set of antioxidant enzymes and DNA repair mechanisms as well as oxygen-insensitive enzymes provide RC-I with a selective advantage over other methanogens in its habitats, thereby explaining the prevalence of RC-I methanogens in the rice rhizosphere.
The enzymes p70s6k and p85s6k are two isoforms of the same kinase and are important in mitogenesis. Both isoforms are activated by a complex phosphorylation event and lie on a common signalling pathway, distinct from that of the p42mapk/p44mapk kinases. Activation of p42mapk/p44mapk is triggered by sequential activation of the GDP-GTP exchange factor Sos, the GTP-binding protein p21ras, and protein kinases p74raf and p47mek (refs 7-10). As p21ras transformed cells have increased S6 phosphorylation, we tested whether the p70s6k/p85s6k signalling pathway bifurcates between p21ras and p42mapk/p44mapk. We found that mutants of p74raf and p21ras blocked activation of epitope-tagged p44mapk but not epitope-tagged p70s6k. Moreover, in cells expressing human platelet-derived growth factor receptors lacking the kinase-insert domain, the growth factor activates p21ras but not p70s6k/p85s6k. The critical autophosphorylation site for p70s6k/p85s6k activation within this domain is a tyrosine at residue 751. Our results show that the p70s6k/p85s6k signalling pathway is independent of p21ras, that it bifurcates from the p21ras pathway at the receptor, and that it is initiated by autophosphorylation at a specific site.
Arginine-repressed cells of Escherichia coli W do not form a protein immunologically related to ornithine transcarbamylase. This was determined by lack of cross-reactivity of repressed cell extracts with rabbit antisera prepared against purified ornithine transcarbamylase. The results indicate that arginine acts by blocking the synthesis of the entire enzyme-protein.
Regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity by kinases and phosphatases contributes to the modulation of synaptic transmission. Targeting of these enzymes near the substrate is proposed to enhance phosphorylation-dependent modulation. Yotiao, an NMDA receptor-associated protein, bound the type I protein phosphatase (PP1) and the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) holoenzyme. Anchored PP1 was active, limiting channel activity, whereas PKA activation overcame constitutive PP1 activity and conferred rapid enhancement of NMDA receptor currents. Hence, yotiao is a scaffold protein that physically attaches PP1 and PKA to NMDA receptors to regulate channel activity.
A water-soluble peridinin-chlorophyll-protein complex from the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra was found to have a molecular weight of about 38,000. The complex could be disrupted by digestion with proteolytic enzymes. No electron transfer was observed when the complex was irradiated.
The conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone by steroid 5 alpha-reductase is a key reaction in androgen action, and is essential both for the formation of the male phenotype during embryogenesis and for androgen-mediated growth of tissues such as the prostate. Single gene defects that impair this conversion lead to pseudohermaphroditism in which 46X,Y males have male internal urogenital tracts, but female external genitalia. We have described the isolation of a human 5 alpha-reductase complementary DNA from prostate. Subsequent cloning and genetic studies showed that this gene (designated 5 alpha-reductase 1) was normal in patients with 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. We report here the isolation of a second 5 alpha-reductase cDNA by expression cloning and the polymerase chain reaction. The biochemical and pharmacological properties of this cDNA-encoded enzyme (designated 5 alpha-reductase 2) are consistent with it being the major isozyme in genital tissue. A deletion in this gene is present in two related individuals with male pseudohermaphroditism caused by 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. These results verify the existence of at least two 5 alpha-reductases in man and provide insight into a fundamental hormone-mediated event in male sexual differentiation.
Structural studies of antibiotics not only provide a shortcut to medicine allowing for rational structure-based drug design, but may also capture snapshots of dynamic intermediates that become 'frozen' after inhibitor binding. Myxopyronin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) by an unknown mechanism. Here we report the structure of dMyx--a desmethyl derivative of myxopyronin B--complexed with a Thermus thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme. The antibiotic binds to a pocket deep inside the RNAP clamp head domain, which interacts with the DNA template in the transcription bubble. Notably, binding of dMyx stabilizes refolding of the beta'-subunit switch-2 segment, resulting in a configuration that might indirectly compromise binding to, or directly clash with, the melted template DNA strand. Consistently, footprinting data show that the antibiotic binding does not prevent nucleation of the promoter DNA melting but instead blocks its propagation towards the active site. Myxopyronins are thus, to our knowledge, a first structurally characterized class of antibiotics that target formation of the pre-catalytic transcription initiation complex-the decisive step in gene expression control. Notably, mutations designed in switch-2 mimic the dMyx effects on promoter complexes in the absence of antibiotic. Overall, our results indicate a plausible mechanism of the dMyx action and a stepwise pathway of open complex formation in which core enzyme mediates the final stage of DNA melting near the transcription start site, and that switch-2 might act as a molecular checkpoint for DNA loading in response to regulatory signals or antibiotics. The universally conserved switch-2 may have the same role in all multisubunit RNAPs.
Dopamine receptors are classified into D1 and D2 subtypes on the basis of their pharmacological and biochemical characteristics. The D2 dopamine receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of movement disorders, schizophrenia and drug addiction. The D2 dopamine receptor interacts with guanine nucleotide-binding proteins to induce second messenger systems. Other members of the family of receptors that are coupled to G proteins share a significant similarity in primary amino-acid sequence and exhibit an archetypical topology predicted to consist of seven putative transmembrane domains. We have taken advantage of the expected nucleotide sequence similarities among members of this gene family to isolate genes coding for new receptors. Using the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor gene as a hybridization probe we have isolated related genes including a cDNA encoding the rat D2 dopamine receptor. This receptor has been characterized on the basis of three criteria: the deduced amino-acid sequence which reveals that it is a member of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors; the tissue distribution of the mRNA which parallels that of the D2 dopamine receptor; and the pharmacological profile of mouse fibroblast cells transfected with the cDNA.
Orderly progression through the somatic cell division cycle is accompanied by phase-specific transcription of a variety of different genes. During S phase, transcription of mammalian histone H2B genes requires a specific promoter element and its cognate transcription factor Oct1 (OTF1). A possible mechanism for regulating histone H2B transcription during the cell cycle is direct modulation of Oct1 activity by phase-specific posttranslational modifications. Analysis of Oct1 during progression through the cell cycle revealed a complex temporal program of phosphorylation. A p34cdc2-related protein kinase that is active during mitosis may be responsible for one mitotic phosphorylation of Oct1. However, the temporally controlled appearance of Oct1 phosphopeptides suggests the involvement of multiple kinases and phosphatases. These results support the idea that cell cycle-regulated transcription factors may be direct substrates for phase-specific regulatory enzymes.
Microorganisms and plants manufacture a large collection of medically and commercially useful natural products called polyketides by a process that resembles fatty acid biosynthesis. Genetically engineered microorganisms with modified polyketide synthase (PKS) genes can produce new metabolites that may have new or improved pharmacological activity. A potentially general method to prepare cell-free systems for studying bacterial type II PKS enzymes has been developed that facilitates the purification and reconstitution of their constituent proteins. Selective expression of different combinations of the Streptomyces glaucescens tetracenomycin (Tcm) tcmJKLMN genes in a tcmGHIJKLMNO null background has been used to show that the Tcm PKS consists of at least the TcmKLMN proteins. Addition of the TcmJ protein to the latter four enzymes resulted in a greater than fourfold increase of overall activity and thus represents the optimal Tcm PKS. Polyclonal antibodies raised against each of the TcmKLMN proteins strongly inhibit the Tcm PKS, as do known inhibitors targeted to the active site Cys and Ser residues of a fatty acid synthase. This system exhibits a strict starter unit specificity because neither propionyl, butyryl, or isobutyryl coenzyme A substitute for acetyl coenzyme A in assembly of the Tcm decaketide. Because the Tcm PKS activity is significantly diminished by removal of the TcmM acyl carrier protein and can be restored by addition of separately purified TcmM to two different types of TcmM-deficient PKS, it should be possible to use such preparations to assay for each of the constituents of the Tcm PKS.
Thermodynamic calculations showed that the autotrophic synthesis of all 20 protein-forming amino acids was energetically favored in hot (100 degrees C), moderately reduced, submarine hydrothermal solutions relative to the synthesis in cold (18 degrees C), oxidized, surface seawater. The net synthesis reactions of 11 amino acids were exergonic in the hydrothermal solution, but all were endergonic in surface seawater. The synthesis of the requisite amino acids of nine thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins in a 100 degreesC hydrothermal solution yielded between 600 and 8000 kilojoules per mole of protein, which is energy that is available to drive the intracellular synthesis of enzymes and other biopolymers in hyperthermophiles thriving in these ecosystems.
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a high frequency of skin cancer on sun-exposed areas, and neurological complications. XP has a defect in the early step(s) of nucleotide-excision repair (NER) and consists of eight different genetic complementation groups (groups A-G and a variant). We established XPA (group-A XP) gene-deficient mice by gene targeting of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The XPA-deficient mice showed neither obvious physical abnormalities nor pathological alterations, but were defective in NER and highly susceptible to ultraviolet-B- or 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz[a]anthracene-induced skin carcinogenesis. These findings provide in vivo evidence that the XPA protein protects mice from carcinogenesis initiated by ultraviolet or chemical carcinogen. The XPA-deficient mice may provide a good in vivo model to study the high incidence of skin carcinogenesis in group A XP patients.
The gene that is defective in patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy consists of about 60 short exons scattered along a gigantic DNA region that spans some 2 megabase pairs. The encoded protein, dystrophin, was recently characterized as a component of muscle intracellular membranes of low abundance. The dystrophin messenger RNA is difficult to study in both normal and pathological tissue specimens because it is large (14 kilobases) and scarce (0.01-0.001% of total muscle mRNA). We report here that efficient in vitro co-amplifications of the mRNAs of the dystrophin gene and of a reporter gene, aldolase A, by the polymerase chain reaction procedure enables us to obtain a quantitative estimate of the dystrophin gene transcript. A processed, transcribed segment was thus detected in 13 different human tissues. It ranged from 0.02-0.12% of total mRNA in skeletal muscle to 25,000 times less in lymphoblastoid cells.
The elongation of RNA chains during transcription occurs in a ternary complex containing RNA polymerase (RNAP), DNA template, and nascent RNA. It is shown here that elongating RNAP from Escherichia coli can switch DNA templates by means of end-to-end transposition without loss of the transcript. After the switch, transcription continues on the new template. With the use of defined short DNA fragments as switching templates, RNAP-DNA interactions were dissected into two spatially distinct components, each contributing to the stability of the elongating complex. The front (F) interaction occurs ahead of the growing end of RNA. This interaction is non-ionic and requires 7 to 9 base pairs of intact DNA duplex. The rear (R) interaction is ionic and requires approximately six nucleotides of the template DNA strand behind the active site and one nucleotide ahead of it. The nontemplate strand is not involved. With the use of protein-DNA crosslinking, the F interaction was mapped to the conserved zinc finger motif in the NH2-terminus of the beta' subunit and the R interaction, to the COOH-terminal catalytic domain of the beta subunit. Mutational disruption of the zinc finger selectively destroyed the F interaction and produced a salt-sensitive ternary complex with diminished processivity. A model of the ternary complex is proposed here that suggests that trilateral contacts in the active center maintain the nonprocessive complex, whereas a front-end domain including the zinc finger ensures processivity.
Vegetative cells of Clostridium botulinum were shown to contain iron-sulfur proteins that react with added nitrite to form iron-nitric oxide complexes, with resultant destruction of the iron-sulfur cluster. Inactivation of iron-sulfur enzymes (especially ferredoxin) by binding of nitric oxide would almost certainly inhibit growth, and thus is probably the mechanism of botulinal inhibition by nitrite in foods.
Cross-linking of the antigen receptor on lymphocytes by antigens or antibodies to the receptor results in activation of enzymes of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the gene encoding the PKC-betaI and PKC-betaII isoforms develop an immunodeficiency characterized by impaired humoral immune responses and reduced cellular responses of B cells, which is similar to X-linked immunodeficiency in mice. Thus PKC-betaI and PKC-betaII play an important role in B cell activation and may be functionally linked to Bruton's tyrosine kinase in antigen receptor-mediated signal transduction.
The role of calcium ions (Ca2+) in cell function is beginning to be unraveled at the molecular level as a result of recent research on calcium-binding proteins and particularly on calmodulin. These proteins interact reversibly with Ca2+ to form a protein . Ca2+ complex, whose activity is regulated by the cellular flux of Ca2+. Many of the effects of Ca2+ appear to be exerted through calmodulin-regulated enzymes.
The molybdenum cofactor is part of the active site of all molybdenum-dependent enzymes, except nitrogenase. The molybdenum cofactor consists of molybdopterin, a phosphorylated pyranopterin, with an ene-dithiolate coordinating molybdenum. The same pyranopterin-based cofactor is involved in metal coordination of the homologous tungsten-containing enzymes found in archea. The molybdenum cofactor is synthesized by a highly conserved biosynthetic pathway. In plants, the multidomain protein Cnx1 catalyses the insertion of molybdenum into molybdopterin. The Cnx1 G domain (Cnx1G), whose crystal structure has been determined in its apo form, binds molybdopterin with high affinity and participates in the catalysis of molybdenum insertion. Here we present two high-resolution crystal structures of Cnx1G in complex with molybdopterin and with adenylated molybdopterin (molybdopterin-AMP), a mechanistically important intermediate. Molybdopterin-AMP is the reaction product of Cnx1G and is subsequently processed in a magnesium-dependent reaction by the amino-terminal E domain of Cnx1 to yield active molybdenum cofactor. The unexpected identification of copper bound to the molybdopterin dithiolate sulphurs in both structures, coupled with the observed copper inhibition of Cnx1G activity, provides a molecular link between molybdenum and copper metabolism.
Eukaryotic cells use multiple, highly conserved mechanisms to contend with ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage. One important response mechanism is transcription-coupled repair (TCR), during which DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of an active gene are repaired much faster than in the genome overall. In mammalian cells, defective TCR gives rise to the severe human disorder Cockayne's syndrome (CS). The best-studied CS gene, CSB, codes for a Swi/Snf-like DNA-dependent ATPase, whose yeast homologue is called Rad26 (ref. 4). Here we identify a yeast protein, termed Def1, which forms a complex with Rad26 in chromatin. The phenotypes of cells lacking DEF1 are consistent with a role for this factor in the DNA damage response, but Def1 is not required for TCR. Rather, def1 cells are compromised for transcript elongation, and are unable to degrade RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in response to DNA damage. Our data suggest that RNAPII stalled at a DNA lesion triggers a coordinated rescue mechanism that requires the Rad26-Def1 complex, and that Def1 enables ubiquitination and proteolysis of RNAPII when the lesion cannot be rapidly removed by Rad26-promoted DNA repair.
Membrane phosphoinositides control a variety of cellular processes through the recruitment and/or regulation of cytosolic proteins. One mechanism ensuring spatial specificity in phosphoinositide signalling is the targeting of enzymes that mediate their metabolism to specific subcellular sites. Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type 1 gamma (PtdInsPKI gamma) is a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase that is expressed at high levels in brain, and is concentrated at synapses. Here we show that the predominant brain splice variant of PtdInsPKI gamma (PtdInsPKI gamma-90) binds, by means of a short carboxy-terminal peptide, to the FERM domain of talin, and is strongly activated by this interaction. Talin, a principal component of focal adhesion plaques, is also present at synapses. PtdInsPKI gamma-90 is expressed in non-neuronal cells, albeit at much lower levels than in neurons, and is concentrated at focal adhesion plaques, where phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate has an important regulatory role. Overexpression of PtdInsPKI gamma-90, or expression of its C-terminal domain, disrupts focal adhesion plaques, probably by local disruption of normal phosphoinositide balance. These findings define an interaction that has a regulatory role in cell adhesion and suggest new similarities between molecular interactions underlying synaptic junctions and general mechanisms of cell adhesion.
A method is presented for the isolation of filaments of 90-angstrom diameter from the white matter of bovine brain by first floating the myelinated axons in a centrifugal field and then fractionating the axons on a series of density gradients. This results in a fraction that contains two types of bundles of filaments but few other constituents. The filaments are stable over a wide range of temperatures and at both low and high ionic strength. Their density and their resistance to digestion by ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease indicate that they are primarily protein. The molecular weight of the subunit is approximately 60,000. The protein does not comigrate with microtubule protein and does not bind cholcicine or nucleotides.
Common copy number variations (CNVs) represent a significant source of genetic diversity, yet their influence on phenotypic variability, including disease susceptibility, remains poorly understood. To address this problem in human cancer, we performed a genome-wide association study of CNVs in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma, a disease in which single nucleotide polymorphism variations are known to influence susceptibility. We first genotyped 846 Caucasian neuroblastoma patients and 803 healthy Caucasian controls at approximately 550,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and performed a CNV-based test for association. We then replicated significant observations in two independent sample sets comprised of a total of 595 cases and 3,357 controls. Here we describe the identification of a common CNV at chromosome 1q21.1 associated with neuroblastoma in the discovery set, which was confirmed in both replication sets. This CNV was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, fluorescent in situ hybridization and analysis of matched tumour specimens, and was shown to be heritable in an independent set of 713 cancer-free parent-offspring trios. We identified a previously unknown transcript within the CNV that showed high sequence similarity to several neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) genes and represents a new member of this gene family (NBPF23). This transcript was preferentially expressed in fetal brain and fetal sympathetic nervous tissues, and the expression level was strictly correlated with CNV state in neuroblastoma cells. These data demonstrate that inherited copy number variation at 1q21.1 is associated with neuroblastoma and implicate a previously unknown neuroblastoma breakpoint family gene in early tumorigenesis of this childhood cancer.
Almost half of all enzymes must associate with a particular metal to function. An ambition is to understand why each metal-protein partnership arose and how it is maintained. Metal availability provides part of the explanation, and has changed over geological time and varies between habitats but is held within vital limits in cells. Such homeostasis needs metal sensors, and there is an ongoing search to discover the metal-sensing mechanisms. For metalloproteins to acquire the right metals, metal sensors must correctly distinguish between the inorganic elements.
The genome sequences of certain archaea do not contain recognizable cysteinyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases, which are essential for messenger RNA-encoded protein synthesis. However, a single cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase activity was detected and purified from one such organism, Methanococcus jannaschii. The amino-terminal sequence of this protein corresponded to the predicted sequence of prolyl-tRNA synthetase. Biochemical and genetic analyses indicated that this archaeal form of prolyl-tRNA synthetase can synthesize both cysteinyl-tRNA(Cys) and prolyl-tRNA(Pro). The ability of one enzyme to provide two aminoacyl-tRNAs for protein synthesis raises questions about concepts of substrate specificity in protein synthesis and may provide insights into the evolutionary origins of this process.
There is now good evidence that cytoplasmic pH (pHi) may have an important role in the metabolic activation of quiescent cells. In particular, growth stimulation of mammalian fibroblasts leads to a rapid increase in pHi (refs 3-6), due to activation of a Na+/H+ exchanger in the plasma membrane, and this alkalinization is necessary for the initiation of DNA synthesis. However, the mechanism by which mitogens activate the Na+/H+ exchanger to raise pHi is not known, although an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) has been postulated as the primary trigger. We now present data suggesting that the Na+/H+ exchanger is set in motion through protein kinase C, a phospholipid- and Ca2+-dependent enzyme normally activated by diacylglycerol produced from inositol phospholipids in response to external stimuli. Using newly developed pH microelectrodes and fluorimetric techniques, we show that a tumour promoting phorbol ester and synthetic diacylglycerol, both potent activators of kinase C (refs 12-15), mimic the action of mitogens in rapidly elevating pHi in different cell types. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, contrary to previous views, an early rise in [Ca2+]i is not essential for the activation of Na+/H+ exchange and the resultant increase in pHi. Finally, we suggest that an alkaline pHi shift, mediated by Na+/H+ exchange, may be a common signal in the action of those hormones which elicit the breakdown of inositol phospholipids.
Prions are the infectious agents responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The principal component of prions is the glycoprotein PrP(Sc), which is a conformationally modified isoform of a normal cell-surface protein called PrP(C) (ref. 1). During the time between infection and the appearance of the clinical symptoms, minute amounts of PrP(Sc) replicate by conversion of host PrP(C), generating large amounts of PrP(Sc) aggregates in the brains of diseased individuals. We aimed to reproduce this event in vitro. Here we report a procedure involving cyclic amplification of protein misfolding that allows a rapid conversion of large excess PrP(C) into a protease-resistant, PrP(Sc)-like form in the presence of minute quantities of PrP(Sc) template. In this procedure, conceptually analogous to polymerase chain reaction cycling, aggregates formed when PrP(Sc) is incubated with PrP(C) are disrupted by sonication to generate multiple smaller units for the continued formation of new PrP(Sc). After cyclic amplification more than 97% of the protease-resistant PrP present in the sample corresponds to newly converted protein. The method could be applied to diagnose the presence of currently undetectable prion infectious agent in tissues and biological fluids, and may provide a unique opportunity to determine whether PrP(Sc) replication results in the generation of infectivity in vitro.
Using the atomic structures of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui and its complexes with two substrate analogs, we establish that the ribosome is a ribozyme and address the catalytic properties of its all-RNA active site. Both substrate analogs are contacted exclusively by conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) residues from domain V of 23S rRNA; there are no protein side-chain atoms closer than about 18 angstroms to the peptide bond being synthesized. The mechanism of peptide bond synthesis appears to resemble the reverse of the acylation step in serine proteases, with the base of A2486 (A2451 in Escherichia coli) playing the same general base role as histidine-57 in chymotrypsin. The unusual pK(a) (where K(a) is the acid dissociation constant) required for A2486 to perform this function may derive in part from its hydrogen bonding to G2482 (G2447 in E. coli), which also interacts with a buried phosphate that could stabilize unusual tautomers of these two bases. The polypeptide exit tunnel is largely formed by RNA but has significant contributions from proteins L4, L22, and L39e, and its exit is encircled by proteins L19, L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e.
Damage to DNA in the cell activates the tumour-suppressor protein p53, and failure of this activation leads to genetic instability and a predisposition to cancer. It is therefore crucial to understand the signal transduction mechanisms that connect DNA damage with p53 activation. The enzyme known as DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) has been proposed to be an essential activator of p53, but the evidence for its involvement in this pathway is controversial. We now show that the p53 response is fully functional in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking DNA-PK: irradiation-induced DNA damage in these defective fibroblasts induces a normal response of p53 accumulation, phosphorylation of a p53 serine residue at position 15, nuclear localization and binding to DNA of p53. The upregulation of p53-target genes and cell-cycle arrest also occur normally. The DNA-PK-deficient cell line SCGR11 contains a homozygous mutation in the DNA-binding domain of p53, which may explain the defective response by p53 reported in this line. Our results indicate that DNA-PK activity is not required for cells to mount a p53-dependent response to DNA damage.
Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates alpha-tubulin in assembled microtubules. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 promotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. Our results show that HDAC6 is the tubulin deacetylase, and provide evidence that reversible acetylation regulates important biological processes beyond histone metabolism and gene transcription.
Members of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors associate with myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as MyoD to activate skeletal myogenesis. MEF2 proteins also interact with the class II histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5, resulting in repression of MEF2-dependent genes. Execution of the muscle differentiation program requires release of MEF2 from repression by HDACs, which are expressed constitutively in myoblasts and myotubes. Here we show that HDAC5 shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm when myoblasts are triggered to differentiate. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) signalling, which stimulates myogenesis and prevents formation of MEF2-HDAC complexes, also induces nuclear export of HDAC4 and HDAC5 by phosphorylation of these transcriptional repressors. An HDAC5 mutant lacking two CaMK phosphorylation sites is resistant to CaMK-mediated nuclear export and acts as a dominant inhibitor of skeletal myogenesis, whereas a cytoplasmic HDAC5 mutant is unable to block efficiently the muscle differentiation program. Our results highlight a mechanism for transcriptional regulation through signal- and differentiation-dependent nuclear export of a chromatin-remodelling enzyme, and suggest that nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of HDACs is involved in the control of cellular differentiation.
Dynein, an ATPase, is the force-generating protein in cilia and flagella. It has long been speculated that cytoplasmic microtubules contain a related enzyme involved in cell division or in intracellular organelle transport. A 'cytoplasmic dynein' has been described in sea urchin eggs, but because the egg stockpiles precursors for both cytoplasmic and ciliary microtubules, the role of this enzyme in the cell has remained unresolved. We recently found that the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1C (ref. 6) from brain is a microtubule-activated ATPase that produces force in the direction corresponding to retrograde organelle transport in the cell. MAP 1C has several similar properties to ciliary and flagellar dynein. Here we show directly, using scanning transmission electron microscopy, that MAP 1C is structurally equivalent to the ciliary and flagellar enzyme and is the long-sought cytoplasmic analogue of this enzyme.
The respiratory tract epithelium of dogs, from the nose to the lungs, was examined for cytochrome P-450 and associated biotransformation activities. In the ethmoturbinates, where olfactory epithelium is located, the amount of cytochrome P-450 was comparable to that in the liver, when measured on the basis of activity per milligram of microsomal protein. The rest of the nasal region also contained large quantities of cytochrome P-450. The presence of these enzymes in the nose may be important in chemical-induced tumorigenesis. The nasal carcinogen hexamethyl-phosphoramide was shown to be metabolized by nasal microsomal enzymes to another nasal carcinogen, formaldehyde.
Eukaryotic chromosomes are organized inside the nucleus in such a way that only a subset of the genome is expressed in any given cell type, but the details of this organization are largely unknown. SATB1 ('special AT-rich sequence binding 1'), a protein found predominantly in thymocytes, regulates genes by folding chromatin into loop domains, tethering specialized DNA elements to an SATB1 network structure. Ablation of SATB1 by gene targeting results in temporal and spatial mis-expression of numerous genes and arrested T-cell development, suggesting that SATB1 is a cell-type specific global gene regulator. Here we show that SATB1 targets chromatin remodelling to the IL-2Ralpha ('interleukin-2 receptor alpha') gene, which is ectopically transcribed in SATB1 null thymocytes. SATB1 recruits the histone deacetylase contained in the NURD chromatin remodelling complex to a SATB1-bound site in the IL-2Ralpha locus, and mediates the specific deacetylation of histones in a large domain within the locus. SATB1 also targets ACF1 and ISWI, subunits of CHRAC and ACF nucleosome mobilizing complexes, to this specific site and regulates nucleosome positioning over seven kilobases. SATB1 defines a class of transcriptional regulators that function as a 'landing platform' for several chromatin remodelling enzymes and hence regulate large chromatin domains.
Superfamily 1 and superfamily 2 RNA helicases are ubiquitous messenger-RNA-protein complex (mRNP) remodelling enzymes that have critical roles in all aspects of RNA metabolism. The superfamily 2 DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 (human DDX19) functions in mRNA export and is thought to remodel mRNPs at the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Dbp5 is localized to the NPC via an interaction with Nup159 (NUP214 in vertebrates) and is locally activated there by Gle1 together with the small-molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). Local activation of Dbp5 at the NPC by Gle1 is essential for mRNA export in vivo; however, the mechanistic role of Dbp5 in mRNP export is poorly understood and it is not known how Gle1(InsP6) and Nup159 regulate the activity of Dbp5. Here we report, from yeast, structures of Dbp5 in complex with Gle1(InsP6), Nup159/Gle1(InsP6) and RNA. These structures reveal that InsP(6) functions as a small-molecule tether for the Gle1-Dbp5 interaction. Surprisingly, the Gle1(InsP6)-Dbp5 complex is structurally similar to another DEAD-box ATPase complex essential for translation initiation, eIF4G-eIF4A, and we demonstrate that Gle1(InsP6) and eIF4G both activate their DEAD-box partner by stimulating RNA release. Furthermore, Gle1(InsP6) relieves Dbp5 autoregulation and cooperates with Nup159 in stabilizing an open Dbp5 intermediate that precludes RNA binding. These findings explain how Gle1(InsP6), Nup159 and Dbp5 collaborate in mRNA export and provide a general mechanism for DEAD-box ATPase regulation by Gle1/eIF4G-like activators.
Nucleotide-excision repair (NER) is an important cellular defence mechanism against mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. The essential yeast genes RAD3 (ref. 2) and SSL2 (RAD25), homologues of the human xeroderma pigmentosum genes XPD and XPB respectively, have been implicated in NER in yeast. The products of these genes are also subunits of (Rad3 protein) or associate with (Ssl2 protein) purified yeast RNA polymerase II transcription initiation factor b, the counterpart of human TFIIH. Rad3 and Ssl2 proteins may participate directly in NER. Alternatively, they may function exclusively as transcription factors that support NER by influencing the expression of other NER genes. Here we show that defective NER in rad3 mutant extracts can be specifically complemented by purified transcription factor b. Similarly, defective NER in ssl2 mutant extracts is corrected by purified factor b/Ssl2 complex. These results support a direct role of factor b during NER in yeast. Hence, factor b (TFIIH) has a dual role in transcription and NER.
Selective protein kinase inhibitors were developed on the basis of the unexpected binding mode of 2,6,9-trisubstituted purines to the adenosine triphosphate-binding site of the human cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). By iterating chemical library synthesis and biological screening, potent inhibitors of the human CDK2-cyclin A kinase complex and of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc28p were identified. The structural basis for the binding affinity and selectivity was determined by analysis of a three-dimensional crystal structure of a CDK2-inhibitor complex. The cellular effects of these compounds were characterized in mammalian cells and yeast. In the latter case the effects were characterized on a genome-wide scale by monitoring changes in messenger RNA levels in treated cells with high-density oligonucleotide probe arrays. Purine libraries could provide useful tools for analyzing a variety of signaling and regulatory pathways and may lead to the development of new therapeutics.
The coordinated and reciprocal action of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinases and phosphatases produces transient phosphorylation, a fundamental regulatory mechanism for many biological processes. The human genome encodes a far greater number of Ser/Thr protein kinases than of phosphatases. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), in particular, is ubiquitously distributed and regulates a broad range of cellular functions, including glycogen metabolism, cell-cycle progression and muscle relaxation. PP1 has evolved effective catalytic machinery but lacks substrate specificity. Substrate specificity is conferred upon PP1 through interactions with a large number of regulatory subunits. The regulatory subunits are generally unrelated, but most possess the RVxF motif, a canonical PP1-binding sequence. Here we reveal the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the complex between PP1 and a 34-kDa N-terminal domain of the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1. MYPT1 is the protein that regulates PP1 function in smooth muscle relaxation. Structural elements amino- and carboxy-terminal to the RVxF motif of MYPT1 are positioned in a way that leads to a pronounced reshaping of the catalytic cleft of PP1, contributing to the increased myosin specificity of this complex. The structure has general implications for the control of PP1 activity by other regulatory subunits.
Myocardial infarction (MI) has become one of the leading causes of death in the world. Its pathogenesis includes chronic formation of plaque inside the vessel wall of the coronary artery and acute rupture of the artery, implicating a number of inflammation-mediating molecules, such as the cytokine lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA). Functional variations in LTA are associated with susceptibility to MI. Here we show that LTA protein binds to galectin-2, a member of the galactose-binding lectin family. Our case-control association study in a Japanese population showed that a single nucleotide polymorphism in LGALS2 encoding galectin-2 is significantly associated with susceptibility to MI. This genetic substitution affects the transcriptional level of galectin-2 in vitro, potentially leading to altered secretion of LTA, which would then affect the degree of inflammation; however, its relevance to other populations remains to be clarified. Smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the human atherosclerotic lesions expressed both galectin-2 and LTA. Our findings thus suggest a link between the LTA cascade and the pathogenesis of MI.
beta-Arrestins, originally discovered in the context of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization, also function in internalization and signaling of these receptors. We identified c-Jun amino-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) as a binding partner of beta-arrestin 2 using a yeast two-hybrid screen and by coimmunoprecipitation from mouse brain extracts or cotransfected COS-7 cells. The upstream JNK activators apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4 were also found in complex with beta-arrestin 2. Cellular transfection of beta-arrestin 2 caused cytosolic retention of JNK3 and enhanced JNK3 phosphorylation stimulated by ASK1. Moreover, stimulation of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor activated JNK3 and triggered the colocalization of beta-arrestin 2 and active JNK3 to intracellular vesicles. Thus, beta-arrestin 2 acts as a scaffold protein, which brings the spatial distribution and activity of this MAPK module under the control of a GPCR.
Staufen 1 (STAU1)-mediated messenger RNA decay (SMD) involves the degradation of translationally active mRNAs whose 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTRs) bind to STAU1, a protein that binds to double-stranded RNA. Earlier studies defined the STAU1-binding site within ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) mRNA as a 19-base-pair stem with a 100-nucleotide apex. However, we were unable to identify comparable structures in the 3' UTRs of other targets of SMD. Here we show that STAU1-binding sites can be formed by imperfect base-pairing between an Alu element in the 3' UTR of an SMD target and another Alu element in a cytoplasmic, polyadenylated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). An individual lncRNA can downregulate a subset of SMD targets, and distinct lncRNAs can downregulate the same SMD target. These are previously unappreciated functions of non-coding RNAs and Alu elements. Not all mRNAs that contain an Alu element in the 3' UTR are targeted for SMD even in the presence of a complementary lncRNA that targets other mRNAs for SMD. Most known trans-acting RNA effectors consist of fewer than 200 nucleotides, and these include small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs. Our finding that the binding of STAU1 to mRNAs can be transactivated by lncRNAs uncovers an unexpected strategy that cells use to recruit proteins to mRNAs and mediate the decay of these mRNAs. We name these lncRNAs half-STAU1-binding site RNAs (1/2-sbsRNAs).
Spinach fraction I protein (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxy genase, E.C. 4.1.1.39) was crystallized on both an analytical and a preparative scale by vapor diffusion with polyethylene glycol (molecular weight, 6000) used as the precipitant. The identity of the crystalline material with fraction I protein was shown by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and immunological properties. The carboxylase and oxygenase activities copurify during crystallization, and the crystalline enzyme lacks copper and iron.
Brain RNA polymerase isolated from rats treated with pemoline and magnesium hydroxide (Cylert) was not more active than enzyme from control animals. The drug did not increase enzymic activity in vitro. Pemoline did not significantly affect either RNA or protein synthesis in suspensions of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells.
The Ras proteins are key regulators of the growth of eukaryotic cells, but their direct target enzymes, or 'effectors', are unknown. The protein encoded by the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene is thought to function downstream of p21ras because disruption of Raf blocks signalling by Ras in a number of systems. Here we report that the amino-terminal cysteine-rich regulatory region of p74c-raf-1 expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein binds directly to Ras with relatively high affinity (50 nM). The binding is strictly dependent on the Ras protein being in the active GTP-bound conformation rather than the inactive GDP-bound state. Raf-GST interacts with wild-type and oncogenic Ras (Val 12) but fails to interact with a biologically inert effector mutant of Ras (Ala 38) and a dominant negative mutant (Asn 17). A peptide based on the effector region of Ras inhibits the interaction. Raf-GST acts as a potent competitive inhibitor of the GTPase-activating proteins p120GAP and neurofibromin. In addition, Raf itself displays weak GTPase-stimulating activity towards Ras. It is therefore likely that Raf is a direct effector of Ras.
The HLA-A and -B antigens, encoded in the major histocompatibility complex, are transmembrane proteins whose carboxy termini project inwards from the cell membrane. The intracellular region of the HLA-B7 antigen is known to include two glutamine residues. We have used guinea pig transglutaminase to show that in vitro the enzyme couples amines specifically to glutamine residues in the carboxy-terminal region of the HLA-B7 and -A2 antigens. The specificity of this reaction has an immediate practical significance, but may also have a wider biological interest.
The minimal promoter elements required for initiation by RNA polymerase II include the TATA box and/or an initiator element (Inr) at or near the transcription start site. Studies of the adenovirus major late core promoter (containing both elements) have demonstrated an initiation pathway that involves binding of the transcription factor TFIID (or the derived subunit, the TATA-binding protein TBP (TFIID tau)) to the TATA element, which is facilitated by transcription factor TFIIA, followed by sequential interactions of other general factors. Here we describe a novel pathway that requires an intact Inr and the Inr-binding factor TFII-I (ref. 3). Sequential addition of the general factors generated TFII-I-dependent preinitiation complexes different from those formed with TFIIA. Furthermore, TBP bound cooperatively (with only TFII-I) to an Inr-containing TATA-less promoter, suggesting a means for activation of TATA-less promoters, which nonetheless require TFIID (refs 9-11). These observations provide support for functionally distinct pathways which could be subject to differential regulation by specific activators or repressors.
The sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) family of transcription activators are critical regulators of cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. We previously demonstrated that human SREBPs bind the CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 acetyltransferase KIX domain and recruit activator-recruited co-factor (ARC)/Mediator co-activator complexes through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that SREBPs use the evolutionarily conserved ARC105 (also called MED15) subunit to activate target genes. Structural analysis of the SREBP-binding domain in ARC105 by NMR revealed a three-helix bundle with marked similarity to the CBP/p300 KIX domain. In contrast to SREBPs, the CREB and c-Myb activators do not bind the ARC105 KIX domain, although they interact with the CBP KIX domain, revealing a surprising specificity among structurally related activator-binding domains. The Caenorhabditis elegans SREBP homologue SBP-1 promotes fatty acid homeostasis by regulating the expression of lipogenic enzymes. We found that, like SBP-1, the C. elegans ARC105 homologue MDT-15 is required for fatty acid homeostasis, and show that both SBP-1 and MDT-15 control transcription of genes governing desaturation of stearic acid to oleic acid. Notably, dietary addition of oleic acid significantly rescued various defects of nematodes targeted with RNA interference against sbp-1 and mdt-15, including impaired intestinal fat storage, infertility, decreased size and slow locomotion, suggesting that regulation of oleic acid levels represents a physiologically critical function of SBP-1 and MDT-15. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ARC105 is a key effector of SREBP-dependent gene regulation and control of lipid homeostasis in metazoans.
By means of a thermodynamic perturbation method implemented with molecular dynamics, the relative free energy of binding was calculated for the enzyme thermolysin complexed with a pair of phosphonamidate and phosphonate ester inhibitors. The calculated difference in free energy of binding was 4.21 +/- 0.54 kilocalories per mole. This compares well with the experimental value of 4.1 kilocalories per mole. The method is general and can be used to determine a change or "mutation" in any system that can be suitably represented. It is likely to prove useful for protein and drug design.
A DNA sequence for the genome of bacteriophage phi X174 of approximately 5,375 nucleotides has been determined using the rapid and simple 'plus and minus' method. The sequence identifies many of the features responsible for the production of the proteins of the nine known genes of the organism, including initiation and termination sites for the proteins and RNAs. Two pairs of genes are coded by the same region of DNA using different reading frames.
Dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS) has long been regarded as a catalytic marvel because of its ability to perform several consecutive chemical reactions in one active site. There has been considerable debate as to whether DHQS is actively involved in all these steps, or whether several steps occur spontaneously, making DHQS a spectator in its own mechanism. DHQS performs the second step in the shikimate pathway, which is required for the synthesis of aromatic compounds in bacteria, microbial eukaryotes and plants. This enzyme is a potential target for new antifungal and antibacterial drugs as the shikimate pathway is absent from mammals and DHQS is required for pathogen virulence. Here we report the crystal structure of DHQS, which has several unexpected features, including a previously unobserved mode for NAD+-binding and an active-site organization that is surprisingly similar to that of alcohol dehydrogenase, in a new protein fold. The structure reveals interactions between the active site and a substrate-analogue inhibitor, which indicate how DHQS can perform multistep catalysis without the formation of unwanted by-products.
Peptidoglycan is the major structural constituent of the bacterial cell wall, forming a meshwork outside the cytoplasmic membrane that maintains cell shape and prevents lysis. In Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan is located in the periplasm, where it is protected from exogenous lytic enzymes by the outer membrane. Here we show that the type VI secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa breaches this barrier to deliver two effector proteins, Tse1 and Tse3, to the periplasm of recipient cells. In this compartment, the effectors hydrolyse peptidoglycan, thereby providing a fitness advantage for P. aeruginosa cells in competition with other bacteria. To protect itself from lysis by Tse1 and Tse3, P. aeruginosa uses specific periplasmically localized immunity proteins. The requirement for these immunity proteins depends on intercellular self-intoxication through an active type VI secretion system, indicating a mechanism for export whereby effectors do not access donor cell periplasm in transit.
The critical viral components for packaging DNA, recognizing and binding to host cells, and injecting the condensed DNA into the host are organized at a single vertex of many icosahedral viruses. These component structures do not share icosahedral symmetry and cannot be resolved using a conventional icosahedral averaging method. Here we report the structure of the entire infectious Salmonella bacteriophage epsilon15 (ref. 1) determined from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, without icosahedral averaging. This structure displays not only the icosahedral shell of 60 hexamers and 11 pentamers, but also the non-icosahedral components at one pentameric vertex. The densities at this vertex can be identified as the 12-subunit portal complex sandwiched between an internal cylindrical core and an external tail hub connecting to six projecting trimeric tailspikes. The viral genome is packed as coaxial coils in at least three outer layers with approximately 90 terminal nucleotides extending through the protein core and the portal complex and poised for injection. The shell protein from icosahedral reconstruction at higher resolution exhibits a similar fold to that of other double-stranded DNA viruses including herpesvirus, suggesting a common ancestor among these diverse viruses. The image reconstruction approach should be applicable to studying other biological nanomachines with components of mixed symmetries.
A group of proteins anchored to the cell by phosphatidylinositol (PI) has recently been identified. The significance of this new class of membrane anchor is unknown; one possibility is that it facilitates release of the molecule by phospholipases. In fact, phospholipase C enzymes specific for the complex carboxyl-terminal glycolipids of these proteins have been isolated from African trypanosomes and from hepatocyte plasma membranes. This study reports the discovery of a glycan-PI-specific phospholipase D in human serum that cleaves both the membrane form of the variant surface glycoprotein of African trypanosomes and its glycolipid precursor, but not phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidylinositol. Decay-accelerating factor, another PI-anchored molecule, is also cleaved by the enzyme and converted from a hydrophobic to a soluble protein. The enzyme is Ca2+-dependent, heat labile, and not affected by the inhibitor of serine proteases, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Its function is not known, but the present findings indicate that it participates in the metabolism of glycolipid-anchored membrane proteins.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NADPH oxidase function as defence and signalling molecules related to innate immunity and various cellular responses. The activation of NADPH oxidase in response to plasma membrane receptor activation depends on the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic oxidase subunits, their translocation to membranes and the assembly of all NADPH oxidase components. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a prominent stimulus of ROS production, but the molecular mechanisms by which TNF activates NADPH oxidase are poorly understood. Here we identify riboflavin kinase (RFK, formerly known as flavokinase) as a previously unrecognized TNF-receptor-1 (TNFR1)-binding protein that physically and functionally couples TNFR1 to NADPH oxidase. In mouse and human cells, RFK binds to both the TNFR1-death domain and to p22(phox), the common subunit of NADPH oxidase isoforms. RFK-mediated bridging of TNFR1 and p22(phox) is a prerequisite for TNF-induced but not for Toll-like-receptor-induced ROS production. Exogenous flavin mononucleotide or FAD was able to substitute fully for TNF stimulation of NADPH oxidase in RFK-deficient cells. RFK is rate-limiting in the synthesis of FAD, an essential prosthetic group of NADPH oxidase. The results suggest that TNF, through the activation of RFK, enhances the incorporation of FAD in NADPH oxidase enzymes, a critical step for the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase.
The slow inward Ca2+ current, ICa, is fundamental in the initiation of cardiac contraction and neurohormonal regulation of cardiac function. It is increased by beta-adrenergic agonists, which stimulate synthesis of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine reduces ICa by an unknown mechanism. There is strong evidence that acetylcholine reduces ICa by decreasing adenylate cyclase activity, but cGMP has also been implicated as ACh stimulates cGMP accumulation and activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Application of cGMP decreases contractile force, decreases Ca flux, shortens the duration of action potentials and inhibits Ca-dependent action potentials. Other studies, however, have concluded that cGMP levels do not correlate with contractile force and that cGMP has no effect on ICa. We have therefore examined the effects of intracellular perfusion of cGMP on ICa using isolated, voltage-clamped cells from frog ventricle. We find that cGMP has negligible effects on basal ICa, but greatly decreases the ICa that had been elevated by beta-adrenergic agonists or by intracellular perfusion with cAMP. The decrease of ICa is mediated by cAMP hydrolysis via a cGMP-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase.
Double-stranded RNA, made as an intermediary substance in the replication of most, if not all, viruses, may play a much more important role in the pathogenesis and the recovery from virus infections than has hitherto been suspected. Apparently, dsRNA is used by both the challenge virus and the host cell in an attempt to gain "molecular control." Double-stranded RNA exerts a set of effects, which may be well balanced, not only at the level of the individual cell but also at the complex assemblage of these cells termed the organism (Fig. 1). In the cell, interferon synthesis is triggered, although interferon mRNA translation may not occur if dsRNA shuts off protein synthesis too quickly. In the whole organism, the disease severity will depend on how certain toxic reactions evoked by infection (such as cell necrosis and fever) are counterbalanced by an increase in the host defense mechanisms (for example, immune responsiveness and interferon production). Many aspects of the response, relating to either progress of, or recovery from, the disease, can be explained on the basis of a dsRNA. In addition to drawing attention to the biodynamic role of dsRNA, our hypothesis suggests specific experimental vectors designed to enhance our information on the molecular basis of the morbid process which occurs with viral infection. Finally, we suggest that, although the dsRNA molecule may be viewed as a rather simple unit structure, the opportunity for further diversity in the biological activity of a given dsRNA molecule always exists. Namely, each deviation from a perfectly double-helical arrangement introduces the possibility for emphasizing one biological reactivity at the expense of another. This latter structure-activity property may partially account for the extreme apparent diversity, commonly encountered, in the presentations of virologic illness. Appendix note added in proof. Subsequent to submission of this text, we have found that the potent mitogen effect of dsRNA for lymphocytes (murine and human) is also exquisitively sensitive to the fidelity in base pairing of the input polymer pair (59). For example, infrequent "loops" (one nucleotide per 20 base pairs) in an otherwise perfectly helical rI(n) (.) rC(n) molecule [for example, rI(n) (.) r(C(19,)U)(n)] strongly changes its mitogenic properties. This observation, which supports our thesis that a "fine structure" term can be developed for other reactions triggered by dsRNA's in biological systems, emphasizes that diverse biological effects may be encountered with an ostensibly uniform family of dsRNA's.
Small G proteins switch from a resting, GDP-bound state to an active, GTP-bound state. As spontaneous GDP release is slow, guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) are required to promote fast activation of small G proteins through replacement of GDP with GTP in vivo. Families of GEFs with no sequence similarity to other GEF families have now been assigned to most families of small G proteins. In the case of the small G protein Arf1, the exchange of bound GDP for GTP promotes the coating of secretory vesicles in Golgi traffic. An exchange factor for human Arf1, ARNO, and two closely related proteins, named cytohesin 1 and GPS1, have been identified. These three proteins are modular proteins with an amino-terminal coiled-coil, a central Sec7-like domain and a carboxy-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. The Sec7 domain contains the exchange-factor activity. It was first found in Sec7, a yeast protein involved in secretion, and is present in several other proteins, including the yeast exchange factors for Arf, Geal and Gea2. Here we report the crystal structure of the Sec7 domain of human ARNO at 2 A resolution and the identification of the site of interaction of ARNO with Arf.
The D and L forms of the enzyme HIV-1 protease have been prepared by total chemical synthesis. The two proteins had identical covalent structures. However, the folded protein-enzyme enantiomers showed reciprocal chiral specificity on peptide substrates. That is, each enzyme enantiomer cut only the corresponding substrate enantiomer. Reciprocal chiral specificity was also evident in the effect of enantiomeric inhibitors. These data imply that the folded forms of the chemically synthesized D- and L-enzyme molecules are mirror images of one another in all elements of the three-dimensional structure. Enantiomeric proteins are expected to display reciprocal chiral specificity in all aspects of their biochemical interactions.
To explore neuronal mechanisms underlying long-term consequences of stress, we studied stress-induced changes in the neuritic translocation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) splice variants. Under normal conditions, we found the synaptic AChE-S mRNA and protein in neurites. Corticosterone, anticholinesterases, and forced swim, each facilitated a rapid (minutes), yet long-lasting (weeks), shift from AChE-S to the normally rare AChE-R mRNA, promoted AChE-R mRNA translocation into neurites, and induced enzyme secretion. Weeks after stress, electrophysiological measurements in hippocampus slices displayed apparently normal evoked synaptic responses but extreme hypersensitivity to both anticholinesterases and atropine. Our findings suggest that neuronal hypersensitivity under stress involves neuritic replacement of AChE-S with AChE-R.
Attention has focused on the regulation of the eucaryotic cell division cycle since the protein kinase p34cdc2 was identified as a key enzyme in mitotic induction. The level of this kinase remains constant throughout the cell cycle but its activity alters, particularly before M phase. Although the factors regulating cdc2 activity are still unknown, there is increasing evidence that it is influenced by p34cdc2 dephosphorylation. Protein phosphatase inhibitor-2 (I2) is a specific inhibitor of phosphatase type-1, which with type-2A is one of the two principal Ser(P) and Thr(P) phosphatases. Here we show that the level of I2, assayed by immunofluorescence staining, activity measurements, western immunoblotting and metabolic labelling, oscillates during the cell cycle in rat fibroblasts, peaking at S phase and mitosis. Moreover, when we inhibited I2 in vivo by microinjection of anti-I2 antibodies in S-phase cells, the pseudo-mitotic cellular response to injected p34cdc2 was restored, indicating that I2 might have a role in the modulation of p34cdc2 activity.
Iron must cross biological membranes to reach essential intracellular enzymes. Two proteins in the plasma membrane of yeast--a multicopper oxidase, encoded by the FET3 gene, and a permease, encoded by the FTR1 gene--were shown to mediate high-affinity iron uptake. FET3 expression was required for FTR1 protein to be transported to the plasma membrane. FTR1 expression was required for apo-FET3 protein to be loaded with copper and thus acquire oxidase activity. FTR1 protein also played a direct role in iron transport. Mutations in a conserved sequence motif of FTR1 specifically blocked iron transport.
The division cycle of eukaryotic cells is regulated by a family of protein kinases known as the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The sequential activation of individual members of this family and their consequent phosphorylation of critical substrates promotes orderly progression through the cell cycle. The complexes formed by CDK4 and the D-type cyclins have been strongly implicated in the control of cell proliferation during the G1 phase. CDK4 exists, in part, as a multi-protein complex with a D-type cyclin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and a protein, p21 (refs 7-9). CDK4 associates separately with a protein of M(r) 16K, particularly in cells lacking a functional retinoblastoma protein. Here we report the isolation of a human p16 complementary DNA and demonstrate that p16 binds to CDK4 and inhibits the catalytic activity of the CDK4/cyclin D enzymes. p16 seems to act in a regulatory feedback circuit with CDK4, D-type cyclins and retinoblastoma protein.
Many lines of evidence suggest that mitochondria have a central role in ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria are critical regulators of cell death, a key feature of neurodegeneration. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA and oxidative stress both contribute to ageing, which is the greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. In all major examples of these diseases there is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early and acts causally in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, an impressive number of disease-specific proteins interact with mitochondria. Thus, therapies targeting basic mitochondrial processes, such as energy metabolism or free-radical generation, or specific interactions of disease-related proteins with mitochondria, hold great promise.
Prochlorophytes are prokaryotes that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis using chlorophylls a and b, but lack phycobiliproteins as light-harvesting pigments. These characteristics distinguish them from cyanobacteria, which contain phycobiliproteins, but no chlorophyll b. Three prochlorophyte genera have been described: Prochloron, Prochlorothrix and Prochlorococcus. The prochlorophytes share their pigment characteristics with green plant and euglenoid chloroplasts, which has led to a debate on whether these chloroplasts may have arisen from an endosymbiotic prochlorophyte rather than a cyanobacterium. Molecular sequence data, including those presented here based on a fragment of the rpoC1 gene encoding a subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, indicate that the known prochlorophyte lineages do not include the direct ancestor of chloroplasts. We also show that the prochlorophytes are a highly diverged polyphyletic group. Thus the use of chlorophyll b as a light-harvesting pigment has developed independently several times in evolution. Similar conclusions have been reached in parallel studies using 16S ribosomal RNA sequences.
Jasmonate and salicylate are plant-produced signals that activate plant defence genes after herbivory or pathogen attack. Amplification of these signals, evoked by either enemy attack or experimental manipulation, leads to an increase in the synthesis of toxic compounds (allelochemicals) and defence proteins in the plants. Although the jasmonate and salicylate signal cascades activate different sets of plant defence genes, or even act antagonistically, there is substantial communication between the pathways. Jasmonate and salicylate also contribute to protecting plants against herbivores by causing plants that experience insect damage to increase their production of volatile molecules that attract natural enemies of herbivorous insects. In response to plant defences, herbivores increase their production of enzymes that detoxify allelochemicals, including cytochrome P450s (refs 15, 16). But herbivores are potentially vulnerable to toxic allelochemicals in the duration between ingesting toxins and induction of detoxification systems. Here we show that the corn earworm Helicoverpa zea uses jasmonate and salicylate to activate four of its cytochrome P450 genes that are associated with detoxification either before or concomitantly with the biosynthesis of allelochemicals. This ability to 'eavesdrop' on plant defence signals protects H. zea against toxins produced by host plants.
Transcription requires that RNA polymerase binds to promoters buried in nonspecific sites on DNA. The search for promoters may be facilitated if the polymerase slides along the molecule of DNA. Single molecules of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase were visualized, and their movements on immobilized bacteriophage lambda and T7 DNAs were examined. Deviating from drifts by bulk flow, about 40 percent of the enzyme molecules moved along the extended DNA. The results provide direct evidence for sliding as a mechanism for relocation of the enzyme on DNA.
Activation of protein synthesis is required for quiescent cells to transit the cell cycle, and seems to be mediated in part by phosphorylation of the 40S ribosomal protein, S6. A mitogen-activated S6 kinase of relative molecular mass 70,000 (70K) has been isolated from mouse fibroblasts as well as from avian, rat and rabbit tissues. Comparison of complementary DNA sequences shows that this enzyme is distinct from S6 kinase II (92K) found in Xenopus eggs and fibroblasts. Both kinases are activated by serine/threonine phosphorylation, suggesting that at least one serine/threonine kinase links receptor tyrosine kinases with S6 kinases. A candidate for this link is MAP2 kinase, which is rapidly activated by tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation following mitogenic stimulation. Incubation of MAP2 kinase from insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with phosphatase-inactivated S6 kinase II from Xenopus leads to partial reactivation and phosphorylation of the enzyme. These and other findings have led to the suggestion that MAP2 kinase also activates the 70K S6 kinase. Here we refute this idea by showing that the two kinases lie on distinct signalling pathways.
Many tyrosine kinases, including the receptors for hormones such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor and insulin, transmit intracellular signals through Ras proteins. Ligand binding to such receptors stimulates Ras guanine-nucleotide-exchange activity and increases the level of GTP-bound Ras, suggesting that these tyrosine kinases may activate a guanine-nucleotide releasing protein (GNRP). In Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, genetic studies have shown that Ras activation by tyrosine kinases requires the protein Sem-5/drk, which contains a single Src-homology (SH) 2 domain and two flanking SH3 domains. Sem-5 is homologous to the mammalian protein Grb2, which binds the autophosphorylated EGF receptor and other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins such as Shc through its SH2 domain. Here we show that in rodent fibroblasts, the SH3 domains of Grb2 are bound to the proline-rich carboxy-terminal tail of mSos1, a protein homologous to Drosophila Sos. Sos is required for Ras signalling and contains a central domain related to known Ras-GNRPs. EGF stimulation induces binding of the Grb2-mSos1 complex to the autophosphorylated EGF receptor, and mSos1 phosphorylation. Grb2 therefore appears to link tyrosine kinases to a Ras-GNRP in mammalian cells.
The steady state of histone acetylation is established and maintained by multiple histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases, and this steady state affects chromatin structure and function. The identification of a maize complementary DNA encoding the chromatin-bound deacetylase HD2 is reported. This protein was not homologous to the yeast RPD3 transcriptional regulator. It was expressed throughout embryo germination in correlation with the proliferative activity of cells. Antibodies against recombinant HD2-p39 immunoprecipitated the native enzyme complex, which was composed of phosphorylated p39 subunits. Immunofluorescence microscopy and sequence homologies suggested nucleolar localization. HD2 is an acidic nucleolar phosphoprotein that might regulate ribosomal chromatin structure and function.
DAP kinase is a new type of calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme that phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on proteins. Its structure contains ankyrin repeats and the 'death' domain, and it is associated with the cell cytoskeleton. The gene encoding DAP kinase was initially isolated as a positive mediator of apoptosis induced by interferon-gamma, by using a strategy of functional cloning. We have now tested whether this gene has tumour-suppressive activity. We found that lung carcinoma clones, characterized by their highly aggressive metastatic behaviour and originating from two independent murine lung tumours, did not express DAP kinase, in contrast to their low-metastatic counterparts. Restoration of DAP kinase to physiological levels in high-metastatic Lewis carcinoma cells suppressed their ability to form lung metastases after intravenous injection into syngeneic mice, and delayed local tumour growth in a foreign 'microenvironment' Conversely, in vivo selection of rare lung lesions following injection into syngeneic mice of low-metastatic Lewis carcinoma cells or of DAP kinase transfectants, was associated with loss of DAP kinase expression. In situ TUNEL staining of tumour sections revealed that DAP kinase expression from the transgene raised the incidence of apoptosis in vivo. DAP-kinase transfectants also showed increased sensitivity in vitro to apoptotic stimuli, of the sort encountered by metastasizing cells at different stages of malignancy. We propose that loss of DAP kinase expression provides a unique mechanism that links suppression of apoptosis to metastasis.
As more genomes are sequenced, the identification and characterization of the causes of heritable variation within a species will be increasingly important. It is demonstrated that allelic variation in any two isolates of a species can be scanned, mapped, and scored directly and efficiently without allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, without creating new strains or constructs, and without knowing the specific nature of the variation. A total of 3714 biallelic markers, spaced about every 3.5 kilobases, were identified by analyzing the patterns obtained when total genomic DNA from two different strains of yeast was hybridized to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. The markers were then used to simultaneously map a multidrug-resistance locus and four other loci with high resolution (11 to 64 kilobases).
Synapsin I and synapsin II are neuron-specific phosphoproteins that have a role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and in the formation of nerve terminals. After depletion of synapsin II by antisense oligonucleotides, rat hippocampal neurons in culture were unable to consolidate their minor processes and did not elongate axons. These aberrant morphological changes were accompanied by an abnormal distribution of intracellular filamentous actin (F-actin). In addition, synapsin II suppression resulted in a selective decrease in the amounts of several synaptic vesicle-associated proteins. These data suggest that synapsin II participates in cytoskeletal organization during the early stages of nerve cell development.
To be able to calculate the contributions of individual amino acids to the electrostatic field of a protein would be of considerable value in designing proteins of enhanced or altered function and stability. Recent studies on the serine protease subtilisin provide direct measurements of the electrostatic potential in the active site of the enzyme produced by two charged amino acids. We have used these results to test a recently developed method for the calculation of electrostatic interactions between two specific sites on a protein. The extent of agreement between the theoretical and experimental results suggests that the continuum solvent model used in the calculations reproduces the essential features of the interaction.
The Pseudomonas syringae protein AvrPtoB is translocated into plant cells, where it inhibits immunity-associated programmed cell death (PCD). The structure of a C-terminal domain of AvrPtoB that is essential for anti-PCD activity reveals an unexpected homology to the U-box and RING-finger components of eukaryotic E3 ubiquitin ligases, and we show that AvrPtoB has ubiquitin ligase activity. Mutation of conserved residues involved in the binding of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes abolishes this activity in vitro, as well as anti-PCD activity in tomato leaves, which dramatically decreases virulence. These results show that Pseudomonas syringae uses a mimic of host E3 ubiquitin ligases to inactivate plant defenses.
Amino-acid radicals play key roles in many enzymatic reactions. Catalysis often involves transfer of a radical character within the protein, as in class I ribonucleotide reductase where radical transfer occurs over 35 A, from a tyrosyl radical to a cysteine. It is currently debated whether this kind of long-range transfer occurs by electron transfer, followed by proton release to create a neutral radical, or by H-atom transfer, that is, simultaneous transfer of electrons and protons. The latter mechanism avoids the energetic cost of charge formation in the low dielectric protein, but it is less robust to structural changes than is electron transfer. Available experimental data do not clearly discriminate between these proposals. We have studied the mechanism of photoactivation (light-induced reduction of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor) of Escherichia coli DNA photolyase using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. Here we show that the excited flavin adenine dinucleotide radical abstracts an electron from a nearby tryptophan in 30 ps. After subsequent electron transfer along a chain of three tryptophans, the most remote tryptophan (as a cation radical) releases a proton to the solvent in about 300 ns, showing that electron transfer occurs before proton dissociation. A similar process may take place in photolyase-like blue-light receptors.
Gene expression is modulated by regulatory elements that influence transcription elongation by RNA polymerase: terminators that disrupt the elongation complex and release RNA, and regulators that overcome termination signals. RNA release from Escherichia coli RNA polymerase can be induced by a complementary oligonucleotide that replaces the upstream half of the RNA hairpin stem of intrinsic terminator transcripts, implying that RNA hairpins act by extracting RNA from the transcription complex. A transcription antiterminator inhibits this activity of oligonucleotides and therefore protects the elongation complex from destabilizing attacks on the emerging transcript. These effects illuminate the structure of the complex and the mechanism of transcription termination.
The nucleotide sequence of cloned cDNA for preproenkephalin from bovine adrenal medulla indicates that the precursor protein contains four copies of Met-enkephalin and one copy each of Leu-enkephalin, Met-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 and Met-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8, a previously undetected opioid peptide. The enkephalin and extended enkephalin sequences are each bounded by paired basic amino acid residues. Preproenkephalin may represent a multi-hormone precursor, like the corticotropin-beta-lipotropin precursor.
In most models of DNA replication, Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding drives the incorporation of nucleotides into the new strand of DNA and maintains the complementarity of bases with the template strand. Studies with nonpolar analogues of thymine and adenine, however, have shown that replication is still efficient in the absence of hydrogen bonds. The replication of base pairs might also be influenced by steric exclusion, whereby inserted nucleotides need to be the correct size and shape to fit the active site against a template base. A simple steric-exclusion model may not require Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding to explain the fidelity of replication, nor should canonical purine and pyrimidine shapes be necessary for enzymatic synthesis of a base pair if each can fit into the DNA double helix without steric strain. Here we test this idea by using a pyrene nucleoside triphosphate (dPTP) in which the fluorescent 'base' is nearly as large as an entire Watson-Crick base pair. We show that the non-hydrogen-bonding dPTP is efficiently and specifically inserted by DNA polymerases opposite sites that lack DNA bases. The efficiency of this process approaches that of a natural base pair and the specificity is 10(2)-10(4)-fold. We use these properties to sequence abasic lesions in DNA, which are a common form of DNA damage in vivo. In addition to their application in identifying such genetic lesions, our results show that neither hydrogen bonds nor purine and pyrimidine structures are required to form a base pair with high efficiency and selectivity. These findings confirm that steric complementarity is an important factor in the fidelity of DNA synthesis.
In prokaryotes gene expression is mainly regulated at the levels of transcription and translation. An important form of translational control operates at the initiation of protein synthesis. For instance the translation of an existing mRNA can be prevented by features in the mRNA structure that prohibit binding of ribosomes. This type of control is frequently applied to polycistronic mRNA to forestall translation of a downstream cistron until the 5' neighbouring cistron has been read (1-7). Such translational coupling or sequential reading also facilitates the shutting off of several cistrons from one control point(6). An interesting example of a nontranslatable message is the lysis (L) cistron, present as an overlapping gene in the RNA bacteriophage MS2 (refs 8-10; Fig. 1). The start of the L cistron is not directly accessible to ribosomes. Instead its translation is strictly coupled to the passage of ribosomes over the preceding coat cistron(2). We have now analysed which features in the MS2 RNA structure deny ribosomes access to the start of the L message. We report here that small deletions, introduced about 40 nucleotides 5' to the start codon of the L gene, remove the initiation barrier and open the cistron to independent translation. An RNA secondary structure accounting for the closed state of the ribosome binding site is proposed.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) degradation of aberrant proteins is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here, a membrane-bound component of the ubiquitin system, Cue1p, was identified. It was shown to recruit the soluble ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p to the ER membrane. In the absence of Cue1p, unassembled and thus cytosolically mislocalized Ubc7p was unable to participate in ER degradation or in the turnover of soluble non-ER proteins. Moreover, ubiquitination by Cue1p-assembled Ubc7p and Ubc6p was a prerequisite for retrograde transport of lumenal substrates out of the ER, which suggests that ubiquitination is mechanistically integrated into the ER degradation process.
Analyses of various organisms for DNA polymerase-beta activity show that the enzyme is widely distributed in cells from multicellular animals but absent in bacteria, plants, and protozoa. These results suggest that DNA polymerase-beta may have evolved with the development of metazoan forms. Further evolutionary changes of the enzyme protein may account for some of the minor differences in properties of the enzyme in various organisms.
The crystal structure of a 27-kilodalton methylcobalamin-containing fragment of methionine synthase from Escherichia coli was determined at 3.0 A resolution. This structure depicts cobalamin-protein interactions and reveals that the corrin macrocycle lies between a helical amino-terminal domain and an alpha/beta carboxyl-terminal domain that is a variant of the Rossmann fold. Methylcobalamin undergoes a conformational change on binding the protein; the dimethylbenzimidazole group, which is coordinated to the cobalt in the free cofactor, moves away from the corrin and is replaced by a histidine contributed by the protein. The sequence Asp-X-His-X-X-Gly, which contains this histidine ligand, is conserved in the adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzymes methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase and glutamate mutase, suggesting that displacement of the dimethylbenzimidazole will be a feature common to many cobalamin-binding proteins. Thus the cobalt ligand, His759, and the neighboring residues Asp757 and Ser810, may form a catalytic quartet, Co-His-Asp-Ser, that modulates the reactivity of the B12 prosthetic group in methionine synthase.
X-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (XIAP) interacts with caspase-9 and inhibits its activity, whereas Smac (also known as DIABLO) relieves this inhibition through interaction with XIAP. Here we show that XIAP associates with the active caspase-9-Apaf-1 holoenzyme complex through binding to the amino terminus of the linker peptide on the small subunit of caspase-9, which becomes exposed after proteolytic processing of procaspase-9 at Asp315. Supporting this observation, point mutations that abrogate the proteolytic processing but not the catalytic activity of caspase-9, or deletion of the linker peptide, prevented caspase-9 association with XIAP and its concomitant inhibition. We note that the N-terminal four residues of caspase-9 linker peptide share significant homology with the N-terminal tetra-peptide in mature Smac and in the Drosophila proteins Hid/Grim/Reaper, defining a conserved class of IAP-binding motifs. Consistent with this finding, binding of the caspase-9 linker peptide and Smac to the BIR3 domain of XIAP is mutually exclusive, suggesting that Smac potentiates caspase-9 activity by disrupting the interaction of the linker peptide of caspase-9 with BIR3. Our studies reveal a mechanism in which binding to the BIR3 domain by two conserved peptides, one from Smac and the other one from caspase-9, has opposing effects on caspase activity and apoptosis.
Overexpression of a yeast gene, HAL2, allows the cells to tolerate higher than normal extracellular salt concentrations. HAL2 encodes a 3'(2')5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase that serves to remove the end products of sulfate transfer during cellular metabolism. The enzyme is inhibited by lithium and sodium and is activated by potassium. Metabolic systems that are sensitive to salt, as well as those governing osmolyte synthesis and ion transport, offer routes by which genetic engineering can be used to improve the tolerance of various organisms to salt.
Cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) is a ubiquitous mediator of intracellular signalling events. It acts principally through stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKAs) but also activates certain ion channels and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Epacs). Metabolism of cAMP is catalysed by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Here we identify a cAMP-responsive signalling complex maintained by the muscle-specific A-kinase anchoring protein (mAKAP) that includes PKA, PDE4D3 and Epac1. These intermolecular interactions facilitate the dissemination of distinct cAMP signals through each effector protein. Anchored PKA stimulates PDE4D3 to reduce local cAMP concentrations, whereas an mAKAP-associated ERK5 kinase module suppresses PDE4D3. PDE4D3 also functions as an adaptor protein that recruits Epac1, an exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1, to enable cAMP-dependent attenuation of ERK5. Pharmacological and molecular manipulations of the mAKAP complex show that anchored ERK5 can induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Thus, two coupled cAMP-dependent feedback loops are coordinated within the context of the mAKAP complex, suggesting that local control of cAMP signalling by AKAP proteins is more intricate than previously appreciated.
Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is a critical DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway required to maintain genome stability. Many prokaryotes possess a minimalist NHEJ apparatus required to repair DSBs during stationary phase, composed of two conserved core proteins, Ku and ligase D (LigD). The crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase domain of LigD mediating the synapsis of two noncomplementary DNA ends revealed a variety of interactions, including microhomology base pairing, mismatched and flipped-out bases, and 3' termini forming hairpin-like ends. Biochemical and biophysical studies confirmed that polymerase-induced end synapsis also occurs in solution. We propose that this DNA synaptic structure reflects an intermediate bridging stage of the NHEJ process, before end processing and ligation, with both the polymerase and the DNA sequence playing pivotal roles in determining the sequential order of synapsis and remodeling before end joining.
The activity of an enzyme system which readily converts estriol to 16-ketoestradiol is present only in the kidneys of mature female rats and is absent in the kidneys of male rats and immature rats of either sex. The full enzyme activity occurs in kidneys of rats of either sex at any stage of maturity after administration of estradiol for 2 weeks. The time course of the appearance and disappearance of the enzyme, the absence of detectable inhibitors and activators, and evaluation of cofactor requirements suggest that this may be an example of enzyme induction by the hormone. Furthermore, the enzyme activity itself represents a metabolic pathway for estriol metabolism whose potential quantitative significance has not heretofore been recognized.
Most drugs have been discovered in random screens or by exploiting information about macromolecular receptors. One source of this information is in the structures of critical proteins and nucleic acids. The structure-based approach to design couples this information with specialized computer programs to propose novel enzyme inhibitors and other therapeutic agents. Iterated design cycles have produced compounds now in clinical trials. The combination of molecular structure determination and computation is emerging as an important tool for drug development. These ideas will be applied to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and bacterial drug resistance.
Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin switch region are a hallmark feature of B-cell malignancies. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which primary B cells acquire or guard against these lesions. Here we find that translocations between c-myc and the IgH locus (Igh) are induced in primary B cells within hours of expression of the catalytically active form of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme that deaminates cytosine to produce uracil in DNA. Translocation also requires uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG), which removes uracil from DNA to create abasic sites that are then processed to double-strand breaks. The pathway that mediates aberrant joining of c-myc and Igh differs from intrachromosomal repair during immunoglobulin class switch recombination in that it does not require histone H2AX, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) or the non-homologous end-joining protein Ku80. In addition, translocations are inhibited by the tumour suppressors ATM, Nbs1, p19 (Arf) and p53, which is consistent with activation of DNA damage- and oncogenic stress-induced checkpoints during physiological class switching. Finally, we demonstrate that accumulation of AID-dependent, IgH-associated chromosomal lesions is not sufficient to enhance c-myc-Igh translocations. Our findings reveal a pathway for surveillance and protection against AID-dependent DNA damage, leading to chromosomal translocations.
New evidence indicates that termination of transcription is an important regulatory step, closely related to transcriptional interference and even transcriptional initiation. However, how this occurs is poorly understood. Recently, in vivo analysis of transcriptional termination for the human beta-globin gene revealed a new phenomenon--co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC). This primary cleavage event within beta-globin pre-messenger RNA, downstream of the poly(A) site, is critical for efficient transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II. Here we show that the CoTC process in the human beta-globin gene involves an RNA self-cleaving activity. We characterize the autocatalytic core of the CoTC ribozyme and show its functional role in efficient termination in vivo. The identified core CoTC is highly conserved in the 3' flanking regions of other primate beta-globin genes. Functionally, it resembles the 3' processive, self-cleaving ribozymes described for the protein-encoding genes from the myxomycetes Didymium iridis and Physarum polycephalum, indicating evolutionary conservation of this molecular process. We predict that regulated autocatalytic cleavage elements within pre-mRNAs may be a general phenomenon and that functionally it may provide the entry point for exonucleases involved in mRNA maturation, turnover and, in particular, transcriptional termination.
Detailed kinetic investigations of a catalytic antibody that promotes the hydrolyses of an anilide and phenyl ester show that this catalyst uses a multistep kinetic sequence resembling that found in serine proteases to hydrolyze its substrates, although antibody was elicited to a single transition-state analog. Like the serine proteases the antibody catalyzes the hydrolysis reactions through a putative covalent intermediate, but unlike the enzymes it may use hydroxide ion to cleave the intermediates. Nevertheless, the antibody is a potent catalyst with turnover at higher pH values rivaling that of chymotrypsin. This analysis also reveals that turnover by the antibody is ultimately limited by product desorption, suggesting that improvements in catalytic efficiency may be achieved by judicious changes in the structure of the substrate, so that it is not superimposable on that of the eliciting hapten.
We have shown recently that adaptive changes in the apparent amount of enzymes which synthesize and inactivate prostaglandins (PGs) occur in a reciprocal manner (see accompanying paper and refs 2-4). For example, PG synthetase activity in several rat organs is reduced but that of PG-metabolizing enzymes ('prostaglandinases') is increased after treatment with anti-inflammatory steroids. In view of recent reports that the synthesis of PG-like substances may be influenced by plasma factors, we wondered whether our findings may be explained in whole or in part by the presence in varying amounts of substances which affect PG synthesis and inactivation in opposite directions. We show here that rat plasma contains a protein factor(s) which inhibits the synthesis of PGs and enhances their enzymatic breakdown in vitro and which we provisionally call prostaglandin 'reciprocal coupling factor' (RCF). Furthermore, RCF is rapidly released in response to anti-inflammatory steroids and its levels are altered in the two model pathophysiological states so far investigated.
The nonapeptide hormone oxytocin-like arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is synthesized as part of a larger precursor polypeptide. The precursor also includes the neurophysin molecule with which the hormone is associated in the neurosecretory granules of the hypothalamo-pituitary tract. A protein of molecular weight (Mr) approximately 20,000 has been isolated from supraoptic nuclei of rat hypothalami which, after tryptic cleavage, released a neurophysin-like molecule of Mr approximately 10,000 and an oligopeptide related to oxytocin. This result was complemented by in vitro translation of bovine hypothalamic mRNA. Among the primary translation products a single polypeptide of Mr approximately 16,500 was shown to contain antigenic determinants recognized by specific antisera against bovine neurophysin I and oxytocin. Here we report the amino acid sequence of the bovine oxytocin-neurophysin I (OT-NpI) precursor which was derived from sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA. As is the case for the bovine arginine-vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NpII) precursor, the signal sequence of the OT-NpI precursor is immediately followed by the nonapeptide hormone which is connected to neurophysin I by a Gly-Lys-Arg sequence. A striking feature of the nucleic acid sequence is the 197-nucleotide long perfect homology with the AVP-NpII precursor mRNA sequence encoding the conserved middle part of neurophysins I and II.
Signalling through the receptor protein Notch, which is involved in crucial cell-fate decisions during development, requires ligand-induced cleavage of Notch. This cleavage occurs within the predicted transmembrane domain, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), and is reminiscent of gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a critical event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A deficiency in presenilin-1 (PS1) inhibits processing of APP by gamma-secretase in mammalian cells, and genetic interactions between Notch and PS1 homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that the presenilins may modulate the Notch signalling pathway. Here we report that, in mammalian cells, PS1 deficiency also reduces the proteolytic release of NICD from a truncated Notch construct, thus identifying the specific biochemical step of the Notch signalling pathway that is affected by PS1. Moreover, several gamma-secretase inhibitors block this same step in Notch processing, indicating that related protease activities are responsible for cleavage within the predicted transmembrane domains of Notch and APP. Thus the targeting of gamma-secretase for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease may risk toxicity caused by reduced Notch signalling.
Protein engineering is a means of probing the role of electrostatic interactions in protein functions; this elegant technique has been applied to the elucidation of electrostatic effects in enzyme catalysis. Here we show how the use of mutant proteins allows the determination of the contributions of individual charges to the free energy of ion binding to proteins. We have investigated the importance of three negatively charged side chains in the binding of Ca2+ to bovine calbindin D9K (ref.2): these are clustered around the calcium sites but are not directly involved as ligands. Each of these charges is found to contribute approximately 7 kJ mol-1 to the free energy of binding of two Ca2+ ions and to affect the cooperativity of Ca2+ binding. The influence of surface charges on ion binding to proteins may be more common than generally supposed and could have important consequences for protein function.
Recently Zhang et al. cloned a gene that is expressed only in adipose tissue of the mouse. The obese phenotype of the ob/ob mouse is linked to a mutation in the obese gene that results in expression of a truncated inactive protein. Human and rat homologues for this gene are known. Previous experiments predict such a hormone to have a hypothalamic target. Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y stimulates food intake, decreases thermogenesis, and increases plasma insulin and corticosterone levels making it a potential target. Here we express the obese protein in Escherichia coli and find that it suppresses food intake and decreases body weight dramatically when administered to normal and ob/ob mice but not db/db (diabetic) mice, which are thought to lack the appropriate receptor. High-affinity binding was detected in the rat hypothalamus. One mechanism by which this protein regulated food intake and metabolism was inhibition of neuropeptide-Y synthesis and release.
Nitric oxide (NO), apparently identical to endothelium-derived relaxing factor in blood vessels, is also formed by cytotoxic macrophages, in adrenal gland and in brain tissue, where it mediates the stimulation by glutamate of cyclic GMP formation in the cerebellum. Stimulation of intestinal or anococcygeal nerves liberates NO, and the resultant muscle relaxation is blocked by arginine derivatives that inhibit NO synthesis. It is, however, unclear whether in brain or intestine, NO released following nerve stimulation is formed in neurons, glia, fibroblasts, muscle or blood cells, all of which occur in proximity to neurons and so could account for effects of nerve stimulation on cGMP and muscle tone. We have now localized NO synthase protein immunohistochemically in the rat using antisera to the purified enzyme. We demonstrate NO synthase in the brain to be exclusively associated with discrete neuronal populations. NO synthase is also concentrated in the neural innervation of the posterior pituitary, in autonomic nerve fibres in the retina, in cell bodies and nerve fibres in the myenteric plexus of the intestine, in adrenal medulla, and in vascular endothelial cells. These prominent neural localizations provide the first conclusive evidence for a strong association of NO with neurons.
Eukaryotic cells store neutral lipids in cytoplasmic lipid droplets enclosed in a monolayer of phospholipids and associated proteins. These dynamic organelles serve as the principal reservoirs for storing cellular energy and for the building blocks for membrane lipids. Excessive lipid accumulation in cells is a central feature of obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis, yet remarkably little is known about lipid-droplet cell biology. Here we show, by means of a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila S2 cells that about 1.5% of all genes function in lipid-droplet formation and regulation. The phenotypes of the gene knockdowns sorted into five distinct phenotypic classes. Genes encoding enzymes of phospholipid biosynthesis proved to be determinants of lipid-droplet size and number, suggesting that the phospholipid composition of the monolayer profoundly affects droplet morphology and lipid utilization. A subset of the Arf1-COPI vesicular transport proteins also regulated droplet morphology and lipid utilization, thereby identifying a previously unrecognized function for this machinery. These phenotypes are conserved in mammalian cells, suggesting that insights from these studies are likely to be central to our understanding of human diseases involving excessive lipid storage.
Alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNA is a key feature of transcriptome expansion in eukaryotic cells, yet its regulation is poorly understood. Spliceosome assembly occurs co-transcriptionally, raising the possibility that DNA structure may directly influence alternative splicing. Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. Here we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide. We further show that CTCF binding to CD45 exon 5 is inhibited by DNA methylation, leading to reciprocal effects on exon 5 inclusion. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for developmental regulation of splicing outcome through heritable epigenetic marks.
The Rab GTPases function as specific regulators of membrane transport. The GTP/GDP cycle is believed to control shuttling of Rab proteins between the cytosol and organelle membranes. In vitro, Rab proteins are removed from membranes by a protein that inhibits GDP dissociation (rabGDI), which leads to formation of a cytosolic complex of Rab with the inhibitor protein. Here we use a purified Rab5-rabGDI complex in a permeabilized cell system to investigate how the cytosolic complexed form of Rab reassociates with the membrane. We find that exogenous Rab5 is correctly targeted and induces the formation of enlarged early endosomes, demonstrating that it is functionally active. Binding of Rab5 to the acceptor membrane is accompanied by release of the rabGDI protein into the cytosol. A transient GDP-Rab5 intermediate was detected which was subsequently converted into the GTP-bound form. Our results indicate that there is a multistep mechanism for the insertion of Rab5 into the membrane which is mediated by a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor.
Structured RNAs embedded in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of messenger RNAs can regulate gene expression. In bacteria, control of a metabolite gene is mediated by the self-cleaving activity of a ribozyme embedded in its 5' UTR. This discovery has raised the question of whether gene-regulating ribozymes also exist in eukaryotic mRNAs. Here we show that highly active hammerhead ribozymes are present in the 3' UTRs of rodent C-type lectin type II (Clec2) genes. Using a hammerhead RNA motif search with relaxed delimitation of the non-conserved regions, we detected ribozyme sequences in which the invariant regions, in contrast to the previously identified continuous hammerheads, occur as two fragments separated by hundreds of nucleotides. Notably, a fragment pair can assemble to form an active hammerhead ribozyme structure between the translation termination and the polyadenylation signals within the 3' UTR. We demonstrate that this hammerhead structure can self-cleave both in vitro and in vivo, and is able to reduce protein expression in mouse cells. These results indicate that an unrecognized mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation involving association of discontinuous ribozyme sequences within an mRNA may be modulating the expression of several CLEC2 proteins that function in bone remodelling and the immune response of several mammals.
We report crystal structures of the 2.6-megadalton alpha6beta6 heterododecameric fatty acid synthase from Thermomyces lanuginosus at 3.1 angstrom resolution. The alpha and beta polypeptide chains form the six catalytic domains required for fatty acid synthesis and numerous expansion segments responsible for extensive intersubunit connections. Detailed views of all active sites provide insights into substrate specificities and catalytic mechanisms and reveal their unique characteristics, which are due to the integration into the multienzyme. The mode of acyl carrier protein attachment in the reaction chamber, together with the spatial distribution of active sites, suggests that iterative substrate shuttling is achieved by a relatively restricted circular motion of the carrier domain in the multifunctional enzyme.
Breast cancer is frequently a hormone-dependent tumour, and several studies have suggested that the pineal gland hormone melatonin may influence the growth and development of this malignancy. Subcutaneous injections of melatonin have been shown to inhibit, and pinealectomy to enhance, the development of dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumours in rats. Use of the psychotropic drug thorazine, which increases plasma melatonin levels, has been associated with a decreased incidence of breast cancer in psychiatric patients. Calcification of the pineal gland has been correlated with an increased incidence of breast cancer in women. While the mechanism by which melatonin influences these tumours is unknown, both human breast cancer and DMBA-induced tumours contain oestrogen receptors (ER) and respond to changes in the oestrogen milieu. We therefore wondered whether melatonin might be altering ER binding activity of these tumours. We report here that in vitro incubation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells with melatonin in physiological conditions increased the cytoplasmic and nuclear ER activity of these cells within 40 min, giving no change in the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the receptor. This induction was blocked by cycloheximide, and thus requires continuous protein synthesis. The modulation of ER binding activity of breast cancer by another endogenous hormone may be important for understanding the behaviour and treatment of this disease, and may provide insight into the factors regulating the synthesis and metabolism of steroid hormone receptors.
A gene encoding a protein related to the serpin family of protease inhibitors was identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene that may play a role in human breast cancer. The gene product, called maspin, is expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells but not in most mammary carcinoma cell lines. Transfection of MDA-MB-435 mammary carcinoma cells with the maspin gene did not alter the cells' growth properties in vitro, but reduced the cells' ability to induce tumors and metastasize in nude mice and to invade through a basement membrane matrix in vitro. Analysis of human breast cancer specimens revealed that loss of maspin expression occurred most frequently in advanced cancers. These results support the hypothesis that maspin functions as a tumor suppressor.
Transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA), the canonical zinc-finger protein, is a protein of relative molecular mass 39,000 (39K) that is required for transcription of 5S-ribosomal subunit genes in Xenopus. It binds in a sequence-specific manner to the internal control region of the 5S gene (see Fig. 1) and facilitates transcription of the gene by RNA polymerase III. It also binds to the 5S gene product to form a 7S ribonucleoprotein particle. In oocytes the 7S particle acts as a storage form of the RNA to be utilized later in development. TFIIIA binds to DNA through its 30 K N-terminal domain, which contains nine zinc-fingers. TFIIIA was the first protein described to have this type of DNA binding motif, but numerous other proteins have now been shown to have zinc-finger domains. A structure for a single zinc-finger from the yeast protein ADR1, was recently proposed based on two-dimensional NMR data (ref. 8), and a similar structure was proposed based on comparison with crystal structures of other metalloproteins. Although models for the interaction of TFIIIA with the 5S-ribosomal gene DNA have been proposed, based on nuclease digestion and methylation interference data, little precise structural information is available for TFIIIA and the physical basis for the interaction of zinc-fingers with DNA is not understood. Using both circular permutation and circularization assays we provide convincing biochemical evidence that TFIIIA bends the DNA at the internal promoter of the 5S gene.
We modeled how the charged levels of different transfer RNAs (tRNAs) that carry the same amino acid (isoacceptors) respond when this amino acid becomes growth-limiting. The charged levels will approach zero for some isoacceptors (such as tRNA2Leu) and remain high for others (such as tRNA4Leu), as determined by the concentrations of isoacceptors and how often their codons occur in protein synthesis. The theory accounts for (synonymous) codons for the same amino acid that are used in ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation, the choices of synonymous codons in trans-translating transfermessenger RNA, and the overrepresentation of rare codons in messenger RNAs for amino acid biosynthetic enzymes.
The fluorescence decay time (tau) was 2 to 5 nanoseconds for proteins and 4 to 5 nanoseconds for flavin, pyridine nucleotide, and vitamin B(6)coenzymes; tau varied widely in 48 compounds measured in water. Altholugh reported values of tau for a few of the soluttions studied were in excellenlt agreement. previously "calculated" lifetimes, in severall instances, are apparently erroneous. Nonexponential decay was detectable with our "nanosecond-flash" apparatus, a modification of the first commercially aavilable unit for determination of tau.
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated cytotoxicity represents the body's major defence against virus-infected and tumorigenic cells, and contributes to transplant rejection and autoimmune disease. During killing, CTL granules are exocytosed, releasing their contents into the intercellular space between the target cell and the effector. Perforin facilitates the entry of cytotoxic cell serine proteases, the granzymes, into the target cell, where they induce apoptotic death by an unknown pathway. Granzyme B is essential for the induction of DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in target cells, yet its substrate is unknown. Identification of the intracellular substrate for granzyme B is therefore the key to understanding the mechanism of CTL-mediated killing. Here we show that granzyme B cleaves and activates CPP32, the precursor of the protease responsible for cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.
In cell-free extracts derived from Streptococcus faecalis, protein synthesis directed by endogenous messenger RNA increases as the culture ages. The increased activity is accompanied by an increase in the percentage of membranebound ribosomes and by a decrease in ribosomal monomers and subunits. These changes progress against a background of structural and compositional modifications in the membrane. Membrane modifications possibly related to endogenously directed protein synthesis in cell-free extracts include: (i) decreased specific activity of a membrane-associated polynucleotide phosphorylase capable of polysome degradation, and (ii) increased concentrations of certain phospholipids.
A method of combinatorial cassette mutagenesis was designed to readily determine the informational content of individual residues in protein sequences. The technique consists of simultaneously randomizing two or three positions by oligonucleotide cassette mutagenesis, selecting for functional protein, and then sequencing to determine the spectrum of allowable substitutions at each position. Repeated application of this method to the dimer interface of the DNA-binding domain of lambda repressor reveals that the number and type of substitutions allowed at each position are extremely variable. At some positions only one or two residues are functionally acceptable; at other positions a wide range of residues and residue types are tolerated. The number of substitutions allowed at each position roughly correlates with the solvent accessibility of the wild-type side chain.
T7 DNA polymerase catalyses DNA replication in vitro at rates of more than 100 bases per second and has a 3'-->5' exonuclease (nucleotide removing) activity at a separate active site. This enzyme possesses a 'right hand' shape which is common to most polymerases with fingers, palm and thumb domains. The rate-limiting step for replication is thought to involve a conformational change between an 'open fingers' state in which the active site samples nucleotides, and a 'closed' state in which nucleotide incorporation occurs. DNA polymerase must function as a molecular motor converting chemical energy into mechanical force as it moves over the template. Here we show, using a single-molecule assay based on the differential elasticity of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, that mechanical force is generated during the rate-limiting step and that the motor can work against a maximum template tension of approximately 34 pN. Estimates of the mechanical and entropic work done by the enzyme show that T7 DNA polymerase organizes two template bases in the polymerization site during each catalytic cycle. We also find a force-induced 100-fold increase in exonucleolysis above 40 pN.
Heterotrimeric guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G proteins) are deactivated by hydrolysis of the GTP that they bind when activated by transmembrane receptors. Transducin, the G protein that relays visual excitation from rhodopsin to the cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase (PDE) in retinal photoreceptors, must be deactivated for the light response to recover. A point mutation in the gamma subunit of PDE impaired transducin-PDE interactions and slowed the recovery rate of the flash response in transgenic mouse rods. These results indicate that the normal deactivation of transducin in vivo requires the G protein to interact with its target enzyme.
Leader peptidase spans the Escherichia coli plasma membrane with its amino-terminal domain facing the cytoplasm and its carboxyl terminus facing the periplasm. It is made without a cleavable leader sequence. The three apolar domains near the amino terminus of the peptidase are candidates for internal "signal sequences" and they anchor the protein to the lipid bilayer. Oligonucleotide-directed deletion was used to show that only the second domain has an essential function in membrane assembly. While this second apolar domain is crucial for membrane assembly, its continued function when disrupted by arginine suggests that its apolar character per se is not its only important feature.
Recent discoveries of activator proteins that distort DNA but bear no obvious activation domains have focused attention on the role of DNA structure in transcriptional regulation. Here we describe how the transcription factor MerR can mediate repression as well as activation through stereospecific modulation of DNA structure. The repressor form of MerR binds between the -10 and -35 promoter elements of the bacterial mercury-detoxification genes, PT, allowing RNA polymerase to form an inactive complex with PT and MerR at this stress-inducible promoter. Upon mercuric ion binding, Hg-MerR converts this polymerase complex into the transcriptionally active or 'open' form. We show here that MerR bends DNA towards itself in a manner similar to the bacterial catabolite-activator protein CAP, namely at two loci demarked by DNase I sensitivity, and that the activator conformation, Hg-MeR, relaxes these bends. This activator-induced unbending, when coupled with the previously described untwisting of the operator, remodels the promoter and makes it a better template for the poised polymerase.
The three-dimensional crystal structure of seryl-transfer RNA synthetase from Escherichia coli, refined at 2.5 A resolution, is described. It has an N-terminal domain that forms an antiparallel alpha helical coiled-coil, stretching 60 A out into the solvent and stabilized by interhelical hydrophobic interactions and an active-site alpha-beta domain based around a seven-stranded antiparallel beta sheet. Unlike the three other known synthetase structures, the enzyme contains no classical nucleotide-binding fold, and is the first representative of a second class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase structures.
Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder of connective tissue manifested in the ocular, skeletal and cardiovascular systems. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant with high penetrance, but has great clinical variability. Linkage studies have mapped the Marfan locus to chromosome 15q15-21.3. There have been no reports of genetic heterogeneity in the syndrome. Following the identification of fibrillin (a glycoprotein component of the extracellular microfibril), immunohistopathological quantification of the protein in skin and fibroblast culture, and examination of fibrillin synthesis, extracellular transport, and incorporation into the extracellular matrix (D. M. Milewicz, R.E.P., E. S. Crawford and P. H. Byers, manuscript in preparation) have demonstrated abnormalities of fibrillin metabolism in most patients. A portion of the complementary DNA encoding fibrillin has been cloned and mapped by in situ hybridization to chromosome 15. Here we report that the fibrillin gene is linked to the Marfan phenotype (theta = 0.00; logarithm of the odds (lod) = 3.9) and describe a de novo missense mutation in the fibrillin gene in two patients with sporadic disease. We thus implicate fibrillin as the protein defective in patients with the Marfan syndrome.
Multiple enzymatic activities are required for transcriptional initiation. The enzyme DNA topoisomerase II associates with gene promoter regions and can generate breaks in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Therefore, it is of interest to know whether this enzyme is critical for regulated gene activation. We report that the signal-dependent activation of gene transcription by nuclear receptors and other classes of DNA binding transcription factors, including activating protein 1, requires DNA topoisomerase IIbeta-dependent, transient, site-specific dsDNA break formation. Subsequent to the break, poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1 enzymatic activity is induced, which is required for a nucleosome-specific histone H1-high-mobility group B exchange event and for local changes of chromatin architecture. Our data mechanistically link DNA topoisomerase IIbeta-dependent dsDNA breaks and the components of the DNA damage and repair machinery in regulated gene transcription.
Polypeptide receptors on mammalian plasma membranes can be categorized on the basis of function. The binding of ligand by class I receptors results in changes in cell metabolism or behavior. Hormone-receptor interactions typify this group. The binding of ligand by class II receptors in ligand internalization. Although changes in cellular activity may result from metabolism of the internalized ligand, the interaction between ligand and class II receptor does not itself lead to alterations in cell behavior. Class II receptors include those for low-density lipoproteins and for alpha-macroglobulin-protease complexes. Although receptors within each category are chemically disparate, they show striking similarities in behavior. Analysis of the behavioral patterns of receptors in each category reveals insights into receptor physiology and allows for a prospective analysis of receptor characteristics.
Energy transfer provides an arrow in the metabolism of living systems. Direct energetic coupling of chemical transformations, such that the free energy generated in one reaction is channeled to another, is the essence of energy transfer, whereas the purpose is the production of high-energy chemical intermediates. Vitamin K provides a particularly instructive example of energy transfer. A key principle at work in the vitamin K system can be termed "base strength amplification." In the base strength amplification sequence, the free energy of oxygenation of vitamin K hydroquinone (vitamin KH2) is used to transform a weak base to a strong base in order to effect proton removal from selected glutamate (Glu) residues in the blood-clotting proteins.
Small RNAs bound to Argonaute proteins recognize partially or fully complementary nucleic acid targets in diverse gene-silencing processes. A subgroup of the Argonaute proteins--known as the 'Piwi family'--is required for germ- and stem-cell development in invertebrates, and two Piwi members--MILI and MIWI--are essential for spermatogenesis in mouse. Here we describe a new class of small RNAs that bind to MILI in mouse male germ cells, where they accumulate at the onset of meiosis. The sequences of the over 1,000 identified unique molecules share a strong preference for a 5' uridine, but otherwise cannot be readily classified into sequence families. Genomic mapping of these small RNAs reveals a limited number of clusters, suggesting that these RNAs are processed from long primary transcripts. The small RNAs are 26-31 nucleotides (nt) in length--clearly distinct from the 21-23 nt of microRNAs (miRNAs) or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs)--and we refer to them as 'Piwi-interacting RNAs' or piRNAs. Orthologous human chromosomal regions also give rise to small RNAs with the characteristics of piRNAs, but the cloned sequences are distinct. The identification of this new class of small RNAs provides an important starting point to determine the molecular function of Piwi proteins in mammalian spermatogenesis.
CD38 is a 42-kilodalton glycoprotein expressed extensively on B and T lymphocytes. CD38 exhibits a structural homology to Aplysia adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyl cyclase. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a metabolite of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) with calcium-mobilizing activity. A complementary DNA encoding the extracellular domain of murine CD38 was constructed and expressed, and the resultant recombinant soluble CD38 was purified to homogeneity. Soluble CD38 catalyzed the formation and hydrolysis of cADPR when added to NAD+. Purified cADPR augmented the proliferative response of activated murine B cells, potentially implicating the enzymatic activity of CD38 in lymphocyte function.
Protein phosphorylation is now recognized to be the major general mechanism by which intracellular events in mammalian tissues are controlled by external physiological stimuli. However, only recently has the idea that different cellular functions are controlled by common protein kinases and protein phosphatases started to gain widespread acceptance. Thus there is an integrated network of regulatory pathways, mediated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, that allows diverse cellular events to be coordinated by neural and hormonal stimuli. The evidence that supports this concept is reviewed, with emphasis on the role of protein phosphorylation in enzyme regulation.
Hundreds of small RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides, collectively named microRNAs (miRNAs), have been discovered recently in animals and plants. Although their functions are being unravelled, their mechanism of biogenesis remains poorly understood. miRNAs are transcribed as long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) whose maturation occurs through sequential processing events: the nuclear processing of the pri-miRNAs into stem-loop precursors of approximately 70 nucleotides (pre-miRNAs), and the cytoplasmic processing of pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs. Dicer, a member of the RNase III superfamily of bidentate nucleases, mediates the latter step, whereas the processing enzyme for the former step is unknown. Here we identify another RNase III, human Drosha, as the core nuclease that executes the initiation step of miRNA processing in the nucleus. Immunopurified Drosha cleaved pri-miRNA to release pre-miRNA in vitro. Furthermore, RNA interference of Drosha resulted in the strong accumulation of pri-miRNA and the reduction of pre-miRNA and mature miRNA in vivo. Thus, the two RNase III proteins, Drosha and Dicer, may collaborate in the stepwise processing of miRNAs, and have key roles in miRNA-mediated gene regulation in processes such as development and differentiation.
The success of cisplatin in cancer chemotherapy derives from its ability to crosslink DNA and alter the structure. Most cisplatin-DNA adducts are intrastrand d(GpG) and d(ApG) crosslinks, which unwind and bend the duplex to facilitate the binding of proteins that contain one or more high-mobility group (HMG) domains. When HMG-domain proteins such as HMG1, IXR (intrastrand-crosslink recognition) protein from yeast, or human upstream-binding factor (hUBF) bind cisplatin intrastrand crosslinks, they can be diverted from their natural binding sites on the genome and shield the adducts from excision repair. These activities sensitize cells to cisplatin and contribute to its cytotoxic properties. Crystallographic information about the structure of cisplatin-DNA adducts has been limited to short single-stranded deoxyoligonucleotides such as cis-[Pt(NH3)2(d(pGpG))]. Here we describe the X-ray structure at 2.6 A resolution of a double-stranded DNA dodecamer containing this adduct. Our information provides, to our knowledge, the first crystallographic look at a platinated DNA duplex and should help the design of new platinum and other metal crosslinking antitumour drug candidates. Moreover, the structure reveals a unique fusion of A- and B-type DNA segments that could be of more general importance.
Propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (PCC), a mitochondrial biotin-dependent enzyme, is essential for the catabolism of the amino acids Thr, Val, Ile and Met, cholesterol and fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms. Deficiencies in PCC activity in humans are linked to the disease propionic acidaemia, an autosomal recessive disorder that can be fatal in infants. The holoenzyme of PCC is an alpha(6)beta(6) dodecamer, with a molecular mass of 750 kDa. The alpha-subunit contains the biotin carboxylase (BC) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domains, whereas the beta-subunit supplies the carboxyltransferase (CT) activity. Here we report the crystal structure at 3.2-A resolution of a bacterial PCC alpha(6)beta(6) holoenzyme as well as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction at 15-A resolution demonstrating a similar structure for human PCC. The structure defines the overall architecture of PCC and reveals unexpectedly that the alpha-subunits are arranged as monomers in the holoenzyme, decorating a central beta(6) hexamer. A hitherto unrecognized domain in the alpha-subunit, formed by residues between the BC and BCCP domains, is crucial for interactions with the beta-subunit. We have named it the BT domain. The structure reveals for the first time the relative positions of the BC and CT active sites in the holoenzyme. They are separated by approximately 55 A, indicating that the entire BCCP domain must translocate during catalysis. The BCCP domain is located in the active site of the beta-subunit in the current structure, providing insight for its involvement in the CT reaction. The structural information establishes a molecular basis for understanding the large collection of disease-causing mutations in PCC and is relevant for the holoenzymes of other biotin-dependent carboxylases, including 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) and eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).
Exogenous reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide was not oxidized by mitochondria but by cytoplasmic hydrogen-accepting systems catalyzed by lactic, alpha-glycerophosphate, and malic dehydrogenases. The three enzymes were found in all tissues of the mouse; the amount of activity of each enzyme differed in the various tissues, however. It is suggested that each tissue has a unique pattern for oxidation of extramitochondrial diphosphopyridine nucleotide.
Deregulation of cell proliferation is a hallmark of neoplastic transformation. Alteration in growth control pathways must translate into changes in the cell-cycle regulatory machinery, but the mechanism by which this occurs is largely unknown. Compared with normal human fibroblasts, cells transformed with a variety of viral oncoproteins show striking changes in the subunit composition of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In normal cells, CDKs exist predominantly in multiple quaternary complexes, each containing a CDK, cyclin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the p21 protein. However, in many transformed cells, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and p21 are lost from these multiprotein enzymes. Here we have investigated the significance of this phenomenon by molecular cloning of p21 and in vitro reconstitution of the quaternary cell-cycle kinase complexes. We find that p21 inhibits the activity of each member of the cyclin/CDK family. Furthermore, overexpression of p21 inhibits the proliferation of mammalian cells. Our results indicate that p21 may be a universal inhibitor of cyclin kinases.
The protein TFIIB is a general transcription initiation factor that interacts with a promoter complex (D.DNA) containing the TATA-binding subunit (TFIID tau, or TBP) of TFIID to facilitate subsequent interaction with RNA polymerase II (ref. 2) through the associated TFIIF (ref. 3). The potential bridging function of TFIIB raises the possibility of two structural domains and emphasizes the importance of TFIIB structure-function studies for a further understanding of preinitiation complex assembly and function. Here we show that human TFIIB (refs 5,6) is comprised of functionally distinct N- and C-terminal domains. The C-terminal domain, containing the direct repeats and associated basic regions, is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the D.DNA complex. By contrast, the N-terminal domain that is dispensable for formation of the TFIID tau-TFIIB-promoter (D.B.DNA) complex is required for subsequent events leading to basal transcription initiation. On the basis of these results, we discuss structural and functional similarities between TFIIB and TFIID tau, which have similar structural organization and motifs.
In Drosophila and human cells, the TATA binding protein (TBP) of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex is tightly associated with multiple subunits termed TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that are essential for mediating regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription. The Drosophila TAFII150 has now been molecularly cloned and biochemically characterized. The deduced primary amino acid sequence of dTAFII150 reveals a striking similarity to the essential yeast gene, TSM-1. Furthermore, like dTAFII150, the TSM-1 protein is found associated with the TBP in vivo, thus identifying the first yeast homolog of a TAF associated with TFIID. Both the product of TSM-1 and dTAFII150 bind directly to TBP and dTAFII250, demonstrating a functional similarity between human and yeast TAFs. Surprisingly, DNA binding studies indicate that purified recombinant dTAFII150 binds specifically to DNA sequences overlapping the start site of transcription. The data demonstrate that at least one of the TAFs is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein and that dTAFII150 together with TBP are responsible for TFIID interactions with an extended region of the core promoter.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious cause of chronic liver disease worldwide with more than 170 million infected individuals at risk of developing significant morbidity and mortality. Current interferon-based therapies are suboptimal especially in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, and they are poorly tolerated, highlighting the unmet medical need for new therapeutics. The HCV-encoded NS3 protease is essential for viral replication and has long been considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in HCV-infected patients. Here we identify a class of specific and potent NS3 protease inhibitors and report the evaluation of BILN 2061, a small molecule inhibitor biologically available through oral ingestion and the first of its class in human trials. Administration of BILN 2061 to patients infected with HCV genotype 1 for 2 days resulted in an impressive reduction of HCV RNA plasma levels, and established proof-of-concept in humans for an HCV NS3 protease inhibitor. Our results further illustrate the potential of the viral-enzyme-targeted drug discovery approach for the development of new HCV therapeutics.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, an effective RNA interference (RNAi) response requires the production of secondary short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by RNA-directed RNA polymerases (RdRPs). We cloned secondary siRNAs from transgenic C. elegans lines expressing a single 22-nucleotide primary siRNA. Several secondary siRNAs start a few nucleotides downstream of the primary siRNA, indicating that non-RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)-cleaved mRNAs are substrates for secondary siRNA production. In lines expressing primary siRNAs with single-nucleotide mismatches, secondary siRNAs do not carry the mismatch but contain the nucleotide complementary to the mRNA. We infer that RdRPs perform unprimed RNA synthesis. Secondary siRNAs are only of antisense polarity, carry 5' di- or triphosphates, and are only in the minority associated with RDE-1, the RNAi-specific Argonaute protein. Therefore, secondary siRNAs represent a distinct class of small RNAs. Their biogenesis depends on RdRPs, and we propose that each secondary siRNA is an individual RdRP product.
The Drosophila ether-a-go-go (eag) mutant is responsible for altered potassium currents in excitable tissue. These mutants exhibit spontaneous, repetitive firing of action potentials in the motor axons of larval neuromuscular junctions. The eag gene encodes a polypeptide that shares sequence similarities with several different ionic channel proteins, including voltage-gated potassium channels, an inward rectifier as well as cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels. These formal similarities in the derived primary sequences indicate that eag polypeptides might express a new type of ion channel. Here we report the expression by eag RNA in Xenopus oocytes of such a channel which incorporates properties of both voltage- and ligand-gated channels. The permeability of these eag channels to potassium and calcium is dependent on voltage and cyclic AMP. The ability to mediate potassium-outward and calcium-inward currents endows this channel with properties likely to be important in the modulation of synaptic efficiency in both central and peripheral nervous systems.
Rats with hypertrophic smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and increased activities of the drug-handling enzymes induced by dieldrin were stressed with larger doses of the pesticide. The activity of the drug-handling enzymes was thus reduced, but liver weight, smooth ER, and P-450 hemoprotein remained elevated. While no changes were apparent by light microscopy, the hypertrophic, hypoactive smooth ER was recognized as tight clusters of tubular membranes associated with abnormalities of the mitochondrial membrane. Similar but not identical morphologic changes were noted in human liver diseases associated with hepatic insufficiency. Hypertrophic, hypoactive smooth ER may indicate transition from adaptation of injury, and can be used as a sensitive parameter of toxicity.
A new procedure for generating and isolating random single-base substitutions in cloned DNA fragments is presented. The mutations are generated by treatment of single-stranded DNA with various chemicals, followed by the synthesis of the complementary strand with reverse transcriptase. Misincorporation frequently occurs when the enzyme encounters a damaged base in the mutagenized template DNA. The resulting duplex DNA fragments containing random single-base substitutions are cloned, amplified as a population, and isolated from wild-type DNA by preparative denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The physical separation of mutant DNA fragments makes it possible to isolate and characterize large numbers of site-directed single-base substitutions in the absence of a phenotypic selection. This procedure should be generally applicable to the fine-structure genetic analysis of regulatory and protein-coding sequences.
Tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) is a key component in NF-kappaB signalling triggered by TNF-alpha. Genetic evidence indicates that TRAF2 is necessary for the polyubiquitination of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) that then serves as a platform for recruitment and stimulation of IkappaB kinase, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Although TRAF2 is a RING domain ubiquitin ligase, direct evidence that TRAF2 catalyses the ubiquitination of RIP1 is lacking. TRAF2 binds to sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), one of the isoenzymes that generates the pro-survival lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) inside cells. Here we show that SphK1 and the production of S1P is necessary for lysine-63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP1, phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase and IkappaBalpha, and IkappaBalpha degradation, leading to NF-kappaB activation. These responses were mediated by intracellular S1P independently of its cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors. S1P specifically binds to TRAF2 at the amino-terminal RING domain and stimulates its E3 ligase activity. S1P, but not dihydro-S1P, markedly increased recombinant TRAF2-catalysed lysine-63-linked, but not lysine-48-linked, polyubiquitination of RIP1 in vitro in the presence of the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2) UbcH13 or UbcH5a. Our data show that TRAF2 is a novel intracellular target of S1P, and that S1P is the missing cofactor for TRAF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, indicating a new paradigm for the regulation of lysine-63-linked polyubiquitination. These results also highlight the key role of SphK1 and its product S1P in TNF-alpha signalling and the canonical NF-kappaB activation pathway important in inflammatory, antiapoptotic and immune processes.
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key regulator of pain perception, cognitive function, and affective mood. Three common haplotypes of the human COMT gene, divergent in two synonymous and one nonsynonymous position, code for differences in COMT enzymatic activity and are associated with pain sensitivity. Haplotypes divergent in synonymous changes exhibited the largest difference in COMT enzymatic activity, due to a reduced amount of translated protein. The major COMT haplotypes varied with respect to messenger RNA local stem-loop structures, such that the most stable structure was associated with the lowest protein levels and enzymatic activity. Site-directed mutagenesis that eliminated the stable structure restored the amount of translated protein. These data highlight the functional significance of synonymous variations and suggest the importance of haplotypes over single-nucleotide polymorphisms for analysis of genetic variations.
Mouse nuclear factors that bind to an upstream metal regulatory element of the mouse metallothionein-I gene have been identified by DNA footprinting and oligonucleotide band shift assays. The formation of complexes at this site can be activated 20- to 40-fold by the vitro addition of ionic cadmium. The activation reaction is rapid, reversible by a metal chelator, and may involve multiple proteins. These results suggest that the initial step in cadmium detoxification is an interaction between the metal and nuclear DNA-binding factors leading to an increase in metallothionein gene transcription. The ability to observe metal activation in vitro makes this a powerful system to study the biochemistry of eukaryotic gene regulation.
Eukaryotic messenger RNAs are translated with unequal efficiencies in vivo and in vitro and the molecular basis of this phenomenon is not understood. As an approach to understanding the role of the 5' untranslated leader sequence in regulating mRNA translational efficiency, chimaeric mRNAs have been generated by joining a heterologous leader to complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences, followed by in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase and in vitro protein synthesis. We used the untranslated leader from the coat protein mRNA of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV RNA 4), a well-translated, highly competitive message, to replace the leader sequence of barley alpha-amylase (B alpha A) and human interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) cDNAs. Deletion of transcribed vector sequences and replacement of the native untranslated region with the AMV RNA 4 leader can result in as much as a 35-fold increase in mRNA translational efficiency; moreover, the translational efficiency of the chimaeric mRNAs containing the AMV RNA 4 leader is at least as great as that of virion RNA 4. The results suggest that the chimaeric AMV-mRNAs have either a higher relative affinity or a diminished requirement for a limiting component(s) of the translational machinery; in addition, it may be feasible, through use of heterologous leader sequences, to increase expression of engineered genes or cDNAs without changing the antigenic or biological properties of the encoded protein.
Cyanobacterial carbon fixation is a major component of the global carbon cycle. This process requires the carboxysome, an organelle-like proteinaceous microcompartment that sequesters the enzymes of carbon fixation from the cytoplasm. Here, fluorescently tagged carboxysomes were found to be spatially ordered in a linear fashion. As a consequence, cells undergoing division evenly segregated carboxysomes in a nonrandom process. Mutation of the cytoskeletal protein ParA specifically disrupted carboxysome order, promoted random carboxysome segregation during cell division, and impaired carbon fixation after disparate partitioning. Thus, cyanobacteria use the cytoskeleton to control the spatial arrangement of carboxysomes and to optimize the metabolic process of carbon fixation.
Human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the fast-acting inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase and is a member of the serpin family of protease inhibitors. Serpins normally form complexes with their target proteases that dissociate very slowly as cleaved species and then fold into a highly stable inactive state in which the residues that flank the scissile bond (P1 and P1';) are separated by about 70 A. PAI-1 also spontaneously folds into a stable inactive state without cleavage; this state is termed 'latent' because inhibitory activity can be restored through denaturation and renaturation. Here we report the structure of intact latent PAI-1 determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction to 2.6 A resolution. The three-dimensional structure reveals that residues on the N-terminal side of the primary recognition site are inserted as a central strand of the largest beta sheet, in positions similar to the corresponding residues in the cleaved form of the serpin alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI). Residues C-terminal to the recognition site occupy positions on the surface of the molecule distinct from those of the corresponding residues in cleaved serpins or in the intact inactive serpin homologue, ovalbumin, and its cleavage product, plakalbumin. The structure of latent PAI-1 is similar to one formed after cleavage in other serpins, and the stability of both latent PAI-1 and cleaved serpins may be derived from the same structural features.
Fusion of viral and cellular membranes by the envelope glycoprotein gp120/gp41 effects entry of HIV-1 into the cell. The precursor, gp160, is cleaved post-translationally into gp120 and gp41 which remain non-covalently associated. Binding to both CD4 and a co-receptor leads to the conformational changes in gp120/gp41 needed for membrane fusion. We used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the protease-resistant part of a gp41 ectodomain solubilized with a trimeric GCN4 coiled coil in place of the amino-terminal fusion peptide. The core of the molecule is found to be an extended, triple-stranded alpha-helical coiled coil with the amino terminus at its tip. A carboxy-terminal alpha-helix packs in the reverse direction against the outside of the coiled coil, placing the amino and carboxy termini near each other at one end of the long rod. These features, and the existence of a similar reversal of chain direction in the fusion pH-induced conformation of influenza virus HA2 and in the transmembrane subunit of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (Fig. 1a-d), suggest a common mechanism for initiating fusion.
Human replication protein (RPA) functions in DNA replication, homologous recombination and nucleotide excision repair. This multisubunit single-stranded DNA-binding protein may be required to make unique protein-protein contacts because heterologous single-stranded binding proteins cannot substitute for RPA in these diverse DNA transactions. We report here that, by using affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, we found that human RPA bound specifically and directly to two excision repair proteins, the xeroderma pigmentosum damage-recognition protein XPA (refs 8, 9) and the endonuclease XPG (refs 10-13). Although it had been suggested that RPA might function before the DNA synthesis repair stage, our finding that a complex of RPA and XPA showed a striking cooperativity in binding to DNA lesions indicates that RPA may function at the very earliest stage of excision repair. In addition, by binding XPG, RPA may target this endonuclease to damaged DNA.
The enzyme complex nitrogenase, which reduces N2 to NH+4, involves two redox proteins, both irreversibly damaged by O2 (ref. 1). Enzyme activity therefore requires anaerobic conditions, a source of reductant and a large amount of ATP (approximately 16 ATPs per N2). In both aerobic and facultative anaerobic N2-fixing bacteria, nitrogenase synthesis is regulated by O2 and NH+4, but in the aerobes there are also processes to protect the enzyme from O2 damage. The mechanisms of repression by O2 and NH+4 seem to be independent in the organisms so far examined. In the facultative anaerobe, Klebsiella pneumoniae, O2 was shown to repress nitrogenase synthesis in an NH+4-constitutive strain. The fusion of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene into each transcriptional unit of the nitrogen fixation (nif) gene cluster in K. pneumoniae has facilitated studies with O2, because expression from the various nif promoters results in an O2-stable product (beta-galactosidase). Notably, the nifHDK operon (the nitrogenase structural genes) was more sensitive to O2 repression than the nifLA operon (regulatory genes). The characterization of mutants, reported here, indicates the involvement of a nif-regulatory gene product in the mechanism of O2 control of nitrogenase synthesis.
The mammalian heart rate is regulated by the vagus nerve, which acts via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to cause hyperpolarization of atrial pacemaker cells. The hyperpolarization is produced by the opening of potassium channels and involves an intermediary guanosine triphosphate-binding regulatory (G) protein. Potassium channels in isolated, inside-out patches of membranes from atrial cells now are shown to be activated by a purified pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein of subunit composition alpha beta gamma, with an alpha subunit of 40,000 daltons. Thus, mammalian atrial muscarinic potassium channels are activated directly by a G protein, not indirectly through a cascade of intermediary events. The G protein regulating these channels is identified as a potent Gk; it is active at 0.2 to 1 pM. Thus, proteins other than enzymes can be under control of receptor coupling G proteins.
Induction of cytochrome P1-450 has been linked to susceptibility to certain chemically induced cancers in mouse and man. Treatment of the human cell line MCF-7 with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) results in high levels of aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase (P1-450) activity. This cell line was used to isolate a human P1-450 full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) clone. The cDNA is 2566 nucleotides in length, encodes a polyadenylated messenger RNA (2.8 kilobases in length), and has a continuous reading frame producing a protein with 512 residues (molecular weight, 58,151). The human P1-450 cDNA and protein are 63 percent and 80 percent similar to mouse P1-450 cDNA and protein, respectively. Whereas the mouse TCDD-inducible P-450 gene subfamily has two members (P1-450 and P3-450), the human TCDD-inducible gene subfamily appears to have only one gene (P1-450).
A DNA-cell membrane complex has been isolated from cell suspensions of virulent pneumococci by sarcosyl lysis followed by centrifugation on a sucrose gradient. When polyadenylic acid plus the eight naturally occurring deoxyribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleotides are added to cell suspensions, the percentage of total DNA in the complex increases with incubation time. This increase is not observed in unsupplemented cell suspensions. However, the percentages of RNA, protein, and phospholipid do not increase with incubation time in either supplemented or control complexes. A variety of deoxyribonucleotide kinases and the DNA polymerase are also detected in the DNA-membrane complex, and their specific activities are greater in complexes extracted from supplemented cell suspensions than in those extracted from controls.
The role of conformational changes in explaining the huge catalytic power of enzymes is currently one of the most challenging questions in biology. Although it is now widely regarded that enzymes modulate reaction rates by means of short- and long-range protein motions, it is almost impossible to distinguish between conformational changes and catalysis. We have solved this problem using the chlorophyll biosynthetic enzyme NADPH:protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) oxidoreductase, which catalyses a unique light-driven reaction involving hydride and proton transfers. Here we report that prior excitation of the enzyme-substrate complex with a laser pulse induces a more favourable conformation of the active site, enabling the coupled hydride and proton transfer reactions to occur. This effect, which is triggered during the Pchlide excited-state lifetime and persists on a long timescale, switches the enzyme into an active state characterized by a high rate and quantum yield of formation of a catalytic intermediate. The corresponding spectral changes in the mid-infrared following the absorption of one photon reveal significant conformational changes in the enzyme, illustrating the importance of flexibility and dynamics in the structure of enzymes for their function.
DNA lesions interfere with DNA and RNA polymerase activity. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and photoproducts generated by ultraviolet irradiation cause stalling of RNA polymerase II, activation of transcription-coupled repair enzymes, and inhibition of RNA synthesis. During the S phase of the cell cycle, collision of replication forks with damaged DNA blocks ongoing DNA replication while also triggering a biochemical signal that suppresses the firing of distant origins of replication. Whether the transcription machinery is affected by the presence of DNA double-strand breaks remains a long-standing question. Here we monitor RNA polymerase I (Pol I) activity in mouse cells exposed to genotoxic stress and show that induction of DNA breaks leads to a transient repression in Pol I transcription. Surprisingly, we find Pol I inhibition is not itself the direct result of DNA damage but is mediated by ATM kinase activity and the repair factor proteins NBS1 (also known as NLRP2) and MDC1. Using live-cell imaging, laser micro-irradiation, and photobleaching technology we demonstrate that DNA lesions interfere with Pol I initiation complex assembly and lead to a premature displacement of elongating holoenzymes from ribosomal DNA. Our data reveal a novel ATM/NBS1/MDC1-dependent pathway that shuts down ribosomal gene transcription in response to chromosome breaks.
The particle-bound RNA polymerase activity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can be demonstrated in vivo. Linear synthesis of viral RNA persists for 5 to 6 hours at 34 degrees C in infected monolayers of chick embryo cells treated with cycloheximide and actinomycin D to block synthesis of protein and cell-specific RNA. At least 55 percent of the RNA made under these conditions is complementary to virion RNA. RNA synthesis mediated by VSV polymerase activity is inhibited in cells first treated with chick-derived interferon or polyriboinosinate* polyribocytidylate, but not by mouse interferon. The RNA product of VSV polymerase activity is present throughout the cytoplasm, and its synthesis is inhibited by the interferon system, as judged by autoradiographs that show the physical distribution, in cells, of RNA produced by virion polymerase in the absence of translation-a demonstration of the transcription product of the viral genome.
Tyrosine protein phosphorylation is necessary for antigen receptor-mediated activation of T lymphocytes. This signal is generated at least in part by the Src-related tyrosine protein kinases p56lck and p59fynT (refs 2, 3). The activity of these two enzymes is repressed by phosphorylation of a conserved carboxy-terminal tyrosine residue. Recent studies suggest that this inhibitory phosphorylation may be caused by p50csk (for C-terminal Src kinase), a tyrosine protein kinase which accumulates most abundantly in thymus and spleen. To investigate the function of Csk in T lymphocytes and characterize the processes regulating T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling, we examined the effects of overexpression of Csk on the physiology of an antigen-specific mouse T-cell line. We report here that p50csk negatively regulates TCR-induced tyrosine protein phosphorylation and lymphokine production. This provides evidence for the involvement of Csk in the regulation of T-cell activation.
The Escherichia coli guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins Ffh and FtsY have been proposed to catalyze the cotranslational targeting of proteins to the bacterial plasma membrane. A mutation was introduced into the GTP-binding domain of FtsY that altered its nucleotide specificity from GTP to xanthosine triphosphate (XTP). The mutant FtsY protein stimulated GTP hydrolysis by a ribonucleoprotein consisting of Ffh and 4.5S RNA in a reaction that required XTP, and it hydrolyzed XTP in a reaction that required both the Ffh-4.5S ribonucleoprotein and GTP. Thus, nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis by Ffh and FtsY is likely to occur in reciprocally coupled reactions in which the two interacting guanosine triphosphatases act as regulatory proteins for each other.
Expression of normal protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes in fibroblasts has been shown to alter growth regulation but has failed to induce complete transformation of the recipient cells. Here we report on a murine ultraviolet-induced fibrosarcoma cell line which has an unusual PKC subcellular distribution with 87% of the PKC activity associated with the membrane. We have cloned and sequenced the alpha-PKC complementary DNA from ultraviolet-induced-fibrosarcoma cells and from mouse Balb/c brain and found four point mutations in the fibrosarcoma PKC, of which three are in the highly conserved regulatory domain and one is in the conserved region of the catalytic domain. Expression of this mutant alpha-PKC gene in normal Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts results in a fibrosarcoma-like PKC membrane localization and in cell transformation, as judged by their formation of dense foci, anchorage-independent growth and ability to induce solid tumours when inoculated into nude mice. By contast, transfectants expressing the normal alpha-PKC cDNA do not display a morphology typical of malignant transformed cells and fail to induce tumours in vivo. These findings demonstrate that point mutations in the primary structure of PKC modulate enzyme function and are responsible for inducing oncogenicity.
Neuronal activity can lead to marked increases in the concentration of cytosolic calcium, which then functions as a second messenger that mediates a wide range of cellular responses. Calcium binds to calmodulin and stimulates the activity of a variety of enzymes, including calcium-calmodulin kinases and calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclases. These enzymes transduce the calcium signal and effect short-term biological responses, such as the modification of synaptic proteins and long-lasting neuronal responses that require changes in gene expression. Recent studies of calcium signal-transduction mechanisms have revealed that, depending on the route of entry into a neuron, calcium differentially affects processes that are central to the development and plasticity of the nervous system, including activity-dependent cell survival, modulation of synaptic strength, and calcium-mediated cell death.
Editing reactions are essential for the high fidelity of information transfer in processes such as replication, RNA splicing, and protein synthesis. The accuracy of interpretation of the genetic code is enhanced by the editing reactions of aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases, whereby amino acids are prevented from being attached to the wrong tRNAs. Amino acid discrimination is achieved through sieves that may overlap with or coincide with the amino acid binding site. With the class I Escherichia coli isoleucine tRNA synthetase, which activates isoleucine and occasionally misactivates valine, as an example, a rationally chosen mutant enzyme was constructed that lacks entirely its normal strong ability to distinguish valine from isoleucine by the initial amino acid recognition sieve. The misactivated valine, however, is still eliminated by hydrolytic editing reactions. These data suggest that there is a distinct sieve for editing that is functionally independent of the amino acid binding site.
The enzyme NADPH oxidase in phagocytes is important in the body's defence against microbes: it produces superoxide anions (O2-, precursors to bactericidal reactive oxygen species). Electrons move from intracellular NADPH, across a chain comprising FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) and two haems, to reduce extracellular O2 to O2-. NADPH oxidase is electrogenic, generating electron current (I(e)) that is measurable under voltage-clamp conditions. Here we report the complete current-voltage relationship of NADPH oxidase, the first such measurement of a plasma membrane electron transporter. We find that I(e) is voltage-independent from -100 mV to >0 mV, but is steeply inhibited by further depolarization, and is abolished at about +190 mV. It was proposed that H+ efflux mediated by voltage-gated proton channels compensates I(e), because Zn2+ and Cd2+ inhibit both H+ currents and O2- production. Here we show that COS-7 cells transfected with four NADPH oxidase components, but lacking H+ channels, produce O2- in the presence of Zn2+ concentrations that inhibit O2- production in neutrophils and eosinophils. Zn2+ does not inhibit NADPH oxidase directly, but through effects on H+ channels. H+ channels optimize NADPH oxidase function by preventing membrane depolarization to inhibitory voltages.
Glucokinase (GK) plays a key role in whole-body glucose homeostasis by catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose in cells that express this enzyme, such as pancreatic beta cells and hepatocytes. We describe a class of antidiabetic agents that act as nonessential, mixed-type GK activators (GKAs) that increase the glucose affinity and maximum velocity (Vmax) of GK. GKAs augment both hepatic glucose metabolism and glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated rodent pancreatic islets, consistent with the expression and function of GK in both cell types. In several rodent models of type 2 diabetes mellitus, GKAs lowered blood glucose levels, improved the results of glucose tolerance tests, and increased hepatic glucose uptake. These findings may lead to the development of new drug therapies for diabetes.
AB5 toxins are produced by pathogenic bacteria and consist of enzymatic A subunits that corrupt essential eukaryotic cell functions, and pentameric B subunits that mediate uptake into the target cell. AB5 toxins include the Shiga, cholera and pertussis toxins and a recently discovered fourth family, subtilase cytotoxin, which is produced by certain Shiga toxigenic strains of Escherichia coli. Here we show that the extreme cytotoxicity of this toxin for eukaryotic cells is due to a specific single-site cleavage of the essential endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP/GRP78. The A subunit is a subtilase-like serine protease; structural studies revealed an unusually deep active-site cleft, which accounts for its exquisite substrate specificity. A single amino-acid substitution in the BiP target site prevented cleavage, and co-expression of this resistant protein protected transfected cells against the toxin. BiP is a master regulator of endoplasmic reticulum function, and its cleavage by subtilase cytotoxin represents a previously unknown trigger for cell death.
Innate immunity in higher plants invokes a sophisticated surveillance system capable of recognizing bacterial effector proteins. In Arabidopsis, resistance to infection by strains of Pseudomonas syringae expressing the effector AvrRpt2 requires the plant resistance protein RPS2. AvrRpt2 was identified as a putative cysteine protease that results in the elimination of the Arabidopsis protein RIN4. RIN4 cleavage serves as a signal to activate RPS2-mediated resistance. AvrRpt2 is delivered into the plant cell, where it is activated by a eukaryotic factor that we identify as cyclophilin. This activation of AvrRpt2 is necessary for protease activity. Active AvrRpt2 can then directly cleave RIN4.
Platelets are small disc-shaped cell fragments which undergo a rapid transformation when they encounter vascular damage. They become more spherical and extrude pseudopodia, their fibrinogen receptors are activated, causing them to aggregate, they release their granule contents, and eventually form a plug which is responsible for primary haemostasis. Activation of platelets is also implicated in the pathogenesis of unstable angina, myocardial infarction and stroke. Here we show that platelets from mice deficient in the alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide-binding protein Gq are unresponsive to a variety of physiological platelet activators. As a result, G alpha(q)-deficient mice have increased bleeding times and are protected from collagen and adrenaline-induced thromboembolism. We conclude that G alpha(q) is essential for the signalling processes used by different platelet activators and that it cannot be replaced by G alpha(i) or the beta gamma subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins. G alpha(q) may thus be a new target for drugs designed to block the activation of platelets.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major pathogen in immunosuppressed individuals, including patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The nucleoside analogue ganciclovir (9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)-guanine) is one of the few drugs available to treat HCMV infections, but resistant virus is a growing problem in the clinic and there is a critical need for new drugs. The study of ganciclovir-resistant mutants has indicated that the selective action of ganciclovir depends largely on virus-controlled phosphorylation in HCMV-infected cells. The enzyme(s) responsible have not been identified. Here we report that the HCMV gene UL97, whose predicted product shares regions of homology with protein kinases, guanylyl cyclase and bacterial phosphotransferases, controls phosphorylation of ganciclovir in HCMV-infected cells. A four-amino-acid deletion of UL97 in a conserved region, which in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase participates in substrate recognition, causes impaired ganciclovir phosphorylation. The implications of these results for antiviral drug development and drug resistance are discussed.
V(D)J recombination generates diversity in the immune system through the lymphoid-specific assembly of multiple gene segments into functional immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. The first step in V(D)J recombination is cleavage of DNA at recombination signal sequences. Cleavage produces a blunt DNA end on each signal sequence and a hairpin end on adjacent coding gene segments, and can be reproduced in vitro by using purified RAG and RAG2 proteins. The later steps involve processing and joining of the cleaved DNA ends, and until now have been studied only in cells. Here we reconstitute the complete V(D)J recombination reaction in a cell-free system. We find that the RAG proteins are not only involved in cleavage, but are also needed in the later steps for efficient joining of coding ends. Joining is largely directed by short pieces of identical sequence in the coding flanks, but addition of human DNA ligase I results in greater diversity. Coding junctions contain short deletions as well as additions complementary to a coding flank (P nucleotides). Addition of non-templated nucleotides into coding junctions is mediated by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase. The cell-free reaction can therefore reproduce the complete set of processing events that occur in cells.
The purified p21src protein of Harvey sarcoma virus shows a guanine nucleotide-binding activity and, in addition, at elevated temperature an autophosphorylating activity at a threonine residue using as phosphoryl donor GTP or dGTP but not ATP or dATP. These biochemical activities are unique among those associated with transforming proteins of RNA-containing or DNA-containing tumour viruses.
Recent studies on the control of specific metabolic pathways in bacteria have documented the existence of entirely RNA-based mechanisms for controlling gene expression. These mechanisms involve the modulation of translation, transcription termination or RNA self-cleavage through the direct interaction of specific intracellular metabolites and RNA sequences. Here we show that an analogous RNA-based gene regulation system can effectively be designed for mammalian cells via the incorporation of sequences encoding self-cleaving RNA motifs into the transcriptional unit of a gene or vector. When correctly positioned, the sequences lead to potent inhibition of gene or vector expression, owing to the spontaneous cleavage of the RNA transcript. Administration of either oligonucleotides complementary to regions of the self-cleaving motif or a specific small molecule results in the efficient induction of gene expression, owing to inhibition of self-cleavage of the messenger RNA. Efficient regulation of transgene expression is shown in a variety of mammalian cell lines and live animals. In conjunction with other emerging technologies, this methodology may be particularly applicable to the development of gene regulation systems tailored to any small inducer molecule, and provide a novel means of biological sensing in vivo that may have an important application in the regulated delivery of protein therapeutics.
The baculovirus antiapoptotic protein p35 inhibited the proteolytic activity of human interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) and three of its homologs in enzymatic assays. Coexpression of p35 prevented the autoproteolytic activation of ICE from its precursor form and blocked ICE-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of enzymatic activity correlated with the cleavage of p35 and the formation of a stable ICE-p35 complex. The ability of p35 to block apoptosis in different pathways and in distantly related organisms suggests a central and conserved role for ICE-like proteases in the induction of apoptosis.
Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) internalize antigens and present antigen-derived peptides to T cells. Although APCs have been thought to exhibit a well-developed capacity for lysosomal proteolysis, here we found that they can exhibit two distinct strategies upon antigen encounter. Whereas macrophages contained high levels of lysosomal proteases and rapidly degraded internalized proteins, dendritic cells (DCs) and B lymphocytes were protease-poor, resulting in a limited capacity for lysosomal degradation. Consistent with these findings, DCs in vivo degraded internalized antigens slowly and thus retained antigen in lymphoid organs for extended periods. Limited lysosomal proteolysis also favored antigen presentation. These results help explain why DCs are able to efficiently accumulate, process, and disseminate antigens and microbes systemically for purposes of tolerance and immunity.
The three-dimensional structure of a 70-kilodalton amino terminally truncated form of human topoisomerase I in complex with a 22-base pair duplex oligonucleotide, determined to a resolution of 2.8 angstroms, reveals all of the structural elements of the enzyme that contact DNA. The linker region that connects the central core of the enzyme to the carboxyl-terminal domain assumes a coiled-coil configuration and protrudes away from the remainder of the enzyme. The positively charged DNA-proximal surface of the linker makes only a few contacts with the DNA downstream of the cleavage site. In combination with the crystal structures of the reconstituted human topoisomerase I before and after DNA cleavage, this information suggests which amino acid residues are involved in catalyzing phosphodiester bond breakage and religation. The structures also lead to the proposal that the topoisomerization step occurs by a mechanism termed "controlled rotation."
Immunoglobulin variable (V) gene regions typify extensive multigenic families in terms of overall size, chromosomal arrangement and presence of large numbers of apparent pseudogenes. A unique mechanism of somatic reorganization involving recombination of VH, D and JH or VL and JL segments accompanies the differentiation of lymphoid cells and together with somatic mutation and other types of recombination accounts for V-region diversity. Although these processes have been well characterized in higher mammals, little is known concerning their origin and diversification during phylogenetic time. Previously, we described the blot-hybridization characteristics of murine VHIII probes with restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA isolated from several phylogenetically critical species, including Caiman crocodylus, a modern representative of an ancient reptilian subclass. Here we have used a murine probe, S107V, to select homologous clones from a library of Caiman genomic DNA constructed in a lambda bacteriophage. The complete nucleotide sequence of a Caiman gene homologous to the murine VH gene and its adjacent 5' and 3' region is described. Comparison of the sequence with mammalian prototypes shows evidence of considerable organizational and structural homology extending outside the presumed VH-coding region and including elements believed to be involved in somatic recombination. Inferences about the evolution of this multigenic family can now be extended to the level of phylogenetic class.
Many bacteriophages and animal viruses integrate their genomes into the chromosomal DNA of their hosts as a method of promoting vertical transmission. Phages that integrate in a site-specific fashion encode an integrase enzyme that catalyses recombination between the phage and host genomes. CTX phi is a filamentous bacteriophage that contains the genes encoding cholera toxin, the principal virulence factor of the diarrhoea-causing Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. CTX phi integrates into the V. cholerae genome in a site-specific manner; however, the approximately 6.9-kilobase (kb) CTX phi genome does not encode any protein with significant homology to known recombinases. Here we report that XerC and XerD, two chromosome-encoded recombinases that ordinarily function to resolve chromosome dimers at the dif recombination site, are essential for CTX phi integration into the V. cholerae genome. The CTX phi integration site was found to overlap with the dif site of the larger of the two V. cholerae chromosomes. Examination of sequences of the integration sites of other filamentous phages indicates that the XerCD recombinases also mediate the integration of these phage genomes at dif-like sites in various bacterial species.
The molecular defects responsible for tumor cell hypermutability in humans have not yet been fully identified. Here the gene encoding a G/T mismatch-binding protein (GTBP) was localized to within 1 megabase of the related hMSH2 gene on chromosome 2 and was found to be inactivated in three hypermutable cell lines. Unlike cells defective in other mismatch repair genes, which display widespread alterations in mononucleotide, dinucleotide, and other simple repeated sequences, the GTBP-deficient cells showed alterations primarily in mononucleotide tracts. These results suggest that GTBP is important for maintaining the integrity of the human genome and document molecular defects accounting for variation in mutator phenotype.
The nucleolus is a key organelle that coordinates the synthesis and assembly of ribosomal subunits and forms in the nucleus around the repeated ribosomal gene clusters. Because the production of ribosomes is a major metabolic activity, the function of the nucleolus is tightly linked to cell growth and proliferation, and recent data suggest that the nucleolus also plays an important role in cell-cycle regulation, senescence and stress responses. Here, using mass-spectrometry-based organellar proteomics and stable isotope labelling, we perform a quantitative analysis of the proteome of human nucleoli. In vivo fluorescent imaging techniques are directly compared to endogenous protein changes measured by proteomics. We characterize the flux of 489 endogenous nucleolar proteins in response to three different metabolic inhibitors that each affect nucleolar morphology. Proteins that are stably associated, such as RNA polymerase I subunits and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle complexes, exit from or accumulate in the nucleolus with similar kinetics, whereas protein components of the large and small ribosomal subunits leave the nucleolus with markedly different kinetics. The data establish a quantitative proteomic approach for the temporal characterization of protein flux through cellular organelles and demonstrate that the nucleolar proteome changes significantly over time in response to changes in cellular growth conditions.
Several hundred million tons of toxic mercurials are dispersed in the biosphere. Microbes can detoxify organo-mercurials and mercury salts through sequential action of two enzymes, organomercury lyase and mercuric ion reductase (MerA). The latter, a homodimer with homology to the FAD-dependent disulphide oxidoreductases, catalyses the reaction NADPH + Hg(II)----NADP+ + H+ + Hg(0), one of the very rare enzymic reactions with metal substrates. Human glutathione reductase serves as a reference molecule for FAD-dependent disulphide reductases and between its primary structure and that of MerA from Tn501 (Pseudomonas), Tn21 (Shigella), p1258 (Staphylococcus) and Bacillus, 25-30% of the residues have been conserved. All MerAs have a C-terminal extension about 15 residues long but have very varied N termini. Although the enzyme from Streptomyces lividans has no addition, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Tn501 and Bacillus sp. strain RC607 it has one and two copies respectively of a domain of 80-85 residues, highly homologous to MerP, the periplasmic component of proteins encoded by the mer operon. These domains can be proteolytically cleaved off without changing the catalytic efficiency. We report here the crystal structure of MerA from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus sp. strain RC607. Analysis of its complexes with nicotinamide dinucleotide substrates and the inhibitor Cd(II) reveals how limited structural changes enable an enzyme to accept as substrate what used to be a dangerous inhibitor. Knowledge of the mode of mercury ligation is a prerequisite for understanding this unique detoxification mechanism.
Two forms of RNA polymerase holoenzyme have been identified in the filamentous differentiating bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. They contain different species of sigma factor and are distinguishable by their ability to recognize different promoter classes. These and other holoenzyme forms may in part determine the selective expression of different gene sets in this morphologically-complex bacterium.
Diacylglycerol analogues (for example 1,2-oleoylacetylglycerol, OAG) and phorbol esters are activators of protein kinase C, and have been widely used to study the function of this enzyme in both intact cells and cell-free preparations. Electrophysiological studies have shown that these activators can either depress or increase Ca2+ currents, or decrease K+ currents when applied outside the cell. It has been assumed that these effects are mediated by protein kinase C activation. Here we report that micromolar levels of OAG and phorbol esters depress Ca2+ currents in chick sensory neurons independently of their effect as activators of protein kinase C. The depression of the Ca2+ current is rapid and is unaffected by intracellular application of the protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporin, sphingosine and H-7. Furthermore, the activators were ineffective when applied intracellularly, indicating that their site of action is on the outside of the membrane.
The mechanisms by which enzymes achieve extraordinary rate acceleration and specificity have long been of key interest in biochemistry. It is generally recognized that substrate binding coupled to conformational changes of the substrate-enzyme complex aligns the reactive groups in an optimal environment for efficient chemistry. Although chemical mechanisms have been elucidated for many enzymes, the question of how enzymes achieve the catalytically competent state has only recently become approachable by experiment and computation. Here we show crystallographic evidence for conformational substates along the trajectory towards the catalytically competent 'closed' state in the ligand-free form of the enzyme adenylate kinase. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these partially closed conformations are sampled in nanoseconds, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveal rare sampling of a fully closed conformation occurring on the microsecond-to-millisecond timescale. Thus, the larger-scale motions in substrate-free adenylate kinase are not random, but preferentially follow the pathways that create the configuration capable of proficient chemistry. Such preferred directionality, encoded in the fold, may contribute to catalysis in many enzymes.
The structure of the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the precursor to mouse submaxillary epidermal growth factor (EGF) was determined from the sequence of a set of overlapping complementary DNA's (cDNA). The mRNA is unexpectedly large, about 4750 nucleotide bases, and predicts the sequence of preproEGF, a protein of 1217 amino acids (133,000 molecular weight). The EGF moiety (53 amino acids) is flanked by polypeptide segments of 976 and 188 amino acids at its amino and carboyxl termini, respectively. The amino terminal segment of the precursor contains seven peptides with sequences that are similar but not identical to EGF.
During the past two years, more than 1,000 cases of a neurological disorder of cattle, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), have been confirmed from farms throughout Great Britain. The neurological signs and brain pathology of BSE resemble those produced in other species by the pathogens of scrapie and related disorders. The discovery of fibrils similar to scrapie-associated fibrils in detergent extracts o BSE-affected brain supported the clinical and pathological diagnosis of the disease, but has been controversial. Scrapie-associated fibrils are found in brain extracts of all species affected by scrapie and diseases caused by related pathogens. They are pathological aggregates of a neuronal membrane protein termed PrP and a protease-resistant form of PrP is a molecular marker of scrapie-associated fibrils. In this report, we show the major protein of BSE fibrils is the bovine homologue of PrP as judged by its size, protease resistance, immunoreactivity, lectin binding and partial N-terminal protein sequence. This confirms that BSE is a scrapie-like disease.
To understand the molecular basis of microtubule-associated motility during mitosis, the mechanochemical factors that generate the relevant motile force must be identified. Myosin, the ATPase that interacts with actin to produce the force for muscle contraction and other forms of cell motility, is believed to be involved in cytokinesis but not in mitosis. Dynein, the mechanochemical enzyme that drives microtubule sliding in eukaryotic cilia and flagella, has been identified in the cytoplasm of sea urchin eggs, but the evidence that it is involved in cytoplasmic microtubule-based motility (rather than serving as a precursor for embryonic cilia) is equivocal. Microtubule-associated ATPases have been prepared from other tissues, but their role in cytoplasmic motility is also unknown. Recent work on axoplasmic transport, however, has led to the identification of a novel mechanochemical protein called kinesin, which is thought to generate the force for moving vesicles along axonal microtubules. These results suggest that kinesin may also be a mechanochemical factor for non-axoplasmic forms of microtubule-based motility, such as mitosis. We describe here the identification and isolation of a kinesin-like protein from the cytoplasm of sea urchin eggs. We present evidence that this protein is localized in the mitotic spindle, and propose that it may be a mechanochemical factor for some form of motility associated with the mitotic spindle.
The vascular complications of diabetes mellitus have been correlated with enhanced activation of protein kinase C (PKC). LY333531, a specific inhibitor of the beta isoform of PKC, was synthesized and was shown to be a competitive reversible inhibitor of PKC beta 1 and beta 2, with a half-maximal inhibitory constant of approximately 5 nM; this value was one-fiftieth of that for other PKC isoenzymes and one-thousandth of that for non-PKC kinases. When administered orally, LY333531 ameliorated the glomerular filtration rate, albumin excretion rate, and retinal circulation in diabetic rats in a dose-responsive manner, in parallel with its inhibition of PKC activities.
Homologous recombination has a crucial function in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and in faithful chromosome segregation. The mechanism of homologous recombination involves the search for homology and invasion of the ends of a broken DNA molecule into homologous duplex DNA to form a cross-stranded structure, a Holliday junction (HJ). A HJ is able to undergo branch migration along DNA, generating increasing or decreasing lengths of heteroduplex. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the physical evidence for HJs, the key intermediate in homologous recombination, was provided by electron microscopy. In bacteria there are specialized enzymes that promote branch migration of HJs. However, in eukaryotes the identity of homologous recombination branch-migration protein(s) has remained elusive. Here we show that Rad54, a Swi2/Snf2 protein, binds HJ-like structures with high specificity and promotes their bidirectional branch migration in an ATPase-dependent manner. The activity seemed to be conserved in human and yeast Rad54 orthologues. In vitro, Rad54 has been shown to stimulate DNA pairing of Rad51, a key homologous recombination protein. However, genetic data indicate that Rad54 protein might also act at later stages of homologous recombination, after Rad51 (ref. 13). Novel DNA branch-migration activity is fully consistent with this late homologous recombination function of Rad54 protein.
Sodium balance, and ultimately blood pressure and extracellular fluid volume, is maintained by precise regulation of the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). In a Xenopus kidney epithelial cell line (A6), exposure of the apical membrane to the protease inhibitor aprotinin reduces transepithelial sodium transport. Sodium-channel activity can be restored by subsequent exposure to the nonspecific protease trypsin. Using A6 cells and a functional complementation assay to detect increases in ENaC activity, we have cloned a 329-residue protein belonging to the serine protease family. We show that coexpression of this protein with ENaC in Xenopus oocytes increases the activity of the sodium channel by two- to threefold. This channel-activating protease (CAP1) is expressed in kidney, gut, lung, skin and ovary. Sequence analysis predicts that CAP1 is a secreted and/or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein: ENaC activity would thus be regulated by the activity of a protease expressed at the surface of the same cell. This previously undiscovered mechanism for autocrine regulation may apply to other ion channels, in particular to members of the ENaC family that are present in neurons and epithelial cells.
Phage T4 lysozyme consists of two domains between which is formed the active-site cleft of the enzyme. The crystallographically determined thermal displacement parameters for the protein suggested that the amino terminal of the two domains undergoes 'hinge-bending' motion about an axis passing through the waist of the molecule. Such conformational mobility may be important in allowing access of substrates to the active site of the enzyme. We report here a crystallographic study of a mutant T4 lysozyme which demonstrates further the conformational flexibility of the protein. A mutant form of the enzyme with a methionine residue (Met 6) replaced by isoleucine crystallizes with four independent molecules in the crystal lattice. These four molecules have distinctly different conformations. The mutant protein can also crystallize in standard form with a structure very similar to the wild-type protein. Thus the mutant protein can adopt five different crystal conformations. The isoleucine for methionine substitution at the intersection of the two domains of T4 lysozyme apparently enhances the hinge-bending motion presumed to occur in the wild-type protein, without significantly affecting the catalytic activity or thermal stability of the protein.
Peroxisomes are among the intracellular organelles of eukaryotic cells that contain specialized sets of enzymes with specific functions. Little is known of membranous components involved in assembly of the intracellular compartments. We isolated two peroxisome-deficient and mutually complementary, Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants, Z65 and Z24, which closely resembled fibroblasts from patients with autosomal recessive, peroxisome-defective disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. These patients show characteristic dysmorphism, severe hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, and peroxisomal dysfunctions and rarely survive early childhood. Here we report what seems to be the first direct cloning and characterization of a complementary DNA encoding a peroxisomal membrane protein of relative molecular mass 35,000 (Mr35K) that restores the biogenesis of peroxisomes and complements the defect of peroxisomal functions in the mutant Z65.
Catalytic antibodies have emerged as being without peer as rationally designed biocatalysts. They have been shown to catalyze an ever-increasing array of chemical reactions with both high substrate specificity and selectivity. Probing the immune repertoire, via an expanding number of techniques, has lead to the production of proteins that can catalyze chemistry that is both difficult to perform using existing chemical methods and that is not catalyzed by endogenous enzymes. Remarkably, recent evidence has pointed to a hitherto unknown catalytic function of all antibodies that seems to be intrinsic to their immunoglobulin structure, the conversion of 1O2* into H2O2. This new catalytic potential of antibodies points to a new 'chemical arm' of the immune system and reveals that the evolution of catalytic antibodies significantly predates their rational design.
The circadian clock is the central timing system that controls numerous physiological processes. In mammals, one such process is haem biosynthesis, which the clock controls through regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme aminolevulinate synthase 1 (Alas1). Several members of the core clock mechanism are PAS domain proteins, one of which, neuronal PAS 2 (NPAS2), has a haem-binding motif. Indeed, haem controls activity of the BMAL1-NPAS2 transcription complex in vitro by inhibiting DNA binding in response to carbon monoxide. Here we show that haem differentially modulates expression of the mammalian Period genes mPer1 and mPer2 in vivo by a mechanism involving NPAS2 and mPER2. Further experiments show that mPER2 positively stimulates activity of the BMAL1-NPAS2 transcription complex and, in turn, NPAS2 transcriptionally regulates Alas1. Vitamin B12 and haem compete for binding to NPAS2 and mPER2, but they have opposite effects on mPer2 and mPer1 expression in vivo. Our data show that the circadian clock and haem biosynthesis are reciprocally regulated and suggest that porphyrin-containing molecules are potential targets for therapy of circadian disorders.
Membrane receptors for blood proteases govern the clotting and fibrinolytic cascades, regulate signal transduction and control the growth of mesenchymal cells. Despite their importance in the development of vascular injury, it is unclear whether these mechanisms participate in the generation of an immune response. Here we report that targeting a factor Xa receptor, designated effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1), with antisense oligonucleotide or with a monoclonal antibody (mAB 2E1) inhibited CD3/T-cell receptor-dependent lymphocyte proliferation. Immunosuppression was mediated by abolishing cytokine production and down-modulating membrane expression of the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor. In vivo administration of mAb 2E1 to severe-combined-immunodeficient mice injected with human peripheral blood leukocytes suppressed production of human immunoglobulin, abolished graft-versus-host disease, and protected these xenochimaeric mice from Epstein-Barr-virus-induced human lymphoproliferative disease. These observations indicate a new role for protease receptors in the regulation of the immune response, and identify a potential target for therapeutic immunosuppression in humans.
Genetic information can be altered through the enzymatic modification of nucleotide sequences. This process, known as editing, was originally identified in the mitochondrial RNA of trypanosomes and later found to condition events as diverse as neurotransmission and lipid metabolism in mammals. Recent evidence reveals that editing enzymes may fulfill one of their most essential roles in the defense against infectious agents: first, as the mediators of antibody diversification, a step crucial for building adaptive immunity, and second, as potent intracellular poisons for the replication of viruses. Exciting questions are raised, which take us to the depth of the intimate relations between vertebrates and the microbial underworld.
Kinins are naturally occurring vasoactive polypeptides thought to be mediators of acute inflammatory responses. Kinins are released from a plasma protein substrate by glass-activated plasma enzymes (kallikreins) or by isolated intact granulocytes. Cortisol in concentrations of 2.5 x 10(-6) to 2.5 x 10(-5)M prevented the release of active kinin from substrate by granulocytes or contact with glass. Deoxycorticosterone, progesterone, and etiocholanolone in comparable concentrations were significantly less effective in preventing kinin release. Plasma obtained from patients receiving prednisone released no kinin after activation by glass and less kinin than control plasma when exposed to granulocytes. Cortisol also partially inhibited the release of kinin by purified urinary kallikrein. Certain adrenocorticosteroids may exert their anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the release of plasma kinins. Steroids may act in part by preventing interaction between the activated kallikrein and its substrate.
The history of the molecular revolution in biology is described, emphasizing its dependence on the emergence of bacterial genetics, the fusion of genetics and biochemistry, and the development of greatly improved techniques for studying macromolecules. Central concepts have included molecular information transfer, both by nucleic acids and by allosteric proteins; the spontaneous conversion of one-dimensional information into three-dimensional structures; and the extraordinary unity in the molecular mechanisms underlying the rich diversity of biology. The merging of molecular and morphological studies, to yield the very broad field of cell biology, is described more briefly, as are also some present frontiers in several areas of biology that present challenges at other levels of organization.
The mammalian cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase system is involved in the metabolism of drugs and chemical carcinogens. The role of these enzymes in toxicological response is exemplified by an autosomal recessive polymorphism at the cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 debrisoquine hydroxylase locus which results in the severely compromised metabolism of at least 25 drugs, and which in some cases can lead to life-threatening side-effects. In addition, this polymorphism, which affects 8-10% of the caucasian population, has been associated with altered susceptibility to lung and bladder cancer. Here we report the identification of the primary mutation responsible for this metabolic defect and the development of a simple DNA-based genetic assay to allow both the identification of most individuals at risk of drug side-effects and clarification of the conflicting reports on the association of this polymorphism with cancer susceptibility.
Many of the actions of receptor tyrosine kinases are mediated by the protein Ras, including the activation of various downstream serine/threonine kinases and the stimulation of growth and differentiation. The human protein Grb2 binds to ligand-activated growth factor receptors and downstream effector proteins through its Src-homology (SH) domains SH2 and SH3, respectively, and like its homologue from Caenorhabditis elegans, Sem-5, apparently forms part of a highly conserved pathway by which these receptors can control Ras activity. Here we show that the SH3 domains of Grb2 bind to the carboxy-terminal part of hSos1, the human homologue of the Drosophila guanine-nucleotide-releasing factor for Ras, which is essential for control of Ras activity by epidermal growth factor receptor and sevenless. Moreover, a synthetic 10-amino-acid peptide containing the sequence PPVPPR specifically blocks the interaction. These results indicate that the Grb2/hSos1 complex couples activated EGF receptor to Ras signalling.
Q beta replicase, in the absence of added template, will synthesize RNA autocatalytically. A variety of small RNa species, termed '6S RNAs' are generated. As this reaction purportedly occurs in the absence of template, it has been termed 'de novo' RNA synthesis. The question of whether Q beta replicase can polymerize replicatable RNA molecules, without instruction from a template, has important evolutionary implications. The finding that Q beta replicase was able to synthesize RNA de novo was based on (1) failure to find contaminating RNA in Q beta replicase preparations; (2) differences in the sizes of products of apparently identical reactions; and (3) kinetic differences between template-instructed and de novo reactions. Here wer describe a procedure for production of Q beta replicase lacking one of its subunits, ribosomal protein S1, involving column chromatography in the presence of a low concentration of urea. We show that the resulting highly purified enzyme will not synthesize detectable RNA in the absence of added template. We show also that the ability to perform a reaction kinetically indistinguishable from the de novo synthesis reaction can be restored to the highly purified enzyme by adding a heat-stable, alkali-labile component of Q beta replicase preparations. Thus our findings suggest that, in the novo reaction, Q beta replicase is replicating previously undetected contaminating RNA molecules.
The 77-residue propeptide of subtilisin acts as an intramolecular chaperone that organizes the correct folding of its own protease domain. Similar folding mechanisms are used by several prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, including prohormone-convertases. Here we show that the intramolecular chaperone of subtilisin facilitates folding by acting as a template for its protease domain, although it does not form part of that domain. Subtilisin E folded by an intramolecular chaperone with an Ile(-48)-to-Val mutation acquires an 'altered' enzymatically active conformation that differs from wild-type subtilisin E. Although both the altered and wild-type subtilisins have identical amino-acid sequences, as determined by amino-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry, they bind their cognate intramolecular chaperones with 4.5-fold greater affinity than non-cognate intramolecular chaperones, when added in trans. The two subtilisins also have different secondary structures, thermostability and substrate specificities. Our results indicate that an identical polypeptide can fold into an altered conformation through a mutated intramolecular chaperone and maintains memory of the folding process. Such a phenomenon, which we term 'protein memory', may be important in investigations of protein folding.
Negative-strand RNA viruses condense their genome into a helical nucleoprotein-RNA complex, the nucleocapsid, which is packed into virions and serves as a template for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex. The crystal structure of a recombinant rabies virus nucleoprotein-RNA complex, organized in an undecameric ring, has been determined at 3.5 angstrom resolution. Polymerization of the nucleoprotein is achieved by domain exchange between protomers, with flexible hinges allowing nucleocapsid formation. The two core domains of the nucleoprotein clamp around the RNA at their interface and shield it from the environment. RNA sequestering by nucleoproteins is likely a common mechanism used by negative-strand RNA viruses to protect their genomes from the innate immune response directed against viral RNA in human host cells at certain stages of an infectious cycle.
The nucleotide sequence of the entire histidine transport operon from Salmonella typhimurium has been determined and is shown to consist of four genes, hisJ, hisQ, hisM and hisP. This operon provides the only example of a binding protein-dependent transport system for which the total number of protein components is known. Determination of the amino acid compositions and sequences of these four transport proteins, together with analysis of various transport mutants, allows us to propose a molecular model for binding protein-dependent transport.
Mispairs in DNA of guanine with uracil and thymine can arise as a result of deamination of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine, respectively. In humans such mispairs are removed by thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG). By deleting the carboxy and amino termini of this enzyme we have identified a core region capable of processing G/U but not G/T mispairs. We have further identified two bacterial proteins with strong sequence homology to this core and shown that the homologue from Escherichia coli (dsUDG) can remove uracil from G/U mispairs. This enzyme is likely to act as a back-up to the highly efficient and abundant enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) which is found in most organisms. Pupating insects have been reported to lack UDG activity, but we have identified an enzyme similar to dsUDG in cell lines from three different insect species. These data imply the existence of a family of double-strand-specific uracil-DNA glycosylases which, although they are subservient to UDG in most organisms, may constitute the first line of defence against the mutagenic effects of cytosine deamination in insects.
Ubiquitination of proteins involves the concerted action of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. It has been proposed that E3s function as 'docking proteins', specifically binding substrate proteins and specific E2s, and that ubiquitin is then transferred directly from E2s to substrates. We show here that formation of a ubiquitin thioester on E6-AP, an E3 involved in the human papillomavirus E6-induced ubiquitination of p53 (refs 6-10), is an intermediate step in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination. The order of ubiquitin transfer is from E1 to E2, from E2 to E6-AP, and finally from E6-AP to a substrate. This cascade of ubiquitin thioester complexes suggests that E3s have a defined enzymatic activity and do not function simply as docking proteins. The cysteine residue of E6-AP responsible for ubiquitin thioester formation was mapped to a region that is highly conserved among several proteins of unknown function, suggesting that these proteins share the ability to form thioesters with ubiquitin.
The Ntn (N-terminal nucleophile) hydrolases are enzymes with an unusual four-layer alpha + beta fold. The amino-terminal residue (cysteine, serine or threonine) of the mature protein is the catalytic nucleophile, and its side chain is activated for nucleophilic attack by transfer of its proton to the free N terminus, although other active-site residues may also be involved. The four currently known Ntn hydrolases (glutamine PRPP amidotransferase, penicillin acylase, the 20S proteasome and aspartylglucosaminidase) are encoded as inactive precursors, and are activated by cleavage of the peptide bond preceding the catalytic residue. It has been suggested that autocatalytic processing is a common feature of Ntn hydrolases, and proceeds by an intramolecular mechanism determined by their common fold. Here we show that propeptide processing in the proteasome from Thermoplasma acidophilum is indeed autocatalytic, but is probably intermolecular. Processing is not required for assembly, is largely unaffected by propeptide length and sequence, and occurs before beta-subunit folding is completed. Although serine is an acceptable active-site nucleophile for proteolysis, and cysteine for processing, only threonine is fully functional in both. This explains why threonine is universally conserved in active proteasome subunits.
After fertilization of the sea urchin egg the rate of protein synthesis by a cell-free ribosomal system increases markedly. This increase can be attributed to newly synthesized messenger RNA, since (i) the rate of polypeptide synthesis elicited by synthetic messenger polyribonucleotides changes only slightly after fertilization, and (ii) the enzymes for the formation of amino acyl transfer RNA's of phenylalanine and leucine and the polymerization of polypeptide are in excess in the unfertilized egg. Polypeptide synthesis has been characterized in development to the gastrula stage.
Dynamic changes in microtubule (MT) length have long been thought to contribute to intracellular motility. Both the polymerization and depolymerization of tubulin have been shown to do work in vitro, but the biochemical complexity of objects moved, such as chromosomes, has complicated the identification of proteins that couple MT dynamics with motility. Work with MTs grown from and tethered to pellicles of lysed Tetrahymena has shown that disassembly-dependent movement of chromosomes in vitro can be inhibited with antibodies against the motor domain of kinesin. To study proteins that can function in disassembly-dependent motion, we have refined this motility assay, replacing chromosomes with protein-coated latex microspheres. We report here the ability of several enzymes, including kinesin, to support in vitro motility of latex microspheres on disassembling MTs (Fig. 1a). The polarity of kinesin's motor activity can be reversed by MT disassembly and interactions between a motor and a MT end can either slow or speed the rate of tubulin depolymerization.
The ras proto-oncogene products are plasma membrane-bound, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins implicated in signal transduction across the plasma membrane. But the signal(s) that activates the ras pathway(s) is not known. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the CDC25 gene product acts upstream of Ras proteins, but it has not been clear whether CDC25 function is unique to the S. cerevisiae ras pathway. Here we report that the ste6 gene of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a homologue of CDC25: the ste6 gene product and the CDC25 gene product have significant amino-acid similarity in their C-terminal regions. Like the S. pombe ras1 gene, ste6 is essential for mating. Epistatic interactions indicate that the ste6 gene functions upstream of ras1. We propose that ste6 and CDC25 activate Ras protein through a common mechanism, perhaps by promoting GDP-GTP exchange, even though it seems that the function of Ras protein in budding yeast differs from that in fission yeast. Homologues of ste6 and CDC25 could regulate ras activity in other eukaryotic cells.
Since the introduction of gel electrophoresis to population genetics, estimates of genic heterozygosity at allozyme loci have been made for many organisms. However, attempts to extend the range of proteins surveyed have been hampered by concern that there may have been bias in the loci sampled: nearly all proteins for which population data are available are soluble in low-salt extracts and most are enzymes belonging to particular groups such as the nonspecific esterases and phosphatases, various dehydrogenases and the enzymes of the glycolytic pathways and the citric acid cycle. Until recently, there were no techniques for estimating protein variation which were without such bias. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, however, offered hope of overcoming this bias, and it has proved useful for the resolution of proteins in crude homogenates and for estimating genetic variation. We have examined heterozygosity in a wild population of the house mouse (Mus musculus) by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis of whole kidney. As we report here, the observed level (2%) is substantially below the level detected by starch gel electrophoresis. Our results corroborate similar differences observed in Drosophila and man.
Classical yeast genetics coupled with the cloning of regulatory genes by complementation of function is a powerful means of identifying and isolating trans-acting regulatory elements. One such regulatory gene is ADR1 which encodes a protein required for transcriptional activation of the glucose-repressible alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2) gene. We now report the nucleotide sequence of ADR1; it encodes a polypeptide chain of 1,323 amino acids, of which the amino-terminal 302 amino acids are sufficient to stimulate ADH2 transcription. This active amino-terminal region shows amino-acid sequence homology with the repetitive DNA-binding domain of TFIIIA, an RNA polymerase III transcription factor of Xenopus laevis. Similar domains are found in proteins encoded at the Kruppel and Serendipity loci of Drosophila melanogaster. We discuss the implications of this structural homology and suggest that a similar domain may exist in other yeast regulatory proteins such as those encoded by GAL4 (ref. 13) and PPR1 (ref.14).
Signaling by the Notch surface receptor controls cell fate determination in a broad spectrum of tissues. This signaling is triggered by the interaction of the Notch protein with what, so far, have been thought to be transmembrane ligands expressed on adjacent cells. Here biochemical and genetic analyses show that the ligand Delta is cleaved on the surface, releasing an extracellular fragment capable of binding to Notch and acting as an agonist of Notch activity. The ADAM disintegrin metalloprotease Kuzbanian is required for this processing event. These observations raise the possibility that Notch signaling in vivo is modulated by soluble forms of the Notch ligands.
Dystrophin is the protein product of the Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy locus. It has a relative molecular mass of 427,000 and is encoded by a large RNA transcript processed from more than 65 exons spread over two million base pairs of the human X chromosome. We have used the polymerase chain reaction to see whether any of these exons are used alternatively in the different tissues that express dystrophin. As reported for rat dystrophin, we find that the first exons of the human dystrophin transcript is different in brain and muscle, indicating that dystrophin expression could be differentially regulated in these tissues by usage of distinct promoters. The 3' end of the dystrophin transcript can be alternatively spliced to create numerous isoforms differing at their carboxyl domains; this is the only domain of dystrophin that does not share any similarity with the related cytoskeletal alpha-actinins. These alternative transcripts yield dystrophin molecules which may interact with different proteins of the tissues expressing dystrophin.
Potassium channels comprise a diverse class of ion channels important for neuronal excitability and plasticity. The recent cloning of the Shaker locus from Drosophila melanogaster has provided a starting point for molecular studies of potassium channels. Predicted Shaker proteins appear to be integral membrane proteins and have a sequence similar to the sequence of the S4 segment of the vertebrate sodium channel, where the S4 segment has been proposed to be the voltage sensor. Expression studies in frog oocytes confirm that Shaker encodes a component of a potassium channel (the A channel) that conducts a fast transient potassium current. Here we report the isolation of complementary DNA clones from the mouse brain, the nucleotide sequences of which predict a protein remarkably similar to the Shaker protein. The strong conservation of the predicted protein sequence in flies and mammals suggests that these mouse clones encode a potassium channel component and that the conserved amino acids may be essential to some aspect of potassium channel function.
Transcription of the HO gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes a site-specific endonuclease that initiates cell-type switching (reviewed in refs. 1,2), is restricted to a short window of the cell cycle in late G1 (refs 3,4). A repeated element in the upstream region of HO (the cell-cycle box, CCB) and two regulatory proteins, SWI4 and SWI6, are required for cell-cycle-dependent expression of HO. Biochemical experiments have identified a factor, CCBF (cell-cycle box factor), that binds to the CCB elements and that presumably plays a key part in cell-cycle regulation of HO. The SWI4 and SWI6 genes are required for formation of the CCBF-DNA complex. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of the SWI4 gene and show that it contains two copies of the conserved SWI6-cdc10 motif observed in SWI6 of budding yeast, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc10 gene required for progression through G19, the Drosophila Notch gene, and in the Caenorhabditis elegans lin-12 and glp-1 genes. We demonstrate by using antibodies to the SWI4 protein in gel-shift assays that the protein is present in the CCBF-DNA complex.
The cysteinyl leukotrienes, namely leukotriene (LT)C4 and its metabolites LTD4 and LTE4, the components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis, are lipid mediators of smooth muscle constriction and inflammation, particularly implicated in bronchial asthma. LTC4 synthase (LTC4S), the pivotal enzyme for the biosynthesis of LTC4 (ref. 10), is an 18-kDa integral nuclear membrane protein that belongs to a superfamily of membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism that includes 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, microsomal glutathione S-transferases (MGSTs), and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (ref. 13). LTC4S conjugates glutathione to LTA4, the endogenous substrate derived from arachidonic acid through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. In contrast with MGST2 and MGST3 (refs 15, 16), LTC4S does not conjugate glutathione to xenobiotics. Here we show the atomic structure of human LTC4S in a complex with glutathione at 3.3 A resolution by X-ray crystallography and provide insights into the high substrate specificity for glutathione and LTA4 that distinguishes LTC4S from other MGSTs. The LTC4S monomer has four transmembrane alpha-helices and forms a threefold symmetric trimer as a unit with functional domains across each interface. Glutathione resides in a U-shaped conformation within an interface between adjacent monomers, and this binding is stabilized by a loop structure at the top of the interface. LTA4 would fit into the interface so that Arg 104 of one monomer activates glutathione to provide the thiolate anion that attacks C6 of LTA4 to form a thioether bond, and Arg 31 in the neighbouring monomer donates a proton to form a hydroxyl group at C5, resulting in 5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S-glutathionyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTC4). These findings provide a structural basis for the development of LTC4S inhibitors for a proinflammatory pathway mediated by three cysteinyl leukotriene ligands whose stability and potency are different and by multiple cysteinyl leukotriene receptors whose functions may be non-redundant.
A superfamily of DNA polymerases that bypass lesions in DNA has been described. Some family members are described as error-prone because mutations that inactivate the polymerase reduce damage-induced mutagenesis. In contrast, mutations in the skin cancer susceptibility gene XPV, which encodes DNA polymerase (pol)-eta, lead to increased ultraviolet-induced mutagenesis. This, and the fact that pol-eta primarily inserts adenines during efficient bypass of thymine-thymine dimers in vitro, has led to the description of pol-eta as error-free. However, here we show that human pol-eta copies undamaged DNA with much lower fidelity than any other template-dependent DNA polymerase studied. Pol-eta lacks an intrinsic proofreading exonuclease activity and, depending on the mismatch, makes one base substitution error for every 18 to 380 nucleotides synthesized. This very low fidelity indicates a relaxed requirement for correct base pairing geometry and indicates that the function of pol-eta may be tightly controlled to prevent potentially mutagenic DNA synthesis.
Hexameric ring-shaped ATPases of the AAA + (for ATPases associated with various cellular activities) superfamily power cellular processes in which macromolecular structures and complexes are dismantled or denatured, but the mechanisms used by these machine-like enzymes are poorly understood. By covalently linking active and inactive subunits of the ATPase ClpX to form hexamers, here we show that diverse geometric arrangements can support the enzymatic unfolding of protein substrates and translocation of the denatured polypeptide into the ClpP peptidase for degradation. These studies indicate that the ClpX power stroke is generated by ATP hydrolysis in a single subunit, rule out concerted and strict sequential ATP hydrolysis models, and provide evidence for a probabilistic sequence of nucleotide hydrolysis. This mechanism would allow any ClpX subunit in contact with a translocating polypeptide to hydrolyse ATP to drive substrate spooling into ClpP, and would prevent stalling if one subunit failed to bind or hydrolyse ATP. Energy-dependent machines with highly diverse quaternary architectures and molecular functions could operate by similar asymmetric mechanisms.
The universality of ribonuclease P (RNase P), the ribonucleoprotein essential for transfer RNA (tRNA) 5' maturation, is challenged in the archaeon Nanoarchaeum equitans. Neither extensive computational analysis of the genome nor biochemical tests in cell extracts revealed the existence of this enzyme. Here we show that the conserved placement of its tRNA gene promoters allows the synthesis of leaderless tRNAs, whose presence was verified by the observation of 5' triphosphorylated mature tRNA species. Initiation of tRNA gene transcription requires a purine, which coincides with the finding that tRNAs with a cytosine in position 1 display unusually extended 5' termini with an extra purine residue. These tRNAs were shown to be substrates for their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. These findings demonstrate how nature can cope with the loss of the universal and supposedly ancient RNase P through genomic rearrangement at tRNA genes under the pressure of genome condensation.
Molecular self-assembly offers a means of spontaneously forming complex and well-defined structures from simple components. The specific bonding between DNA base pairs has been used in this way to create DNA-based nanostructures and to direct the assembly of material on the subnanometre to micrometre scale. In principle, large-scale clonal production of suitable DNA sequences and the directed evolution of sequence lineages towards optimized behaviour can be realized through exponential DNA amplification by polymerases. But known examples of three-dimensional geometric DNA objects are not amenable to cloning because they contain topologies that prevent copying by polymerases. Here we report the design and synthesis of a 1,669-nucleotide, single-stranded DNA molecule that is readily amplified by polymerases and that, in the presence of five 40-mer synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, folds into an octahedron structure by a simple denaturation-renaturation procedure. We use cryo-electron microscopy to show that the DNA strands fold successfully, with 12 struts or edges joined at six four-way junctions to form hollow octahedra approximately 22 nanometres in diameter. Because the base-pair sequence of individual struts is not repeated in a given octahedron, each strut is uniquely addressable by the appropriate sequence-specific DNA binder.
A new method has been developed that makes it possible to site-specifically incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins. Synthetic amino acids were incorporated into the enzyme beta-lactamase by the use of a chemically acylated suppressor transfer RNA that inserted the amino acid in response to a stop codon substituted for the codon encoding residue of interest. Peptide mapping localized the inserted amino acid to a single peptide, and enough enzyme could be generated for purification to homogeneity. The catalytic properties of several mutants at the conserved Phe66 were characterized. The ability to selectively replace amino acids in a protein with a wide variety of structural and electronic variants should provide a more detailed understanding of protein structure and function.
Chronic granulomatous diseases (CGDs) are characterized by recurrent infections resulting from impaired superoxide production by a phagocytic cell, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH) oxidase. Complementary DNAs were cloned that encode the 67-kilodalton (kD) cytosolic oxidase factor (p67), which is deficient in 5% of CGD patients. Recombinant p67 (r-p67) partially restored NADPH oxidase activity to p67-deficient neutrophil cytosol from these patients. The p67 cDNA encodes a 526-amino acid protein with acidic middle and carboxyl-terminal domains that are similar to a sequence motif found in the noncatalytic domain of src-related tyrosine kinases. This motif was recently noted in phospholipase C-gamma, nonerythroid alpha-spectrin (fodrin), p21ras-guanosine triphophatase-activating protein (GAP), myosin-1 isoforms, yeast proteins cdc-25 and fus-1, and the 47-kD phagocyte oxidase factor (p47), which suggests the possibility of common regulatory features.
The regulation of fat and glucose metabolism in the liver is controlled primarily by insulin and glucagon. Changes in the circulating concentrations of these hormones signal fed or starvation states and elicit counter-regulatory responses that maintain normoglycaemia. Here we show that in normal mice, plasma insulin inhibits the forkhead transcription factor Foxa2 by nuclear exclusion and that in the fasted (low insulin) state Foxa2 activates transcriptional programmes of lipid metabolism and ketogenesis. In insulin-resistant or hyperinsulinaemic mice, Foxa2 is inactive and permanently located in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. In these mice, adenoviral expression of Foxa2T156A, a nuclear, constitutively active Foxa2 that cannot be inhibited by insulin, decreases hepatic triglyceride content, increases hepatic insulin sensitivity, reduces glucose production, normalizes plasma glucose and significantly lowers plasma insulin. These changes are associated with increased expression of genes encoding enzymes of fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis and glycolysis. Chronic hyperinsulinaemia in insulin-resistant syndromes results in the cytoplasmic localization and inactivation of Foxa2, thereby promoting lipid accumulation and insulin resistance in the liver. Pharmacological intervention to inhibit phosphorylation of Foxa2 may be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes.
Biosensors are molecular sensors that combine a biological recognition mechanism with a physical transduction technique. They provide a new class of inexpensive, portable instrument that permit sophisticated analytical measurements to be undertaken rapidly at decentralized locations. However, the adoption of biosensors for practical applications other than the measurement of blood glucose is currently limited by the expense, insensitivity and inflexibility of the available transduction methods. Here we describe the development of a biosensing technique in which the conductance of a population of molecular ion channels is switched by the recognition event. The approach mimics biological sensory functions and can be used with most types of receptor, including antibodies and nucleotides. The technique is very flexible and even in its simplest form it is sensitive to picomolar concentrations of proteins. The sensor is essentially an impedance element whose dimensions can readily be reduced to become an integral component of a microelectronic circuit. It may be used in a wide range of applications and in complex media, including blood. These uses might include cell typing, the detection of large proteins, viruses, antibodies, DNA, electrolytes, drugs, pesticides and other low-molecular-weight compounds.
Chaperonins GroEL and GroES form two types of hetero-oligomers in vitro that can mediate the folding of proteins. Chemical cross-linking and electron microscopy showed that in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), two GroES7 rings can successively bind a single GroEL14 core oligomer. The symmetric GroEL14(GroES7)2 chaperonin, whose central cavity appears obstructed by two GroES7 rings, can nonetheless stably bind and assist the ATP-dependent refolding of RuBisCO enzyme. Thus, unfolded proteins first bind and possibly fold on the external envelope of the chaperonin hetero-oligomer.
RNA polymerase (Pol) II catalyses DNA-dependent RNA synthesis during gene transcription. There is, however, evidence that Pol II also possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template, can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA, and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids. Here we show the intrinsic RdRP activity of Pol II with only pure polymerase, an RNA template-product scaffold and nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Crystallography reveals the template-product duplex in the site occupied by the DNA-RNA hybrid during transcription. RdRP activity resides at the active site used during transcription, but it is slower and less processive than DNA-dependent activity. RdRP activity is also obtained with part of the HDV antigenome. The complex of transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) with Pol II can cleave one HDV strand, create a reactive stem-loop in the hybrid site, and extend the new RNA 3' end. Short RNA stem-loops with a 5' extension suffice for activity, but their growth to a critical length apparently impairs processivity. The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes.
The data discussed herein demonstrate the great variation in target-tissue response that can occur after administration of steroid hormones. The female sex steroids can exert regulatory effects on the synthesis, activity, and possibly even the degradation of tissue enzymes and structural proteins. Each response, nevertheless, appears to be dependent on the synthesis of nuclear RNA. In many instances, the steroid actually promotes a qualitative change in the base composition and sequence of the RNA synthesized by the target cell, implying a specific effect on gene transcription. Most important is our direct quantitative evidence that sex steroids cause a net increase in the intracellular amounts of specific mRNA molecules in target tissues. It thus appears that we are discovering a pattern of steroid hormone action which includes (Fig. 1): (i) uptake of the hormone by the target cell and binding to a specific cytoplasmic receptor protein; (ii) transport of the steroid-receptor complex to the nucleus; (iii) binding of this "active" complex to specific "acceptor" sites on the genome (chromatin DNA and acidic protein); (iv) activation of the transcriptional apparatus resulting in the appearance of new RNA species which includes specific mRNA's; (v) transport of the hormone-induced RNA to the cytoplasm resulting in synthesis of new proteins on cytoplasmic ribosomes; and (vi) the occurrence of the specific steroid-mediated "functional response" characteristic of that particular target tissue. To elucidate fully the mechanism of steroid hormone action we must study the biochemistry of the process by which information held by the steroid hormone-receptor complex is transferred to the nuclear transcription apparatus. If our assumptions are correct, we should ultimately be able to discover how this hormone-receptor complex exerts a specific regulatory effect on nuclear RNA metabolism. Such regulation might be achieved (i) by direct effects on chromatin template leading to increased gene transcription and thus RNA synthesis; (ii) by activation of the polymerase complex itself; (iii) by inhibition of RNA breakdown; or (iv) by intranuclear processing of large precursor molecules so that smaller biologically active sequences are produced, and (v) by transport of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic sites of cellular protein synthesis.
The mechanisms by which interferon inhibits viral growth are only partially understood. Several enzymatic activities increase in cells shortly after treatment with interferon. One of these enzymes, oligo-isoadenylate synthetase, synthesizes (2'-5') isoadenylate oligomers which strongly stimulate the activity of a cellular ribonuclease, RNase F (ref. 7). Interferon also significantly increases the activity of a protein kinase which phosphorylates the initiation factor eIF-2 and can inhibit in vitro protein synthesis. Such interferon-induced enzymes, which affect RNA and protein metabolism, might be responsible for many of its effects on viruses. Indeed, inhibition of viral protein and RNA synthesis appears to have a major role in the antiviral state. We have now investigated possible interactions of the two enzymes with viral constituents during the course of infection and found that in two different membrane-coated RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV), there is an accumulation of the 2'-5') oligo-isoadenylate synthetase (E) in the virions. Most of the enzyme is bound to the virion ribonucleoprotein core. The incorporation of E into the virions suggests a direct involvement of the enzyme in regulation of virus functions.
The cytochrome CYP3A gene products, expressed in mammalian liver, are essential for the metabolism of lipophilic substrates, including endogenous steroid hormones and prescription drugs. CYP3A enzymes are extremely versatile and are inducible by many of their natural and xenobiotic substrates. Consequently, they form the molecular basis for many clinical drug-drug interactions. The induction of CYP3A enzymes is species-specific, and we have postulated that it involves one or more cellular factors, or receptor-like xeno-sensors. Here we identify one such factor unequivocally as the nuclear receptor pregnenolone X receptor (PXR) and its human homologue, steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR). We show that targeted disruption of the mouse PXR gene abolishes induction of CYP3A by prototypic inducers such as dexamethasone or pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile. In transgenic mice, an activated form of SXR causes constitutive upregulation of CYP3A gene expression and enhanced protection against toxic xenobiotic compounds. Furthermore, we show that the species origin of the receptor, rather than the promoter structure of CYP3A genes, dictates the species-specific pattern of CYP3A inducibility. Thus, we can generate 'humanized' transgenic mice that are responsive to human-specific inducers such as the antibiotic rifampicin. We conclude that SXR/PXR genes encode the primary species-specific xeno-sensors that mediate the adaptive hepatic response, and may represent the critical biochemical mechanism of human xenoprotection.
Recently the genes for several hormone receptors that interact with guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) have been cloned, including the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR), a human beta AR, the turkey erythrocyte beta AR and the porcine muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (MAR). All these receptors share some amino-acid homology with rhodopsin, particularly in 7 hydrophobic stretches of residues that are believed to represent transmembrane helices. To determine whether differences in ligand specificity result from the divergence in the sequences of the hydrophilic regions of these receptors, we have expressed in mammalian cells genes for the wild-type hamster and human beta AR proteins, and a series of deletion mutant genes of the hamster beta 2AR. The pharmacology of the expressed receptors indicates that most of the hydrophilic residues are not directly involved in the binding of agonists or antagonists to the receptor. In addition, we have identified a mutant receptor that has high agonist affinity but does not couple to adenylate cyclase.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) catalyze extracellular matrix degradation. Control of their activity is a promising target for therapy of diseases characterized by abnormal connective tissue turnover. MMPs are expressed as latent proenzymes that are activated by proteolytic cleavage that triggers a conformational change in the propeptide (cysteine switch). The structure of proMMP-2 reveals how the propeptide shields the catalytic cleft and that the cysteine switch may operate through cleavage of loops essential for propeptide stability.
Enzymes are exceptional catalysts that facilitate a wide variety of reactions under mild conditions, achieving high rate-enhancements with excellent chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivities. There is considerable interest in developing new enzymes for the synthesis of chemicals and pharmaceuticals and as tools for molecular biology. Methods have been developed for modifying and improving existing enzymes through screening, selection and directed evolution. However, the design and evolution of truly novel enzymes has relied on extensive knowledge of the mechanism of the reaction. Here we show that genuinely new enzymatic activities can be created de novo without the need for prior mechanistic information by selection from a naive protein library of very high diversity, with product formation as the sole selection criterion. We used messenger RNA display, in which proteins are covalently linked to their encoding mRNA, to select for functional proteins from an in vitro translated protein library of >10(12 )independent sequences without the constraints imposed by any in vivo step. This technique has been used to evolve new peptides and proteins that can bind a specific ligand, from both random-sequence libraries and libraries based on a known protein fold. We now describe the isolation of novel RNA ligases from a library that is based on a zinc finger scaffold, followed by in vitro directed evolution to further optimize these enzymes. The resulting ligases exhibit multiple turnover with rate enhancements of more than two-million-fold.
The genetic code is based on specific interactions between transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases and their cognate tRNAs. The anticodons for methionine and isoleucine tRNAs differ by a single nucleotide, and changing this nucleotide in an isoleucine tRNA is sufficient to change aminoacylation specificity to methionine. Results of combinatorial mutagenesis of an anticodon-binding-helix loop peptide were used to design a hybrid sequence composed of amino acid residues from methionyl- and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases. When the hybrid sequence was transplanted into isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, active enzyme was generated in vivo and in vitro. The transplanted peptide did not confer function to methionyl-tRNA synthetase, but the substitution of a single amino acid within the transplanted peptide conferred methionylation and prevented isoleucylation. Thus, the swap of a single amino acid in the transplanted peptide switches specificity between anticodons that differ by one nucleotide.
Poly(A) polymerase is essential for the maturation of messenger RNA, adding tracts of adenosine residues to the 3' end of precursor RNA generated by endonucleolytic cleavage. This mechanism of mRNA 3' processing seems to be similar in yeast and in higher eucaryotes, although there are differences in the recognition signals in the pre-mRNA. Here we describe the cloning of the gene for yeast poly(A) polymerase. The enzyme is encoded by a single and essential gene located near the centromere on the left arm of chromosome 11. Poly(A) polymerase purified from recombinant Escherichia coli has the same physical and biochemical properties as the yeast enzyme. The yeast poly(A) polymerase shares features of sequence with its mammalian homologue.
Forskolin is commonly used to stimulate adenylate cyclase in the study of modulation of ion channels and other proteins by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent second messenger systems. In addition to its action on adenylate cyclase, forskolin directly alters the gating of a single class of voltage-dependent potassium channels from a clonal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line. This alteration occurred in isolated cell-free patches independent of soluble cytoplasmic enzymes. The effect of forskolin was distinct from those of other agents that raise intracellular cAMP levels. The 1,9-dideoxy derivative of forskolin, which is unable to activate the cyclase, was also effective in altering the potassium channel activity. This direct action of forskolin can lead to misinterpretation of results in experiments in which forskolin is assumed to selectively activate adenylate cyclase.
Kinesin is a mechanoenzyme which uses energy liberated from ATP hydrolysis to transport particles towards the 'plus ends' of microtubules. The enzyme consists of two polypeptide heavy chains of relative molecular mass (Mr) approximately 110,000-140,000 (110K-140K) plus copurifying light chains; these polypeptides are arranged in a structure consisting of two globular heads attached to a fibrous stalk which terminates in a 'feathered' tail. Here we report that a function-disrupting monoclonal antikinesin, which binds to the 45K fragment of the kinesin heavy chain, recognizes an epitope located towards the N-terminal end of the heavy chain, and decorates the two globular heads lying at one end of the intact molecules (one antibody per head). The results show that the two heavy chains of native kinesin are arranged in parallel, and that the 45K fragments, which display nucleotide-sensitive interactions with microtubules, represent mechanochemical 'heads' located at the N-terminal regions of the heavy chains. Thus, it is likely that the kinesin heads are analogous to the subfragment-1 domains of myosin.
Acetylation within the globular core domain of histone H3 on lysine 56 (H3K56) has recently been shown to have a critical role in packaging DNA into chromatin following DNA replication and repair in budding yeast. However, the function or occurrence of this specific histone mark has not been studied in multicellular eukaryotes, mainly because the Rtt109 enzyme that is known to mediate acetylation of H3K56 (H3K56ac) is fungal-specific. Here we demonstrate that the histone acetyl transferase CBP (also known as Nejire) in flies and CBP and p300 (Ep300) in humans acetylate H3K56, whereas Drosophila Sir2 and human SIRT1 and SIRT2 deacetylate H3K56ac. The histone chaperones ASF1A in humans and Asf1 in Drosophila are required for acetylation of H3K56 in vivo, whereas the histone chaperone CAF-1 (chromatin assembly factor 1) in humans and Caf1 in Drosophila are required for the incorporation of histones bearing this mark into chromatin. We show that, in response to DNA damage, histones bearing acetylated K56 are assembled into chromatin in Drosophila and human cells, forming foci that colocalize with sites of DNA repair. Furthermore, acetylation of H3K56 is increased in multiple types of cancer, correlating with increased levels of ASF1A in these tumours. Our identification of multiple proteins regulating the levels of H3K56 acetylation in metazoans will allow future studies of this critical and unique histone modification that couples chromatin assembly to DNA synthesis, cell proliferation and cancer.
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a critical role in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin elicits the rapid release of LPL through mechanisms that are independent of energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Some of the metabolic actions of insulin may be mediated by the activation of a specific phospholipase that hydrolyzes a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecule. The insulin-sensitive glycosyl-PI is structurally similar to the glycolipid membrane anchor of a number of proteins. LPL appears to be anchored to the 3T3-L1 cell surface by glycosyl-PI, and its rapid release by insulin may be due to activation of a glycosyl-PI-specific phospholipase C.
Polyadenylate [poly(A)] polymerase (PAP) catalyzes the addition of a polyadenosine tail to almost all eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The crystal structure of the PAP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pap1) has been solved to 2.6 angstroms, both alone and in complex with 3'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3'-dATP). Like other nucleic acid polymerases, Pap1 is composed of three domains that encircle the active site. The arrangement of these domains, however, is quite different from that seen in polymerases that use a template to select and position their incoming nucleotides. The first two domains are functionally analogous to polymerase palm and fingers domains. The third domain is attached to the fingers domain and is known to interact with the single-stranded RNA primer. In the nucleotide complex, two molecules of 3'-dATP are bound to Pap1. One occupies the position of the incoming base, prior to its addition to the mRNA chain. The other is believed to occupy the position of the 3' end of the mRNA primer.
Although proteins fulfil most of the requirements that biology has for structural and functional components such as enzymes and receptors, RNA can also serve in these capacities. For example, RNA has sufficient structural plasticity to form ribozyme and receptor elements that exhibit considerable enzymatic power and binding specificity. Moreover, these activities can be combined to create allosteric ribozymes that are modulated by effector molecules. It has also been proposed that certain messenger RNAs might use allosteric mechanisms to mediate regulatory responses depending on specific metabolites. We report here that mRNAs encoding enzymes involved in thiamine (vitamin B(1)) biosynthesis in Escherichia coli can bind thiamine or its pyrophosphate derivative without the need for protein cofactors. The mRNA-effector complex adopts a distinct structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and leads to a reduction in gene expression. This metabolite-sensing regulatory system provides an example of a 'riboswitch' whose evolutionary origin might pre-date the emergence of proteins.
Recently, several genes coding for messenger RNA, transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA in eukaryotes have been found to be interrupted in their coding regions by DNA sequences which are not represented in the mature RNA transcripts (see ref. 1 for review). Many of these intervening sequences, or introns, are now known to be transcribed in the precursor RNA, from which they are subsequently processed out to form the mature RNA. As the intron-exon junctions must in some way be recognised for accurate splicing, the nucleotide sequences of these regions from a number of protein-coding and tRNA genes have been analysed. Sequence homologies were found at the splice points of the protein-coding gene introns from diverse organisms, but the tRNA intron boundaries were not similar to these. This has led to the speculation that different splicing activities are necessary for the processing of introns in mRNA and tRNA precursors. We report here the sequence of a ribosomal RNA gene intron from Tetrahymena in which intron-exon junctions differ from those analysed to date.
Gene inventory and metagenomic techniques have allowed rapid exploration of bacterial diversity and the potential physiologies present within microbial communities. However, it remains nontrivial to discover the identities of environmental bacteria carrying two or more genes of interest. We have used microfluidic digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify and analyze multiple, different genes obtained from single bacterial cells harvested from nature. A gene encoding a key enzyme involved in the mutualistic symbiosis occurring between termites and their gut microbiota was used as an experimental hook to discover the previously unknown ribosomal RNA-based species identity of several symbionts. The ability to systematically identify bacteria carrying a particular gene and to link any two or more genes of interest to single species residing in complex ecosystems opens up new opportunities for research on the environment.
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease and the leading genetic cause of infant mortality; it results from loss-of-function mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Humans have a paralogue, SMN2, whose exon 7 is predominantly skipped, but the limited amount of functional, full-length SMN protein expressed from SMN2 cannot fully compensate for a lack of SMN1. SMN is important for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, but downstream splicing targets involved in pathogenesis remain elusive. There is no effective SMA treatment, but SMN restoration in spinal cord motor neurons is thought to be necessary and sufficient. Non-central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, including cardiovascular defects, were recently reported in severe SMA mouse models and patients, reflecting autonomic dysfunction or direct effects in cardiac tissues. Here we compared systemic versus CNS restoration of SMN in a severe mouse model. We used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), ASO-10-27, that effectively corrects SMN2 splicing and restores SMN expression in motor neurons after intracerebroventricular injection. Systemic administration of ASO-10-27 to neonates robustly rescued severe SMA mice, much more effectively than intracerebroventricular administration; subcutaneous injections extended the median lifespan by 25 fold. Furthermore, neonatal SMA mice had decreased hepatic Igfals expression, leading to a pronounced reduction in circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and ASO-10-27 treatment restored IGF1 to normal levels. These results suggest that the liver is important in SMA pathogenesis, underscoring the importance of SMN in peripheral tissues, and demonstrate the efficacy of a promising drug candidate.
Gene expression is dependent on the interaction of DNA binding factors with distinct promoter control elements to activate RNA synthesis. The expression of the HIS4 gene in yeast is under two different control systems. One of these, general amino acid control, involves a DNA binding protein, GCN4, that stimulates transcription in response to amino acid starvation by binding to 5'-TGACTC-3' sequences in the HIS4 promoter region. A second system, the basal level control, stimulates HIS4 transcription in the absence of amino acid starvation. The basal level transcription of the HIS4 gene is under the control of two genes, BAS1 and BAS2, which are also required for the control of purine biosynthesis. In addition, BAS2 is required for the utilization of organic phosphates in the growth medium. Genetic mapping and DNA sequence analysis show that BAS2 is PHO2, a gene previously identified as a regulator of phosphate metabolism. Direct biochemical analysis shows that the BAS2 gene encodes a protein that binds to both the HIS4 and PHO5 promoters. The involvement of a single DNA binding protein in the regulation of histidine, adenine, and phosphate metabolism suggests that yeast may use a few key DNA binding proteins to coordinate the regulation of diverse metabolic pathways.
Two major developmentally regulated isoforms of the Drosophila chorion transcription factor CF2 differ by an extra zinc finger within the DNA binding domain. The preferred DNA binding sites were determined and are distinguished by an internal duplication of TAT in the site recognized by the isoform with the extra finger. The results are consistent with modular interactions between zinc fingers and trinucleotides and also suggest rules for recognition of AT-rich DNA sites by zinc finger proteins. The results show how modular finger interactions with trinucleotides can be used, in conjunction with alternative splicing, to alter the binding specificity and increase the spectrum of sites recognized by a DNA binding domain. Thus, CF2 may potentially regulate distinct sets of target genes during development.
Ribonucleic acids from the bacteriophage R17 and from R17 amber mutant AmB2 have been digested with ribonuclease T1. Of the products isolated, only one was different. It codes for the first six amino acid residues of the viral coat protein. The probable base sequence of the wild-type oligonucleotide is CpUpUpCpUpApApCpUpUpUpApCpUpCpApGp.
Olfactory transduction is thought to be initiated by the binding of odorants to specific receptor proteins in the cilia of olfactory receptor cells. The mechanism by which odorant binding could initiate membrane depolarization is unknown, but the recent discovery of an odorant-stimulated adenylate cyclase in purified olfactory cilia suggests that cyclic AMP may serve as an intracellular messenger for olfactory transduction. If so, then there might be a conductance in the ciliary plasma membrane which is controlled by cAMP. Here we report that excised patches of ciliary plasma membrane, obtained from dissociated receptor cells, contain a conductance which is gated directly by cAMP. This conductance resembles the cyclic GMP-gated conductance that mediates phototransduction in rod and cone outer segments, but differs in that it is activated by both cAMP and cGMP. Our data provide a mechanistic basis by which an odorant-stimulated increase in cyclic nucleotide concentration could lead to an increase in membrane conductance and therefore, to membrane depolarization. These data suggest a remarkable similarity between the mechanisms of olfactory and visual transduction and indicate considerable conservation of sensory transduction mechanisms.
Before quiescent cells can respond to mitogens and progress through the G1 phase of cell growth, new messenger RNA synthesis is required. The G1 phase seems to be a critical point of control in the cell cycle, where normal cells deprived of growth factors halt cycling while transformed cells do not, suggesting that regulatory genes, uncontrolled in the neoplastic phenotype, are expressed during the G0 to G1 transition. Some of these may code for nuclear proteins that participate in the transactivation of genes required for the progression through G1. The observed changes in expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc, following stimulation of fibroblasts with growth factors, support this notion as recent evidence suggests that c-FOS and c-MYC proteins can function as transactivating factors. Moreover, the rapid induction of several genes in fibroblasts coding for putative transacting factors during the G0 to G1 transition has been recently reported. Here we present the nucleotide sequence of a mouse cDNA clone coding for a 334 residue protein which shows 80% similarity with v-JUN and more than 98% similarity with the human c-JUN sequence. We have demonstrated that in quiescent fibroblasts c-jun transcription is rapidly induced during the G0 to G1 transition.
Complex enzymes containing Fe-S clusters are ubiquitous in nature, where they are involved in a number of fundamental processes including carbon dioxide fixation, nitrogen fixation and hydrogen metabolism. Hydrogen metabolism is facilitated by the activity of three evolutionarily and structurally unrelated enzymes: the [NiFe]-hydrogenases, [FeFe]-hydrogenases and [Fe]-hydrogenases (Hmd). The catalytic core of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydA), termed the H-cluster, exists as a [4Fe-4S] subcluster linked by a cysteine thiolate to a modified 2Fe subcluster with unique non-protein ligands. The 2Fe subcluster and non-protein ligands are synthesized by the hydrogenase maturation enzymes HydE, HydF and HydG; however, the mechanism, synthesis and means of insertion of H-cluster components remain unclear. Here we show the structure of HydA(DeltaEFG) (HydA expressed in a genetic background devoid of the active site H-cluster biosynthetic genes hydE, hydF and hydG) revealing the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster and an open pocket for the 2Fe subcluster. The structure indicates that H-cluster synthesis occurs in a stepwise manner, first with synthesis and insertion of the [4Fe-4S] subcluster by generalized host-cell machinery and then with synthesis and insertion of the 2Fe subcluster by specialized hydE-, hydF- and hydG-encoded maturation machinery. Insertion of the 2Fe subcluster presumably occurs through a cationically charged channel that collapses following incorporation, as a result of conformational changes in two conserved loop regions. The structure, together with phylogenetic analysis, indicates that HydA emerged within bacteria most likely from a Nar1-like ancestor lacking the 2Fe subcluster, and that this was followed by acquisition in several unicellular eukaryotes.
The toxicity of selenium to animals and plants has been known and extensively documented since the 1930's, but it is only during the past 15 years that selenium has also been shown to be an essential micronutrient for animals and bacteria. Very little is known about the specific role or roles of selenium and, to date, there are only three enzyme-catalyzed reactions that have been shown to require the participation of a selenium-containing protein. These are the reactions catalyzed by (i) formate dehydrogenase of bacteria, (ii) glycine reductase of clostridia, and (iii) glutathione peroxidase of erythrocytes. The common denominator of these selenium-dependent processes is that they are all oxidation-reduction reactions. A fourth selenoprotein has been isolated from skeletal muscle of sheep but its catalytic function has not been identified. The form in which selenium occurs in these selenoproteins is unknown. The selenoprotein of clostridial glycine reductase contains selenium in a covalently bound form. Studies in progress indicate that this may be an organoselenium compound not previously detected in nature. Identification of the chemical nature of selenium in proteins participating in electron transport processes should enable us to determine its specific role and to understand the basic defects in certain cardiac and skeletal muscle degenerative diseases which are selenium-deficiency syndromes. The greater availability and ease of isolation of the selenoprotein of the bacterial glycine reductase system makes this the biological material of choice for studies on the mechanism of action of selenium. An added attractive feature of this system is that it can conserve the energy made available by the reductive deamination of glycine in a biologically useful form by synthesizing ATP.
Signal transmission by insulin involves tyrosine phosphorylation of a major insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) and exchange of Ras-bound guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate. Proteins containing Src homology 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) domains, such as the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), bind tyrosine phosphate sites on IRS-1 through their SH2 regions. Such complexes in COS cells were found to contain the heterologously expressed putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor encoded by the Drosophila son of sevenless gene (dSos). Thus, GRB2, p85, or other proteins with SH2-SH3 adapter sequences may link Sos proteins to IRS-1 signaling complexes as part of the mechanism by which insulin activates Ras.
Chromatin reorganization is governed by multiple post-translational modifications of chromosomal proteins and DNA. These histone modifications are reversible, dynamic events that can regulate DNA-driven cellular processes. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate histone modification patterns remain largely unknown. In metazoans, reversible protein modification by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is catalysed by two enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). However, the significance of GlcNAcylation in chromatin reorganization remains elusive. Here we report that histone H2B is GlcNAcylated at residue S112 by OGT in vitro and in living cells. Histone GlcNAcylation fluctuated in response to extracellular glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). H2B S112 GlcNAcylation promotes K120 monoubiquitination, in which the GlcNAc moiety can serve as an anchor for a histone H2B ubiquitin ligase. H2B S112 GlcNAc was localized to euchromatic areas on fly polytene chromosomes. In a genome-wide analysis, H2B S112 GlcNAcylation sites were observed widely distributed over chromosomes including transcribed gene loci, with some sites co-localizing with H2B K120 monoubiquitination. These findings suggest that H2B S112 GlcNAcylation is a histone modification that facilitates H2BK120 monoubiquitination, presumably for transcriptional activation.
Ribonuclease (RNase) E is an extensively studied enzyme from Escherichia coli whose site-specific endoribonuclease activity on single-stranded RNA has a central role in the processing of ribosomal RNA, the degradation of messenger RNA and the control of replication of ColE1-type plasmids. Here we report a previously undetected activity of RNase E: the ability to shorten 3' poly(A)- and poly(U)-homopolymer tails on RNA molecules. This activity, which leaves a 6-nucleotide adenylate or a 1-nucleotide uridylate remnant on primary transcripts, resides in the amino-terminal region of RNase E and does not require other protein cofactors. Addition of a 3'-terminal phosphate group prevents both removal of the poly(A) tail and endonucleolytic cleavage within primary transcripts, but has no effect on the cleavage of transcripts with tails that have already been truncated. The ability of RNase E to shorten poly(A) tails, together with the effect of tail length on endonucleolytic cleavage within primary transcripts, suggests a mechanism by which RNase E may exercise overall control over RNA decay.
The phosphorylation of heptahelical receptors by heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) is a universal regulatory mechanism that leads to desensitization of G protein signaling and to the activation of alternative signaling pathways. We determined the crystallographic structure of bovine GRK2 in complex with G protein beta1gamma2 subunits. Our results show how the three domains of GRK2-the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) homology, protein kinase, and pleckstrin homology domains-integrate their respective activities and recruit the enzyme to the cell membrane in an orientation that not only facilitates receptor phosphorylation, but also allows for the simultaneous inhibition of signaling by Galpha and Gbetagamma subunits.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations that reduce the activity of an insulin-like receptor (daf-2) or a phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (age-1) favour entry into the dauer state during larval development and extend lifespan in adults. Downregulation of this pathway activates a forkhead transcription factor (daf-16), which may regulate targets that promote dauer formation in larvae and stress resistance and longevity in adults. In yeast, the SIR2 gene determines the lifespan of mother cells, and adding an extra copy of SIR2 extends lifespan. Sir2 mediates chromatin silencing through a histone deacetylase activity that depends on NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) as a cofactor. We have surveyed the lifespan of C. elegans strains containing duplications of chromosomal regions. Here we report that a duplication containing sir-2.1-the C. elegans gene most homologous to yeast SIR2-confers a lifespan that is extended by up to 50%. Genetic analysis indicates that the sir-2.1 transgene functions upstream of daf-16 in the insulin-like signalling pathway. Our findings suggest that Sir2 proteins may couple longevity to nutrient availability in many eukaryotic organisms.
During transcription, RNA polymerase (Pol) II synthesizes eukaryotic messenger RNA. Transcription is coupled to RNA processing by the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II, which consists of up to 52 repeats of the sequence Tyr 1-Ser 2-Pro 3-Thr 4-Ser 5-Pro 6-Ser 7 (refs 1, 2). After phosphorylation, the CTD binds tightly to a conserved CTD-interacting domain (CID) present in the proteins Pcf11 and Nrd1, which are essential and evolutionarily conserved factors for polyadenylation-dependent and -independent 3'-RNA processing, respectively. Here we describe the structure of a Ser 2-phosphorylated CTD peptide bound to the CID domain of Pcf11. The CTD motif Ser 2-Pro 3-Thr 4-Ser 5 forms a beta-turn that binds to a conserved groove in the CID domain. The Ser 2 phosphate group does not make direct contact with the CID domain, but may be recognized indirectly because it stabilizes the beta-turn with an additional hydrogen bond. Iteration of the peptide structure results in a compact beta-spiral model of the CTD. The model suggests that, during the mRNA transcription-processing cycle, compact spiral regions in the CTD are unravelled and regenerated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.
The determination of the total 5,224 base-pair DNA sequence of the virus SV40 has enabled us to locate precisely the known genes on the genome. At least 15.2% of the genome is presumably not translated into polypeptides. Particular points of interest revealed by the complete sequence are the initiation of the early t and T antigens at the same position and the fact that the T antigen is coded by two non-contiguous regions of the genome; the T antigen mRNA is spliced in the coding region. In the late region the gene for the major protein VP1 overlaps those for proteins VP2 and VP3 over 122 nucleotides but is read in a different frame. The almost complete amino acid sequences of the two early proteins as well as those of the late proteins have been deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The mRNAs for the latter three proteins are presumably spliced out of a common primary RNA transcript. The use of degenerate codons is decidedly non-random, but is similar for the early and late regions. Codons of the type NUC, NCG and CGN are absent or very rare.
Iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) binds iron-responsive elements (IREs) in messenger RNAs (mRNAs), to repress translation or degradation, or binds an iron-sulfur cluster, to become a cytosolic aconitase enzyme. The 2.8 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the IRP1:ferritin H IRE complex shows an open protein conformation compared with that of cytosolic aconitase. The extended, L-shaped IRP1 molecule embraces the IRE stem-loop through interactions at two sites separated by approximately 30 angstroms, each involving about a dozen protein:RNA bonds. Extensive conformational changes related to binding the IRE or an iron-sulfur cluster explain the alternate functions of IRP1 as an mRNA regulator or enzyme.
The architecture of higher plants is established through the activity of lateral meristems--small groups of stem cells formed during vegetative and reproductive development. Lateral meristems generate branches and inflorescence structures, which define the overall form of a plant, and are largely responsible for the evolution of different plant architectures. Here, we report the isolation of the barren stalk1 gene, which encodes a non-canonical basic helix-loop-helix protein required for the initiation of all aerial lateral meristems in maize. barren stalk1 represents one of the earliest genes involved in the patterning of maize inflorescences, and, together with the teosinte branched1 gene, it regulates vegetative lateral meristem development. The architecture of maize has been a major target of selection for early agriculturalists and modern farmers, because it influences harvesting, breeding strategies and mechanization. By sampling nucleotide diversity in the barren stalk1 region, we show that two haplotypes entered the maize gene pool from its wild progenitor, teosinte, and that only one was incorporated throughout modern inbreds, suggesting that barren stalk1 was selected for agronomic purposes.
Group I introns possess a single active site that catalyzes the two sequential reactions of self-splicing. An RNA comprising the two domains of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron catalytic core retains activity, and the 5.0 angstrom crystal structure of this 247-nucleotide ribozyme is now described. Close packing of the two domains forms a shallow cleft capable of binding the short helix that contains the 5' splice site. The helix that provides the binding site for the guanosine substrate deviates significantly from A-form geometry, providing a tight binding pocket. The binding pockets for both the 5' splice site helix and guanosine are formed and oriented in the absence of these substrates. Thus, this large ribozyme is largely preorganized for catalysis, much like a globular protein enzyme.
Protein lysine acetylation has emerged as a key posttranslational modification in cellular regulation, in particular through the modification of histones and nuclear transcription regulators. We show that lysine acetylation is a prevalent modification in enzymes that catalyze intermediate metabolism. Virtually every enzyme in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the urea cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and glycogen metabolism was found to be acetylated in human liver tissue. The concentration of metabolic fuels, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, influenced the acetylation status of metabolic enzymes. Acetylation activated enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase in fatty acid oxidation and malate dehydrogenase in the TCA cycle, inhibited argininosuccinate lyase in the urea cycle, and destabilized phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in gluconeogenesis. Our study reveals that acetylation plays a major role in metabolic regulation.
The human ribosomal RNA promoter contains two distinct control elements (UCE and core) both of which are recognized by the sequence-specific DNA binding protein UBF1, which has now been purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified factor activates RNA polymerase I (RNA pol I) transcription through direct interactions with either control element. A second RNA pol I transcription factor, designated SL1, participates in the promoter recognition process and is required to reconstitute transcription in vitro. Although SL1 alone has no sequence-specific DNA binding activity, deoxyribonuclease I footprinting experiments reveal that a cooperative interaction between UBF1 and SL1 leads to the formation of a new protein-DNA complex at the UCE and core elements. In vitro transcription experiments indicate that formation of the UBF1-SL1 complex is vital for transcriptional activation by UBF1. Thus, protein-protein interactions between UBF1 and SL1 are required for targeting of SL1 to cis-control sequences of the promoter.
A 50-nucleotide untranslated region is shown to be present within the coding sequence of Escherichia coli bacteriophage T4 gene 60, which encodes one of the subunits for its type II DNA topoisomerase. This interruption is part of the transcribed messenger RNA and appears not to be removed before translation. Thus, the usual colinearity between messenger RNA and the encoded protein sequence apparently does not exist in this case. The interruption is bracketed by a direct repeat of five base pairs. A mechanism is proposed in which folding of the untranslated region brings together codons separated by the interruption so that the elongating ribosome may skip the 50 nucleotides during translation. The alternative possibility, that the protein is efficiently translated from a very minor and undetectable form of processed messenger RNA, seems unlikely, but has not been completely ruled out.
Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are enzymes that detoxify heterocyclic compounds (xenobiotics) by covalently linking glutathione to the substrate, forming a glutathione S-conjugate. A glutathione pump in the vacuolar membrane of barley actively sequesters herbicide-glutathione S-conjugates; glutathionation allows recognition and entry of the conjugates into vacuoles. The protein encoded by the Bronze-2 gene in maize performs the last genetically defined step in anthocyanin biosynthesis, resulting in the deposition of red and purple pigments in the vacuoles of maize tissues. We show here that Bz2 encodes a GST with activity in maize, transformed Arabidopsis thaliana plants and Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that anthocyanins extracted from maize protoplasts expressing BZ2 are conjugated with glutathione, and that vanadate, a known inhibitor of the glutathione pump in plant vacuolar membranes, inhibits the accumulation of anthocyanins in the vacuole. These results provide a biochemical function for BZ2, and suggest a common mechanism for the ability of plants to sequester structurally similar but functionally diverse molecules in the vacuole.
Kinesin motors are specialized enzymes that use hydrolysis of ATP to generate force and movement along their cellular tracks, the microtubules. Although numerous biochemical and biophysical studies have accumulated much data that link microtubule-assisted ATP hydrolysis to kinesin motion, the structural view of kinesin movement remains unclear. This study of the monomeric kinesin motor KIF1A combines X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, and allows analysis of force-generating conformational changes at atomic resolution. The motor is revealed in its two functionally critical states-complexed with ADP and with a non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP. The conformational change observed between the ADP-bound and the ATP-like structures of the KIF1A catalytic core is modular, extends to all kinesins and is similar to the conformational change used by myosin motors and G proteins. Docking of the ADP-bound and ATP-like crystallographic models of KIF1A into the corresponding cryo-electron microscopy maps suggests a rationale for the plus-end directional bias associated with the kinesin catalytic core.
The plasma protease inhibitors control a wide variety of physiological functions including blood coagulation, complement activation and aspects of the inflammatory response. The inhibitors function by forming a 1:1 complex with a specific protease within the reactive centre region of the inhibitor. Little is known about the evolutionary relationships of these inhibitors. We report here the sequences of cDNAs which represent the C-terminal halves of the two major murine plasma protease inhibitors. One of these, murine alpha 1-antitrypsin, more appropriately called alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI), has diverged from its human counterpart at a vital position in the reactive centre but this has not led to a physiologically significant change in function. Also, we have determined the partial sequence of a recently characterized protein termed contrapsin, which inhibits trypsin-like proteases. We show, surprisingly, that contrapsin is highly homologous to human alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteases. The reactive centre regions of these two inhibitors have diverged considerably, which may account for the differences in specificity. We propose that the genes for contrapsin and human alpha 1-antichymotrypsin are the descendents of a single gene that have evolved since rodent and primate divergence to encode proteins with different functions.
The pathway involving the signalling protein p21Ras propagates a range of extracellular signals from receptors on the cell membrane to the cytoplasm and nucleus. The Ras proteins regulate many effectors, including members of the Raf family of protein kinases. Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1 at the plasma membrane involves phosphorylation events, protein-protein interactions and structural changes. Phosphorylation of serine residues 338 or 339 in the catalytic domain of Raf-1 regulates its activation in response to Ras, Src and epidermal growth factor. Here we show that the p21-activated protein kinase Pak3 phosphorylates Raf-1 on serine 338 in vitro and in vivo. The p21-activated protein kinases are regulated by the Rho-family GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Our results indicate that signal transduction through Raf-1 depends on both Ras and the activation of the Pak pathway. As guanine-nucleotide-exchange activity on Rac can be stimulated by a Ras-dependent phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, a mechanism could exist through which one Ras effector pathway can be influenced by another.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis claims more human lives each year than any other bacterial pathogen. Infection is maintained in spite of acquired immunity and resists eradication by antimicrobials. Despite an urgent need for new therapies targeting persistent bacteria, our knowledge of bacterial metabolism throughout the course of infection remains rudimentary. Here we report that persistence of M. tuberculosis in mice is facilitated by isocitrate lyase (ICL), an enzyme essential for the metabolism of fatty acids. Disruption of the icl gene attenuated bacterial persistence and virulence in immune-competent mice without affecting bacterial growth during the acute phase of infection. A link between the requirement for ICL and the immune status of the host was established by the restored virulence of delta icl bacteria in interferon-gamma knockout mice. This link was apparent at the level of the infected macrophage: Activation of infected macrophages increased expression of ICL, and the delta icl mutant was markedly attenuated for survival in activated but not resting macrophages. These data suggest that the metabolism of M. tuberculosis in vivo is profoundly influenced by the host response to infection, an observation with important implications for the treatment of chronic tuberculosis.
Potassium is the most abundant cation in higher plants and is crucial for plant nutrition, growth, tropisms, enzyme homeostasis and osmoregulation. K+ accumulation can be rate-limiting for agricultural production. K+ uptake from soils into roots is largely mediated by high-affinity K+ uptake (Km approximately 10-40 microM) (refs 1, 2, 5-7). But although K+ channels allow low-affinity K+ uptake, both the transport mechanism and structure of the high-affinity K+ nutrition pathway remain unknown. Here we use expression cloning to isolate a complementary DNA encoding a membrane protein (HKT1) from wheat roots which confers the ability to take up K+. The substrate affinity, saturation and cation selectivity of HKT1 correspond to hallmark properties of classical high-affinity K+ uptake in plants. The transport mechanism of HKT1 uses K(+)-H+ co-uptake. Expression of HKT1 is localized to specific root and leaf regions which represent primary sites for K+ uptake in plants. HKT1 is important for plant nutrition and could possibly contribute to environmental alkali metal toxicities.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small-cell lung carcinomas in smokers being the predominant form of the disease. Although previous studies have identified important common somatic mutations in lung cancers, they have primarily focused on a limited set of genes and have thus provided a constrained view of the mutational spectrum. Recent cancer sequencing efforts have used next-generation sequencing technologies to provide a genome-wide view of mutations in leukaemia, breast cancer and cancer cell lines. Here we present the complete sequences of a primary lung tumour (60x coverage) and adjacent normal tissue (46x). Comparing the two genomes, we identify a wide variety of somatic variations, including >50,000 high-confidence single nucleotide variants. We validated 530 somatic single nucleotide variants in this tumour, including one in the KRAS proto-oncogene and 391 others in coding regions, as well as 43 large-scale structural variations. These constitute a large set of new somatic mutations and yield an estimated 17.7 per megabase genome-wide somatic mutation rate. Notably, we observe a distinct pattern of selection against mutations within expressed genes compared to non-expressed genes and in promoter regions up to 5 kilobases upstream of all protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we observe a higher rate of amino acid-changing mutations in kinase genes. We present a comprehensive view of somatic alterations in a single lung tumour, and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of distinct selective pressures present within the tumour environment.
Contact-mediated axon repulsion by ephrins raises an unresolved question: these cell surface ligands form a high-affinity multivalent complex with their receptors present on axons, yet rather than being bound, axons can be rapidly repelled. We show here that ephrin-A2 forms a stable complex with the metalloprotease Kuzbanian, involving interactions outside the cleavage region and the protease domain. Eph receptor binding triggered ephrin-A2 cleavage in a localized reaction specific to the cognate ligand. A cleavage-inhibiting mutation in ephrin-A2 delayed axon withdrawal. These studies reveal mechanisms for protease recognition and control of cell surface proteins, and, for ephrin-A2, they may provide a means for efficient axon detachment and termination of signaling.
The nucleotide sequence of the lac promoter-operator region has been determined. The 122 base pairs comprising this region include the recognition sites for RNA polymerase, the positive regulatory protein, CAP, and the negative regulatory protein, the repressor. Identification of mutant variants of the sequence combined with the in vitro biochemical studies of others has allowed us to tentatively identify the recognition site for each of these proteins, and to suggest how CAP might act at a distance to affect the interaction of RNA polymerase with the promoter.
A study was conducted to determine the fidelity of DNA synthesis catalyzed in vitro by the reverse transcriptase from a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Like other retroviral reverse transcriptases, the HIV-1 enzyme does not correct errors by exonucleolytic proofreading. Measurements with M13mp2-based fidelity assays indicated that the HIV-1 enzyme, isolated either from virus particles or from Escherichia coli cells infected with a plasmid expressing the cloned gene, was exceptionally inaccurate, having an average error rate per detectable nucleotide incorporated of 1/1700. It was, in fact, the least accurate reverse transcriptase described to date, one-tenth as accurate as the polymerases isolated from avian myeloblastosis or murine leukemia viruses, which have average error rates of approximately 1/17,000 and approximately 1/30,000, respectively. DNA sequence analyses of mutations generated by HIV-1 polymerase showed that base substitution, addition, and deletion errors were all produced. Certain template positions were mutational hotspots where the error rate could be as high as 1 per 70 polymerized nucleotides. The data are consistent with the notion that the exceptional diversity of the HIV-1 genome results from error-prone reverse transcription.
Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) is used as a cofactor in many key metabolic enzymes. We present evidence that the ThDPs in the two active sites of the E1 (EC 1.2.4.1) component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex communicate over a distance of 20 angstroms by reversibly shuttling a proton through an acidic tunnel in the protein. This "proton wire" permits the co-factors to serve reciprocally as general acid/base in catalysis and to switch the conformation of crucial active-site peptide loops. This synchronizes the progression of chemical events and can account for the oligomeric organization, conformational asymmetry, and "ping-pong" kinetic properties of E1 and other thiamine-dependent enzymes.
The ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase (RTPR) from Lactobacillus leichmannii catalyzes adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)-dependent nucleotide reduction, as well as exchange of the 5' hydrogens of AdoCbl with solvent. A protein-based thiyl radical is proposed as an intermediate in both of these processes. In the presence of RTPR containing specifically deuterated cysteine residues, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of an intermediate in the exchange reaction and the reduction reaction, trapped by rapid freeze quench techniques, exhibits narrowed hyperfine features relative to the corresponding unlabeled RTPR. The spectrum was interpreted to represent a thiyl radical coupled to cob(II)alamin. Another proposed intermediate, 5'-deoxyadenosine, was detected by rapid acid quench techniques. Similarities in mechanism between RTPR and the Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase suggest that both enzymes require a thiyl radical for catalysis.
In most RNA viruses, genome replication and transcription are catalysed by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Double-stranded RNA viruses perform these operations in a capsid (the polymerase complex), using an enzyme that can read both single- and double-stranded RNA. Structures have been solved for such viral capsids, but they do not resolve the polymerase subunits in any detail. Here we show that the 2 A resolution X-ray structure of the active polymerase subunit from the double-stranded RNA bacteriophage straight phi6 is highly similar to that of the polymerase of hepatitis C virus, providing an evolutionary link between double-stranded RNA viruses and flaviviruses. By crystal soaking and co-crystallization, we determined a number of other structures, including complexes with oligonucleotide and/or nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), that suggest a mechanism by which the incoming double-stranded RNA is opened up to feed the template through to the active site, while the substrates enter by another route. The template strand initially overshoots, locking into a specificity pocket, and then, in the presence of cognate NTPs, reverses to form the initiation complex; this process engages two NTPs, one of which acts with the carboxy-terminal domain of the protein to prime the reaction. Our results provide a working model for the initiation of replication and transcription.
Ribonucleotide reductases catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. Three classes have been identified, all using free-radical chemistry but based on different cofactors. Classes I and II have been shown to be evolutionarily related, whereas the origin of anaerobic class III has remained elusive. The structure of a class III enzyme suggests a common origin for the three classes but shows differences in the active site that can be understood on the basis of the radical-initiation system and source of reductive electrons, as well as a unique protein glycyl radical site. A possible evolutionary relationship between early deoxyribonucleotide metabolism and primary anaerobic metabolism is suggested.
Cholesterol, fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and other lipids present in our diets are not only nutritionally important but serve as precursors for ligands that bind to receptors in the nucleus. To become biologically active, these lipids must first be absorbed by the intestine and transformed by metabolic enzymes before they are delivered to their sites of action in the body. Ultimately, the lipids must be eliminated to maintain a normal physiological state. The need to coordinate this entire lipid-based metabolic signaling cascade raises important questions regarding the mechanisms that govern these pathways. Specifically, what is the nature of communication between these bioactive lipids and their receptors, binding proteins, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes that links them physiologically and speaks to a higher level of metabolic control? Some general principles that govern the actions of this class of bioactive lipids and their nuclear receptors are considered here, and the scheme that emerges reveals a complex molecular script at work.
Polyglutamylation of tubulin has been implicated in several functions of microtubules, but the identification of the responsible enzyme(s) has been challenging. We found that the neuronal tubulin polyglutamylase is a protein complex containing a tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) protein, TTLL1. TTLL1 is a member of a large family of proteins with a TTL homology domain, whose members could catalyze ligations of diverse amino acids to tubulins or other substrates. In the model protist Tetrahymena thermophila, two conserved types of polyglutamylases were characterized that differ in substrate preference and subcellular localization.
During neurogenesis in Drosophila both neurons and nonneuronal cells are produced from a population of initially equivalent cells. The kuzbanian (kuz) gene described here is essential for the partitioning of neural and nonneuronal cells during development of both the central and peripheral nervous systems in Drosophila. Mosaic analyses indicated that kuz is required for cells to receive signals inhibiting the neural fate. These analyses further revealed that the development of a neuron requires a kuz-mediated positive signal from neighboring cells. The kuz gene encodes a metalloprotease-disintegrin protein with a highly conserved bovine homolog, raising the possibility that kuz homologs may act in similar processes during mammalian neurogenesis.
Oxidized guanine (8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine; 8-oxo-G) is a potent mutagen because of its ambiguous pairing with cytosine and adenine. The Escherichia coli MutT protein specifically hydrolyzes both 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP) and 8-oxo-guanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-rGTP), which are otherwise incorporated in DNA and RNA opposite template A. In vivo, this cleaning of the nucleotide pools decreases both DNA replication and transcription errors. The effect of mutT mutation on transcription fidelity was shown to depend on oxidative metabolism. Such control of transcriptional fidelity by the ubiquitous MutT function has implications for evolution of RNA-based life, phenotypic expression, adaptive mutagenesis, and functional maintenance of nondividing cells.
The guanine nucleotide exchange factor p63RhoGEF is an effector of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) Galphaq and thereby links Galphaq-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the activation of the small-molecular-weight G protein RhoA. We determined the crystal structure of the Galphaq-p63RhoGEF-RhoA complex, detailing the interactions of Galphaq with the Dbl and pleckstrin homology (DH and PH) domains of p63RhoGEF. These interactions involve the effector-binding site and the C-terminal region of Galphaq and appear to relieve autoinhibition of the catalytic DH domain by the PH domain. Trio, Duet, and p63RhoGEF are shown to constitute a family of Galphaq effectors that appear to activate RhoA both in vitro and in intact cells. We propose that this structure represents the crux of an ancient signal transduction pathway that is expected to be important in an array of physiological processes.
The Golgi apparatus is partitioned during mitosis in animal cells by a process of fragmentation, dispersal, and reassembly in each daughter cell. We fractionated the Golgi apparatus in vivo using the drug brefeldin A or a dominant-negative mutant of the Sar1p protein. After these treatments, Golgi enzymes moved back to the endoplasmic reticulum, leaving behind a matrix of Golgi structural proteins. Under these conditions, cells still entered and exited mitosis normally, and their Golgi matrix partitioned in a manner very similar to that of the complete organelle. Thus, the matrix may be the partitioning unit of the Golgi apparatus and may carry the Golgi enzyme-containing membranes into the daughter cells.
The observations that atherosclerosis often occurs in non-smokers without elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and that most atherosclerosis loci so far identified in mice do not affect systemic risk factors associated with atherosclerosis, suggest that as-yet-unidentified mechanisms must contribute to vascular disease. Arterial walls undergo regional disturbances of metabolism that include the uncoupling of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, a process that occurs to some extent in all cells and may be characteristic of blood vessels being predisposed to the development of atherosclerosis. To test the hypothesis that inefficient metabolism in blood vessels promotes vascular disease, we generated mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in the artery wall. Here we show that UCP1 expression in aortic smooth muscle cells causes hypertension and increases dietary atherosclerosis without affecting cholesterol levels. UCP1 expression also increases superoxide production and decreases the availability of nitric oxide, evidence of oxidative stress. These results provide proof of principle that inefficient metabolism in blood vessels can cause vascular disease.
The antennae of male silk moths are extremely sensitive to the female sex pheromone such that a male moth can find a female up to 4.5 km away. This remarkable sensitivity is due to both the morphological and biochemical design of these antennae. Along the branches of the plumose antennae are the sensilla trichodea, each consisting of a hollow cuticular hair containing two unbranched dendrites bathed in a fluid, the receptor lymph ,3. The dendrites and receptor lymph are isolated from the haemolymph by a barrier of epidermal cells which secreted the cuticular hair. Pheromone molecules are thought to diffuse down 100 A-wide pore tubules through the cuticular wall and across the receptor lymph space to receptors located in the dendritic membrane. To prevent the accumulation of residual stimulant and hence sensory adaptation, the pheromone molecules are subsequently inactivated in an apparent two-step process of rapid 'early inactivation' followed by much slower enzymatic degradation. The biochemistry involved in this sequence of events is largely unknown. We report here the identification of three proteins which interact with the pheromone of the wild silk moth Antheraea polyphemus: a pheromone-binding protein and a pheromone-degrading esterase, both uniquely located in the pheromone-sensitive sensilla; and a second esterase common to all cuticular tissues except the sensilla.
Binding of interferons IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma to their cell surface receptors promptly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of latent cytoplasmic transcriptional activators (or Stat proteins, for signal transducers and activators of transcription). Interferon-alpha activates both Stat91 (M(r) 91,000; ref. 1) and Stat113 (M(r) 113,000; ref. 2) whereas IFN-gamma activates only Stat91 (refs 3, 4). The activated proteins then move into the nucleus and directly activate genes induced by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma. Somatic cell genetics experiments have demonstrated a requirement for tyrosine kinase-2 (Tyk2) in the IFN-alpha response pathway and for Jak2 (ref. 6), a kinase with similar sequence, in the IFN-gamma response pathway. Here we investigate the tyrosine phosphorylation events on Stat and Jak proteins after treatment of cells with IFNs alpha and gamma and with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Stat91 is phosphorylated on Tyr701 after cells are treated with IFN-alpha and EGF, as it was after treatment with IFN-gamma (ref. 8). We find that Jak1 also becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine after cells are treated with these same three ligands, although each ligand is shown to activate at least one other different kinase. Jak1 may therefore be the enzyme that phosphorylates Tyr 701 in Stat91.
The variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) is the predominant component of the surface coat of the African trypanosome. The expression of antigenically distinct VSGs on minor populations during infection allows the parasite to escape the host immune response. Purification of the protein is facilitated by the enzymatic release of a soluble form of VSG (sVSG) which occurs on cell lysis. The soluble form is a dimer with an approximate molecular weight of 120,000-130,000. Partial proteolysis of sVSG reveals a protease-sensitive link between an amino-terminal domain which comprises about two-thirds of the molecule, and a C-terminal domain which contains the membrane attachment site. We have obtained crystals suitable for high-resolution structural analysis from preparations of three sVSG: MITat 1.2, ILTat 1.25 and ILTat 1.22. The crystal structure of the dimer of the MITat 1.2 amino-terminal domain has been solved to 6 A resolution. We report here that the dimer is an unusual 90 A rod-like molecule composed of a helical bundle of at least four 80 A-long alpha-helices.
Deep vein thrombosis in man presents a considerable clinical challenge. Despite the availability of prophylactic measures, therapeutic thrombolysis is often necessary, but is difficult and hazardous. Treatments have included the administration of plasmin, other less specific proteolytic enzymes, the indirect plasminogen activator, streptokinase, and the direct activators, urokinase and streptokinase-human plasmin complex. All these treatments have been associated with some haemostatic breakdown, which has discouraged their widespread application. The enzyme components of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways can, in general, be classed as serine proteases, with a catalytic mechanism which operates via acyl-enzyme intermediates. Chase and Shaw showed that p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidinobenzoate could specifically acylate the active centre of trypsin-like enzymes, giving rise to a stable p-guanidinobenzoyl enzyme and other stable acyl-enzymes have since been described. We report here the fibrinolytic use of acylated derivatives of plasmin (E.C.3.4.21.7) and streptokinase-plasmin(ogen) complexes.
The pituitary hormones corticotropin (ACTH) and beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) are formed from a large common precursor. Recently, we have elucidated the whole primary structure of the bovine ACTH-beta-LPH precursor (designated alternatively as preproopiocortin) by determining the nucleotide sequence of cloned DNA complementary to the mRNA coding for the precursor protein. The amino acid sequence assigned has disclosed a characteristic repetitive structure of the ACTH-beta-LPH precursor. The repetitive units of the precursor protein each contain a melanotropin (MSH) sequence (alpha-, beta- or gamma-MSH) as well as other peptide components such as beta-endorphin and corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide (CLIP). The repetitive units as well as their peptide components are each bounded by paired basic amino acid residues, which apparently represent the sites of proteolytic processing. Several studies have confirmed the translational initiation site and protein structure assigned (see also ref. 11 and refs therein). In view of the recent knowledge about the organization of eukaryotic genes (see refs 12, 13 for reviews), it would be of particular interest to investigate the relationship between the repetitive structure of the ACTH-beta-LPH precursor containing different functional components and the arrangement of the protein-coding sequence in its gene. We have now isolated and characterized bovine genomic DNA fragments encoding this precursor protein and have demonstrated that the protein sequence is encoded by two non-consecutive DNA segments. An intron (intervening sequence) of approximately 2.2 kilobase pairs separates the smaller exon (mRNA-coding sequence), which contains the gene sequence encoding the signal peptide, from the larger exon, which contains the gene sequence for most of the protein structure, including the known biologically active component peptides.
Rates of protein folding reactions vary considerably. Some denatured proteins regain the native conformation within milliseconds or seconds, whereas others refold very slowly in the time range of minutes or hours. Varying folding rates are observed not only for different proteins, but can also be detected for single polypeptide species. This originates from the co-existence of fast- and slow-folding forms of the unfolded protein, which regain the native state with different rates. The proline hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for this heterogeneity. It assumes that the slow-folding molecules possess non-native isomers of peptide bonds between proline and another residue, and that crucial steps in the refolding of the slow-folding molecules are limited in rate by the slow reisomerization of such incorrect proline peptide bonds. Recently the enzyme peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) was discovered and purified from pig kidney. It catalyses efficiently the cis in equilibrium trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides. Here we show that it also catalyses slow steps in the refolding of a number of proteins of which fast- and slow-folding species have been observed and where it was suggested that proline isomerization was involved in slow refolding. The efficiency of catalysis depends on the accessibility for the isomerase of the particular proline peptide bonds in the refolding protein chain.
The PPP2R1B gene, which encodes the beta isoform of the A subunit of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), was identified as a putative human tumor suppressor gene. Sequencing of the PPP2R1B gene, located on human chromosome 11q22-24, revealed somatic alterations in 15% (5 out of 33) of primary lung tumors, 6% (4 out of 70) of lung tumor-derived cell lines, and 15% (2 out of 13) of primary colon tumors. One deletion mutation generated a truncated PP2A-Abeta protein that was unable to bind to the catalytic subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. The PP2R1B gene product may suppress tumor development through its role in cell cycle regulation and cellular growth control.
Movement of the ligand/receptor complex in rhodopsin (Rh) has been traced. Bleaching of diazoketo rhodopsin (DK-Rh) containing 11-cis-3-diazo-4-oxo-retinal yields batho-, lumi-, meta-I-, and meta-II-Rh intermediates corresponding to those of native Rh but at lower temperatures. Photoaffinity labeling of DK-Rh and these bleaching intermediates shows that the ionone ring cross-links to tryptophan-265 on helix F in DK-Rh and batho-Rh, and to alanine-169 on helix D in lumi-, meta-I-, and meta-II-Rh intermediates. It is likely that these movements involving a flip-over of the chromophoric ring trigger changes in cytoplasmic membrane loops resulting in heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) activation.
The template activity of DNA with calf thymus DNA polymerase has been studied in sections of fixed brain, liver, and heart tissues from young and senescent mice. The enzyme catalyzed greater incorporation of deoxyribonucleotide monophosphates into nuclei of old mouse neurons, astrocytes, Kupffer cells, and heart muscle fibers. The results are interpreted as the accumulation of DNA strand breaks with aging.
The CDC13 gene has previously been implicated in the maintenance of telomere integrity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With the use of two classes of mutations, here it is shown that CDC13 has two discrete roles at the telomere. The cdc13-2est mutation perturbs a function required in vivo for telomerase regulation but not in vitro for enzyme activity, whereas cdc13-1ts defines a separate essential role at the telomere. In vitro, purified Cdc13p binds to single-strand yeast telomeric DNA. Therefore, Cdc13p is a telomere-binding protein required to protect the telomere and mediate access of telomerase to the chromosomal terminus.
Chromatin is composed of DNA and a variety of modified histones and non-histone proteins, which have an impact on cell differentiation, gene regulation and other key cellular processes. Here we present a genome-wide chromatin landscape for Drosophila melanogaster based on eighteen histone modifications, summarized by nine prevalent combinatorial patterns. Integrative analysis with other data (non-histone chromatin proteins, DNase I hypersensitivity, GRO-Seq reads produced by engaged polymerase, short/long RNA products) reveals discrete characteristics of chromosomes, genes, regulatory elements and other functional domains. We find that active genes display distinct chromatin signatures that are correlated with disparate gene lengths, exon patterns, regulatory functions and genomic contexts. We also demonstrate a diversity of signatures among Polycomb targets that include a subset with paused polymerase. This systematic profiling and integrative analysis of chromatin signatures provides insights into how genomic elements are regulated, and will serve as a resource for future experimental investigations of genome structure and function.
Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are directly activated by the binding of several ligands. For these channels as well as for other allosteric proteins, the functional effects of each ligand-binding event have been difficult to assess because ligands continuously bind and unbind at each site. Furthermore, in retinal rod photoreceptors the low cytoplasmic concentration of cyclic GMP means that channels exist primarily in partially liganded states, so it is important to determine how such channels behave. Previous studies of single channels have suggested that they occasionally open to subconducting states at low cGMP, but the significance of these states and how they arise is poorly understood. Here we combine the high resolution of single-channel recording with the use of a photoaffinity analogue of cGMP that tethers cGMP moieties covalently to their binding sites to show single retinal CNG channels can be effectively locked in four distinct ligand-bound states. Our results indicate that channels open more than they would spontaneously when two ligands are bound (approximately 1% of the maximum current), significantly more with three ligands bound (approximately 33%), and open maximally with four ligands bound. In each ligand-bound state, channels opened to two or three different conductance states. These findings place strong constraints on the activation mechanism of CNG channels.
Although iron is required to sustain life, its free concentration and metabolism have to be tightly regulated. This is achieved through a variety of iron-binding proteins including transferrin and ferritin. During infection, bacteria acquire much of their iron from the host by synthesizing siderophores that scavenge iron and transport it into the pathogen. We recently demonstrated that enterochelin, a bacterial catecholate siderophore, binds to the host protein lipocalin 2 (ref. 5). Here, we show that this event is pivotal in the innate immune response to bacterial infection. Upon encountering invading bacteria the Toll-like receptors on immune cells stimulate the transcription, translation and secretion of lipocalin 2; secreted lipocalin 2 then limits bacterial growth by sequestrating the iron-laden siderophore. Our finding represents a new component of the innate immune system and the acute phase response to infection.
A general initiation factor, TFIIE, is essential for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in conjunction with other general factors. TFIIE is a heterotetramer containing two subunits of relative molecular mass 57,000 (TFIIE-alpha) and two of 34,000 (TFIIE-beta). TFIIE-beta is required in conjunction with TFIIE-alpha for transcription initiation. Here we report the cloning and expression of a complementary DNA encoding a functional human TFIIE-beta. Recombinant TFIIE-beta could replace the natural TFIIE-beta for transcription in conjunction with TFIIE-alpha. Amino-acid sequence comparisons reveal regions with sequence similarities to: subregion 3 of bacterial sigma factors; a region of RAP30 (the small subunit of TFIIF) with sequence similarity to a sigma-factor subregion implicated in binding to RNA polymerase; and a portion of the basic region-helix-loop-helix motif found in several enhancer-binding proteins. These potential homologies have implications for the role of TFIIE in preinitiation complex assembly and function.
The small guanine nucleotide binding protein Ras participates in a growth promoting signal transduction pathway. The mechanism by which interaction of Ras with the protein kinase Raf leads to activation of Raf was studied. Raf was targeted to the plasma membrane by addition of the COOH-terminal localization signals of K-ras. This modified form of Raf (RafCAAX) was activated to the same extent as Raf coexpressed with oncogenic mutant Ras. Plasma membrane localization rather than farnesylation or the presence of the additional COOH-terminal sequence accounted for the activation of RafCAAX. The activation of RafCAAX was completely independent of Ras; it was neither potentiated by oncogenic mutant Ras nor abrogated by dominant negative Ras. Raf, once recruited to the plasma membrane, was not anchored there by Ras; most activated Raf in cells was associated with plasma membrane cytoskeletal elements, not the lipid bilayer. Thus, Ras functions in the activation of Raf by recruiting Raf to the plasma membrane where a separate, Ras-independent, activation of Raf occurs.
The chaperonin GroEL is a double-ring structure with a central cavity in each ring that provides an environment for the efficient folding of proteins when capped by the co-chaperone GroES in the presence of adenine nucleotides. Productive folding of the substrate rhodanese has been observed in cis ternary complexes, where GroES and polypeptide are bound to the same ring, formed with either ATP, ADP or non-hydrolysable ATP analogues, suggesting that the specific requirement for ATP is confined to an action in the trans ring that evicts GroES and polypeptide from the cis side. We show here, however, that for the folding of malate dehydrogenase and Rubisco there is also an absolute requirement for ATP in the cis ring, as ADP and AMP-PNP are unable to promote folding. We investigated the specific roles of binding and hydrolysis of ATP in the cis and trans rings using mutant forms of GroEL that bind ATP but are defective in its hydrolysis. Binding of ATP and GroES in cis initiated productive folding inside a highly stable GroEL-ATP-GroES complex. To discharge GroES and polypeptide, ATP hydrolysis in the cis ring was required to form a GroEL-ADP-GroES complex with decreased stability, priming the cis complex for release by ATP binding (without hydrolysis) in the trans ring. These observations offer an explanation of why GroEL functions as a double-ring complex.
Transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB), consisting of the TATA-binding protein (TBP), TFIIB-related factor (Brf1) and Bdp1, is a central component in basal and regulated transcription by RNA polymerase III. TFIIIB recruits its polymerase to the promoter and subsequently has an essential role in the formation of the open initiation complex. The amino-terminal half of Brf1 shares a high degree of sequence similarity with the polymerase II general transcription factor TFIIB, but it is the carboxy-terminal half of Brf1 that contributes most of its binding affinity with TBP. The principal anchoring region is located between residues 435 and 545 of yeast Brf1, comprising its homology domain II. The same region also provides the primary interface for assembling Bdp1 into the TFIIIB complex. We report here a 2.95 A resolution crystal structure of the ternary complex containing Brf1 homology domain II, the conserved region of TBP and 19 base pairs of U6 promoter DNA. The structure reveals the core interface for assembly of TFIIIB and demonstrates how the loosely packed Brf1 domain achieves remarkable binding specificity with the convex and lateral surfaces of TBP.
We report the molecular cloning and sequence of a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), an enzyme that is of particular interest because of its central role in cell signal transduction. The signals in question are those delivered by hormones to their cell-surface receptors that activate PI-PLC by means of a guanine nucleotide binding protein. Activation of the enzyme leads to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to two second messengers, 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, the second of which ultimately mobilizes internal pools of calcium. There are at least five PI-PLC isoenzymes, whose differences in structure and function are unknown. We have focused on isoenzyme I, which we have recently purified and characterized from guinea pig uterus. We have now determined the sequence of a full length complementary DNA of this isoenzyme from the rat. Although the sequence has little similarity with the only other sequenced PI-PLC isoenzyme, it has a surprising degree of similarity to thioredoxins, protein co-factors in thiol-dependent redox reactions.
The ribonucleocapsids of many plant viruses are extremely stable. The protein coat protects the RNA genome against degradation during the accumulation and spread of progeny virions. Chimeric single-stranded RNA molecules were transcribed in vitro from recombinant plasmids and later encapsidated, in vitro, into ribonucleoprotein particles (pseudoviruses) 60 nanometers long that resembled tobacco mosaic virus. Transcripts encoding an assayable enzyme, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), were packaged into pseudovirus particles to assess the utility of this single-stranded RNA delivery system in a wide range of cell types. In all cases, packaged CAT messenger RNA was uncoated and transiently expressed. Significantly higher levels of CAT activity were detected with packaged than with naked CAT messenger RNA after inoculation of plant protoplasts in the presence of polyethylene glycol or abrasive inoculation of intact leaf surfaces. Structural events that lead to the uncoating and expression of CAT messenger RNA showed no cell specificity. This observation may support the view that the comparatively restricted host range of a true plant virus results from events that occur later during the infection cycle.
U2 small nuclear RNA is a highly conserved component of the eukaryotic cell nucleus involved in splicing messenger RNA precursors. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, U2 RNA interacts with the intron by RNA-RNA pairing between the conserved branchpoint sequence UACUAAC and conserved nucleotides near the 5' end of U2 (ref. 4). Metazoan U2 RNA is less than 200 nucleotides in length, but yeast U2 RNA is 1,175 nucleotides long. The 5' 110 nucleotides of yeast U2 are homologous to the 5' 100 nucleotides of metazoan U2 (ref. 6), and the very 3' end of yeast U2 bears a weak structural resemblance to features near the 3' end of metazoan U2. Internal sequences of yeast U2 share primary sequence homology with metazoan U4, U5 and U6 small nuclear RNA (ref. 6), and have regions of complementarity with yeast U1 (ref. 7). We have investigated the importance of the internal U2 sequences by their deletion. Yeast cells carrying a U2 allele lacking 958 nucleotides of internal U2 sequence produce a U2 small nuclear RNA similar in size to that found in other organisms. Cells carrying only the U2 deletion grow normally, have normal levels of spliced mRNA and do not accumulate unspliced precursor mRNA. We conclude that the internal sequences of yeast U2 carry no essential function. The extra RNA may have a non-essential function in efficient ribonucleoprotein assembly or RNA stability. Variation in amount of RNA in homologous structural RNAs has precedence in ribosomal RNA and RNaseP.
Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase/phosphatase is a bifunctional, thermostable enzyme that catalyses two subsequent steps in gluconeogenesis in most archaea and in deeply branching bacterial lineages. It mediates the aldol condensation of heat-labile dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to FBP, as well as the subsequent, irreversible hydrolysis of the product to yield the stable fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and inorganic phosphate; no reaction intermediates are released. Here we present a series of structural snapshots of the reaction that reveal a substantial remodelling of the active site through the movement of loop regions that create different catalytic functionalities at the same location. We have solved the three-dimensional structures of FBP aldolase/phosphatase from thermophilic Thermoproteus neutrophilus in a ligand-free state as well as in complex with the substrates DHAP and FBP and the product F6P to resolutions up to 1.3 A. In conjunction with mutagenesis data, this pinpoints the residues required for the two reaction steps and shows that the sequential binding of additional Mg(2+) cations reversibly facilitates the reaction. FBP aldolase/phosphatase is an ancestral gluconeogenic enzyme optimized for high ambient temperatures, and our work resolves how consecutive structural rearrangements reorganize the catalytic centre of the protein to carry out two canonical reactions in a very non-canonical type of bifunctionality.
N-linked oligosaccharides arise when blocks of 14 sugars are added cotranslationally to newly synthesized polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These glycans are then subjected to extensive modification as the glycoproteins mature and move through the ER via the Golgi complex to their final destinations inside and outside the cell. In the ER and in the early secretory pathway, where the repertoire of oligosaccharide structures is still rather small, the glycans play a pivotal role in protein folding, oligomerization, quality control, sorting, and transport. They are used as universal "tags" that allow specific lectins and modifying enzymes to establish order among the diversity of maturing glycoproteins. In the Golgi complex, the glycans acquire more complex structures and a new set of functions. The division of synthesis and processing between the ER and the Golgi complex represents an evolutionary adaptation that allows efficient exploitation of the potential of oligosaccharides.
Several classes of proteolytic enzymes have been proposed to have a role in the processing of precursor forms of proproteins at paired basic amino acid residues. In higher eukaryotes, a single endopeptidase has yet to fulfill the necessary criteria as the physiologically relevant convertase. The observation of proalbumin circulating in a child with a bleeding disorder caused by an unusual alpha 1-antitrypsin mutation led to speculation that the presence of this alpha 1-antitrypsin mutant was inhibitory to the convertase. This provided an additional means of characterizing the processing enzyme. In this study the yeast KEX2 enzyme, a calcium-dependent thiol protease, was found to have all the properties expected for this processing enzyme. KEX2 correctly recognized and cleaved the prosequence in proalbumin. In addition, KEX2 was specifically inhibited by the mutant alpha 1-antitrypsin but not by other serine protease inhibitors.
The cross-linking of lysozyme by reaction with phenol-2,4-disulfonyl chloride has been effected. The cross-linked protein retained enzymatic activity, has approximately the same molecular weight as native lysozyme, and has essentially the same conformation as native lysozyme as judged by optical rotatory dispersion analysis. The positions of sulfonylation were assigned by a standard degradation sequence; the presence of sulfonamide bonds was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Cross-links may thus be introduced without incurring major structural changes in the protein, and certain intramolecular distances that are allowed in the active enzyme may be deduced.
The activated heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein Gk, at subpicomolar concentrations, mimics muscarinic stimulation of a specific atrial potassium current. Reconstitution studies have implicated the alpha and beta gamma subunits as mediators, but subunit coupling by the endogenous G protein has not been analyzed. To study this process, a monoclonal antibody (4A) that binds to alpha k but not to beta gamma was applied to the solution bathing an inside-out patch of atrial membrane; the antibody blocked carbachol-activated currents irreversibly. The state of the endogenous Gk determined its susceptibility to block by the antibody. When agonist was absent or when activation by muscarinic stimulation was interrupted by withdrawal of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in the presence or absence of guanosine diphosphate (GDP), the effects of the antibody did not persist. Thus, monoclonal antibody 4A blocked muscarinic activation of potassium channels by binding to the activated G protein in its holomeric form or by binding to the dissociated alpha subunit.
The administration to rats of the ethyl analog of methionine, ethionine, results in the rapid decrease in the hepatic concentration of adenosine triphosphate followed by an extensive disaggregation of polysomes to ribosome monomers and a concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis. These effects are readily reversed by the injection of methionine or precursors of adenine nucleotides such as adenine. The reformation of liver polyribosomes in such animals following the administration of adenine plus methionine was found to occur under conditions in which new RNA synthesis was markedly inhibited. Free messenger RNA without attached ribosomes must be capable of remaining functionally active in the liver cytoplasm for many hours.
Engulfment and subsequent degradation of apoptotic cells is an essential step that occurs throughout life in all multicellular organisms. ELMO/Dock180/Rac proteins are a conserved signalling module for promoting the internalization of apoptotic cell corpses; ELMO and Dock180 function together as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac, and thereby regulate the phagocyte actin cytoskeleton during engulfment. However, the receptor(s) upstream of the ELMO/Dock180/Rac module are still unknown. Here we identify brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) as a receptor upstream of ELMO and as a receptor that can bind phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. BAI1 is a seven-transmembrane protein belonging to the adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptor family, with an extended extracellular region and no known ligands. We show that BAI1 functions as an engulfment receptor in both the recognition and subsequent internalization of apoptotic cells. Through multiple lines of investigation, we identify phosphatidylserine, a key 'eat-me' signal exposed on apoptotic cells, as a ligand for BAI1. The thrombospondin type 1 repeats within the extracellular region of BAI1 mediate direct binding to phosphatidylserine. As with intracellular signalling, BAI1 forms a trimeric complex with ELMO and Dock180, and functional studies suggest that BAI1 cooperates with ELMO/Dock180/Rac to promote maximal engulfment of apoptotic cells. Last, decreased BAI1 expression or interference with BAI1 function inhibits the engulfment of apoptotic targets ex vivo and in vivo. Thus, BAI1 is a phosphatidylserine recognition receptor that can directly recruit a Rac-GEF complex to mediate the uptake of apoptotic cells.
When template DNA is saturated with a single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), strings of three or four contiguous hexanucleotides (hexamers) can cooperate through base-stacking interactions to prime DNA synthesis specifically from the 3' end of the string. Under the same conditions, priming by individual hexamers is suppressed. Strings of three of four hexamers representing more than 200 of the 4096 possible hexamers primed easily readable sequence ladders at more than 75 different sites in single-stranded or denatured double-stranded templates 6.4 kilobases to 40 kilobase pairs long, with a success rate of 60 to 90 percent. A synthesis of 1 micromole of hexamer supplies enough material for thousands of primings, so multiple libraries of all 4096 hexamers could be distributed at a reasonable cost. Such libraries would allow rapid and economical sequencing. Automating this strategy could increase the speed and efficiency of large-scale DNA sequencing by at least an order of magnitude.
Kinesin is a two-headed, ATP-dependent motor protein that moves along microtubules in discrete steps of 8 nm. In vitro, single molecules produce processive movement; motors typically take approximately 100 steps before releasing from a microtubule. A central question relates to mechanochemical coupling in this enzyme: how many molecules of ATP are consumed per step? For the actomyosin system, experimental approaches to this issue have generated considerable controversy. Here we take advantage of the processivity of kinesin to determine the coupling ratio without recourse to direct measurements of ATPase activity, which are subject to large experimental uncertainties. Beads carrying single molecules of kinesin moving on microtubules were tracked with high spatial and temporal resolution by interferometry. Statistical analysis of the intervals between steps at limiting ATP, and studies of fluctuations in motor speed as a function of ATP concentration, allow the coupling ratio to be determined. At near-zero load, kinesin molecules hydrolyse a single ATP molecule per 8-nm advance. This finding excludes various one-to-many and many-to-one coupling schemes, analogous to those advanced for myosin, and places severe constraints on models for movement.
Complementary DNA clones, encoding the LH-hCG (luteinizing hormone-human choriogonadotropic hormone) receptor were isolated by screening a lambda gt11 library with monoclonal antibodies. The primary structure of the protein was deduced from the DNA sequence analysis; the protein contains 696 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 27 amino acids. Hydropathy analysis suggests the existence of seven transmembrane domains that show homology with the corresponding regions of other G protein-coupled receptors. Three other types of clones corresponding to shorter proteins were observed, in which the putative transmembrane domain was absent. These probably arose through alternative splicing. RNA blot analysis showed similar patterns in testis and ovary with a major RNA of 4700 nucleotides and several minor species. The messenger RNA was expressed in COS-7 cells, yielding a protein that bound hCG with the same affinity as the testicular receptor.
DNA-damage-induced SOS mutations arise when Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (pol) V, activated by a RecA nucleoprotein filament (RecA*), catalyses translesion DNA synthesis. Here we address two longstanding enigmatic aspects of SOS mutagenesis, the molecular composition of mutagenically active pol V and the role of RecA*. We show that RecA* transfers a single RecA-ATP stoichiometrically from its DNA 3'-end to free pol V (UmuD'(2)C) to form an active mutasome (pol V Mut) with the composition UmuD'(2)C-RecA-ATP. Pol V Mut catalyses TLS in the absence of RecA* and deactivates rapidly upon dissociation from DNA. Deactivation occurs more slowly in the absence of DNA synthesis, while retaining RecA-ATP in the complex. Reactivation of pol V Mut is triggered by replacement of RecA-ATP from RecA*. Thus, the principal role of RecA* in SOS mutagenesis is to transfer RecA-ATP to pol V, and thus generate active mutasomal complex for translesion synthesis.
The insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is a polypeptide hormone with structural homologies to insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). In contrast to these other hormones, the in vivo function of IGF-II is not known. Although IGF-II can stimulate a broad range of biological responses in isolated cells, these responses have usually been found to be mediated by the insulin and IGF-I receptors. Recently, the receptor for IGF-II was found to also be the receptor for mannose-6-phosphate. Since this latter receptor has been implicated in targeting of lysosomal enzymes, the question is now raised of whether the same protein can also mediate metabolic responses to IGF-II.
Identification of the mechanisms by which the coagulation protease thrombin activates platelets is critical for understanding haemostasis and thrombosis. Thrombin activates cells at least in part by cleaving protease-activated G-protein-coupled receptors (PARs). PAR3 and PAR4 are thrombin receptors expressed in mouse platelets. Inhibition of thrombin binding to mPAR3 (ref. 4) and knockout of the mPAR3 gene inhibited mouse platelet activation at low but not high concentrations of thrombin. Thus PAR3 is important for thrombin signalling in mouse platelets. Expression of human PAR3 in heterologous expression systems reliably resulted in responsiveness to thrombin. Curiously, despite its importance for the activation of mouse platelets by thrombin, mouse PAR3 (mPAR3) did not lead to thrombin signalling even when overexpressed. We now report that mPAR3 and mPAR4 interact in a novel way: mPAR3 does not itself mediate transmembrane signalling but instead functions as a cofactor for the cleavage and activation of mPAR4 by thrombin. This establishes a paradigm for cofactor-assisted PAR activation and for a G-protein-coupled receptor's acting as an accessory molecule to present ligand to another receptor.
Membrane fission is essential in intracellular transport. Acyl-coenzyme As (acyl-CoAs) are important in lipid remodelling and are required for fission of COPI-coated vesicles. Here we show that CtBP/BARS, a protein that functions in the dynamics of Golgi tubules, is an essential component of the fission machinery operating at Golgi tubular networks, including Golgi compartments involved in protein transport and sorting. CtBP/BARS-induced fission was preceded by the formation of constricted sites in Golgi tubules, whose extreme curvature is likely to involve local changes in the membrane lipid composition. We find that CtBP/BARS uses acyl-CoA to selectively catalyse the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid both in pure lipidic systems and in Golgi membranes, and that this reaction is essential for fission. Our results indicate a key role for lipid metabolic pathways in membrane fission.
Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms contain DNA bridging proteins, which can have regulatory or architectural functions. The molecular and mechanical details of such proteins are hard to obtain, in particular if they involve non-specific interactions. The bacterial nucleoid consists of hundreds of DNA loops, shaped in part by non-specific DNA bridging proteins such as histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS), leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins. We have developed an optical tweezers instrument that can independently handle two DNA molecules, which allows the systematic investigation of protein-mediated DNA-DNA interactions. Here we use this technique to investigate the abundant non-specific nucleoid-associated protein H-NS, and show that H-NS is dynamically organized between two DNA molecules in register with their helical pitch. Our optical tweezers also allow us to carry out dynamic force spectroscopy on non-specific DNA binding proteins and thereby to determine an energy landscape for the H-NS-DNA interaction. Our results explain how the bacterial nucleoid can be effectively compacted and organized, but be dynamic in nature and accessible to DNA-tracking motor enzymes. Finally, our experimental approach is widely applicable to other DNA bridging proteins, as well as to complex DNA interactions involving multiple DNA molecules.
Calcium-dependent protease (calcium protease) is apparently involved in a variety of cellular processes. Here we have attempted to clarify the role and regulatory mechanism of calcium protease by analysing its structure. The complete primary structure of calcium protease (relative molecular mass (Mr) 80,000 (80K), 705 amino acids) was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of cloned complementary DNA. The protein contains four distinct domains, and we have observed a marked similarity between the second and fourth domains and the papain-like thiol proteases and calmodulin-like calcium-binding proteins, respectively. This finding suggests that calcium protease arose from the fusion of genes for proteins of completely different function and evolutionary origin. Further, it provides functional insight into cellular regulatory mechanisms mediated by Ca2+ through calcium-binding proteins.
The nucleotide sequence of a DNA complementary to human growth hormone messenger RNA was cloned; it contains 29 nucleotides in its 5' untranslated region, the 651 nucleotides coding for the prehormone, and the entire 3' untranslated region (108 nucleotides). The data reported predict the previously unknown sequence of the signal peptide of human growth hormone and, by comparison with the previously determined sequences of rat growth hormone and human chorionic somatomammotropin, strengthens the hypothesis that these genes evolved by gene duplication from a common ancestral sequence. The human growth hormone gene sequences have been linked in phase to a fragment of the trp D gene of Escherichia coli in a plasmid vehicle, and a fusion protein is synthesized at high level (approximately 3 percent of bacterial protein) under the control of the regulatory region of the trp operon. This fusion protein (70 percent of whose amino acids are coded for by the human growth hormone gene) reacts specifically with antibodies to human growth hormone and is stable in E. coli.
Protein modification by the conjugation of ubiquitin moieties--ubiquitination--plays a major part in many biological processes, including cell cycle and apoptosis. The enzymes that mediate ubiquitin-conjugation have been well-studied, but much less is known about the ubiquitin-specific proteases that mediate de-ubiquitination of cellular substrates. To study this gene family, we designed a collection of RNA interference vectors to suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes, and used these vectors to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways. We report here that inhibition of one of these enzymes, the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), having no known function, enhances activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We show that CYLD binds to the NEMO (also known as IKKgamma) component of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, and appears to regulate its activity through de-ubiquitination of TRAF2, as TRAF2 ubiquitination can be modulated by CYLD. Inhibition of CYLD increases resistance to apoptosis, suggesting a mechanism through which loss of CYLD contributes to oncogenesis. We show that this effect can be relieved by aspirin derivatives that inhibit NF-kappaB activity, which suggests a therapeutic intervention strategy to restore growth control in patients suffering from familial cylindromatosis.
Eight classes of human leukocyte interferon (LeIFN) cDNA clones have been identified in a cDNA library prepared from a myeloblastoid cell line. The nucleotide sequences demonstrate that the multiple human LeIFN genes code for a family of homologous, yet distinct proteins. One of the cDNA clones may have been derived from the transcription of a LeIFN pseudogene.
Extended analogs of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), in which a peroxide bridge replaces the terminal bridge-oxygen of the triphosphate chain, have been synthesized. The ability of beta, gamma-peroxy-ATP to inhibit or substitute for ATP in representative enzyme systems and that of beta, gamma-peroxy-GTP, for FTP in protein synthesis was tested.
Cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) complexes are essential activators of cell cycle progression in all eukaryotes. In contrast to mammalian cells, in which multiple cdk's contribute to cell cycle regulation, the yeast cell cycle is largely controlled by the activity of a single cdk, CDC28. Analysis of the putative G1 cyclin PCL2 (ORFD) identified a second cyclin-cdk complex that contributes to cell cycle progression in yeast. PCL2 interacted with the cdk PHO85 in vivo and in vitro and formed a kinase complex that had G1-periodic activity. Under genetic conditions in which the Start transition was compromised, PHO85 and its associated cyclin subunits were essential for cell cycle commitment. Because PHO85 and another cyclin-like molecule, PHO80, also take part in inorganic phosphate metabolism, this cdk enzyme may integrate responses to nutritional conditions with the cell cycle.
Lethal factor (LF) is a protein (relative molecular mass 90,000) that is critical in the pathogenesis of anthrax. It is a highly specific protease that cleaves members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) family near to their amino termini, leading to the inhibition of one or more signalling pathways. Here we describe the crystal structure of LF and its complex with the N terminus of MAPKK-2. LF comprises four domains: domain I binds the membrane-translocating component of anthrax toxin, the protective antigen (PA); domains II, III and IV together create a long deep groove that holds the 16-residue N-terminal tail of MAPKK-2 before cleavage. Domain II resembles the ADP-ribosylating toxin from Bacillus cereus, but the active site has been mutated and recruited to augment substrate recognition. Domain III is inserted into domain II, and seems to have arisen from a repeated duplication of a structural element of domain II. Domain IV is distantly related to the zinc metalloprotease family, and contains the catalytic centre; it also resembles domain I. The structure thus reveals a protein that has evolved through a process of gene duplication, mutation and fusion, into an enzyme with high and unusual specificity.
The ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase synthesizes telomeric DNA by copying an internal RNA template sequence. The telomerase activities of the yeasts Saccharomyces castellii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae--with regular and irregular telomeric sequences, respectively--have now been identified and characterized. The S. cerevisiae activity required the telomerase RNA gene TLC1 but not the EST1 gene, both of which are required for normal telomere maintenance in vivo. This activity exhibited low processivity and produced no regularly repeated products. An inherently high stalling frequency of the S. cerevisiae telomerase may account for its in vitro properties and for the irregular telomeric sequences of this yeast.
Werner's syndrome (WS) is an inherited disease with clinical symptoms resembling premature aging. Early susceptibility to a number of major age-related diseases is a key feature of this disorder. The gene responsible for WS (known as WRN) was identified by positional cloning. The predicted protein is 1432 amino acids in length and shows significant similarity to DNA helicases. Four mutations in WS patients were identified. Two of the mutations are splice-junction mutations, with the predicted result being the exclusion of exons from the final messenger RNA. One of the these mutations, which results in a frameshift and a predicted truncated protein, was found in the homozygous state in 60 percent of Japanese WS patients examined. The other two mutations are nonsense mutations. The identification of a mutated putative helicase as the gene product of the WS gene suggests that defective DNA metabolism is involved in the complex process of aging in WS patients.
Mast cells undergo an extensive and violent morphological transformation on stimulation. Here we describe the dynamics of fusion of the secretory granules in individual mast cells during exocytosis. The cell membrane capacitance (proportional to the cell surface area) was measured using the whole-cell patch-pipette technique, in which the intracellular space is dialysed with the solutions used to fill the patch pipette. Our results show that degranulation occurs spontaneously and reproducibly if the GTP analogue, GTP-gamma-S, and Mg-ATP are present in the pipette filling solution. Contrary to previous reports, in these conditions Ca2+ (and/or Ca2+ buffers) is not required for degranulation. Although electrogenic Ca2+ entry was not detected before or during degranulation and membrane conductance remained low, the capacitance, and by implication the area of the membrane of degranulating cells, increased sigmoidally and stepwise. We conclude that stepwise increases of capacitance are due to the fusion of individual secretory granules with the plasma membrane, and that guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins are involved in the control of this process.
An intracellular coenzyme has been observed by carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The pyridine nucleotides in Escherichia coli were specifically labeled with carbon-13 from the biosynthetic precursor, nicotinic acid. The intracellular redox status and metabolic transformations of the pyridine nucleotides were examined under a variety of conditions. A highly reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide pool was observed under anaerobic conditions only in cells that were cultured aerobically on glycerol.
The levels of activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, isocitric dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, lactic dehydrogenase, and a-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase have been studied in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice with "dystrophia muscularis." The activity of enzymes requiring triphosphopyridine nucleotide as a cofactor is increased relative to the control littermates, whereas the activity of those enzymes requiring diphosphopyridine nucleotide is decreased.
The ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase adds telomeric DNA onto chromosome ends and is normally regulated so that telomeric DNA lengths are kept within defined bounds. In the telomerase RNA gene from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, specific mutations that alter telomeric DNA sequences result in telomeres elongating to up to 100 times their normal length and impair cell growth. Some mutations cause immediate elongation whereas others behave like genetic time bombs, causing elongation only after a latent period of hundreds of generations.
Increasing concentrations of sodium octanoate were progressively inhibitory to the activities of glucokinase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. Glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases were also markedly inhibited. Other enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism such as lactate dehydrogenase, phosphohexose isomerase, and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase were not decreased. Among the key glycolytic enzymes, the inhibition of pyruvate kinase by the fatty acid was most marked. The biological significance of the inhibition of the key glycolytic enzymes is interpreted as a feedback inhibitory mechanism in regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. The mechanism may function for rapid adaptation by which the organism can use the fatty acid level as a metabolic directional switch in decreasing glycolysis and turning on gluconeogenesis.
Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) enhance transcription of specific genes in response to cytokines and growth factors. STAT1 is also required for efficient constitutive expression of the caspases Ice, Cpp32, and Ich-1 in human fibroblasts. As a consequence, STAT1-null cells are resistant to apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Reintroduction of STAT1alpha restored both TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and the expression of Ice, Cpp32, and Ich-1. Variant STAT1 proteins carrying point mutations that inactivate domains required for STAT dimer formation nevertheless restored protease expression and sensitivity to apoptosis, indicating that the functions of STAT1 required for these activities are different from those that mediate induced gene expression.
Formin homology proteins (formins) elongate actin filaments (F-actin) by continuously associating with filament tips, potentially harnessing actin-generated pushing forces. During this processive elongation, formins are predicted to rotate along the axis of the double helical F-actin structure (referred to here as helical rotation), although this has not yet been definitively shown. We demonstrated helical rotation of the formin mDia1 by single-molecule fluorescence polarization (FL(P)). FL(P) of labeled F-actin, both elongating and depolymerizing from immobilized mDia1, oscillated with a periodicity corresponding to that of the F-actin long-pitch helix, and this was not altered by actin-bound nucleotides or the actin-binding protein profilin. Thus, helical rotation is an intrinsic property of formins. To harness pushing forces from growing F-actin, formins must be anchored flexibly to cell structures.
The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is initiated by processing long double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA-generating enzyme was purified from Drosophila S2cells and consists of two stoichiometric subunits: Dicer-2(DCR-2) and a previously unknown protein that we named R2D2. R2D2 is homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans RNAi protein RDE-4. Association with R2D2 does not affect the enzymatic activity of DCR-2. Rather, the DCR-2/R2D2 complex, but not DCR-2 alone, binds to siRNA and enhances sequence-specific messenger RNA degradation mediated by the RNA-initiated silencing complex (RISC). These results indicate that R2D2 bridges the initiation and effector steps of the Drosophila RNAi pathway by facilitating siRNA passage from Dicer to RISC.
Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) may be grouped into distinct families of proteins that catalyse the hydrolysis of the 2-acyl bond of phospholipids and perform a variety of biological functions. The best characterized are the small (relative molecular mass approximately 14,000) calcium-dependent, secretory enzymes of diverse origin, such as pancreatic and venom PLA2s. The structures and functions of several PLA2s are known. Recently, high-resolution crystal structures of complexes of secretory PLA2s with phosphonate phospholipid analogues have provided information about the detailed stereochemistry of transition-state binding, confirming the proposed catalytic mechanism of esterolysis. By contrast, studies on mammalian nonpancreatic secretory PLA2s (s-PLA2s) have only recently begun; s-PLA2s are scarce in normal cells and tissues but large amounts are found in association with local and systemic inflammatory processes and tissue injury in animals and man. Such s-PLAs have been purified from rabbit and rat inflammatory exudate, from synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and from human platelets. Cloning and sequencing shows that the primary structure of the human s-PLA2 has about 37% homology with that of bovine pancreatic PLA2 and 44% homology with that of Crotalus atrox PLA2. The human s-PLA2 is an unusually basic protein, yet contains most of the highly conserved amino-acid residues and sequences characteristic of the PLA2s sequenced so far. Here we report the refined, three-dimensional crystal structure at 2.2 A resolution of recombinant human rheumatoid arthritic synovial fluid PLA2. This may aid the development of potent and specific inhibitors of this enzyme using structure-based design.
The association between obesity and diabetes supports an endocrine role for the adipocyte in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Here we report that mice lacking the adipocyte hormone resistin exhibit low blood glucose levels after fasting, due to reduced hepatic glucose production. This is partly mediated by activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and decreased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver. The data thus support a physiological function for resistin in the maintenance of blood glucose during fasting. Remarkably, lack of resistin diminishes the increase in post-fast blood glucose normally associated with increased weight, suggesting a role for resistin in mediating hyperglycemia associated with obesity.
The Son of sevenless (Sos) protein functions as a guanine nucleotide transfer factor for Ras and interacts with the receptor tyrosine kinase Sevenless through the protein Drk, a homolog of mammalian Grb2. In vivo structure-function analysis revealed that the amino terminus of Sos was essential for its function in flies. A molecule lacking the amino terminus was a potent dominant negative. In contrast, a Sos fragment lacking the Drk binding sites was functional and its activity was dependent on the presence of the Sevenless receptor. Furthermore, membrane localization of Sos was independent of Drk. A possible role for Drk as an activator of Sos is discussed and a Drk-independent interaction between Sos and Sevenless is proposed that is likely mediated by the pleckstrin homology domain within the amino terminus.
The expression of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerases pol V (UmuD'2C complex) and pol IV (DinB) increases in response to DNA damage. The induction of pol V is accompanied by a substantial increase in mutations targeted at DNA template lesions in a process called SOS-induced error-prone repair. Here we show that the common DNA template lesions, TT (6-4) photoproducts, TT cis-syn photodimers and abasic sites, are efficiently bypassed within 30 seconds by pol V in the presence of activated RecA protein (RecA*), single-stranded binding protein (SSB) and pol III's processivity beta,gamma-complex. There is no detectable bypass by either pol IV or pol III on this time scale. A mutagenic 'signature' for pol V is its incorporation of guanine opposite the 3'-thymine of a TT (6-4) photoproduct, in agreement with mutational spectra. In contrast, pol III and pol IV incorporate adenine almost exclusively. When copying undamaged DNA, pol V exhibits low fidelity with error rates of around 10(-3) to 10(-4), with pol IV being 5- to 10-fold more accurate. The effects of RecA protein on pol V, and beta,gamma-complex on pol IV, cause a 15,000- and 3,000-fold increase in DNA synthesis efficiency, respectively. However, both polymerases exhibit low processivity, adding 6 to 8 nucleotides before dissociating. Lesion bypass by pol V does not require beta,gamma-complex in the presence of non-hydrolysable ATPgammaS, indicating that an intact RecA filament may be required for translesion synthesis.
The protection of cells in the upper intestine against digestion by pancreatic trypsin depends on the prostanoid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and is mediated by protease-activated receptors in the epithelium. As the airway epithelium is morphologically similar and also expresses one of these receptors, PAR2, and is a major source of PGE2, we reasoned that bronchial epithelial PAR2 might also participate in prostanoid-dependent cytoprotection in the airways. Here we show that activation of PAR2, which co-localizes immunohistochemically with trypsin(ogen) in airway epithelium, causes the relaxation of airway preparations from mouse, rat, guinea-pig and humans by the release of a cyclooxygenase product from the epithelium. This physiological protective response in isolated airways also occurred in anaesthetized rats, where activation of PAR2 caused a marked and prolonged inhibition of bronchoconstriction. After desensitization of PAR2, the response to trypsin recovered rapidly by mechanisms dependent on de novo synthesis and trafficking of proteins. Our results indicate that trypsin released from the epithelium can initiate powerful bronchoprotection in the airways by activation of epithelial PAR2.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an outer-membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria, interacts with LPS-binding protein and CD14, which present LPS to toll-like receptor 4 (refs 1, 2), which activates inflammatory gene expression through nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) and mitogen-activated protein-kinase signalling. Antibacterial defence involves activation of neutrophils that generate reactive oxygen species capable of killing bacteria; therefore host lipid peroxidation occurs, initiated by enzymes such as NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase. Oxidized phospholipids are pro-inflammatory agonists promoting chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis; however, recent data suggest that they can inhibit expression of inflammatory adhesion molecules. Here we show that oxidized phospholipids inhibit LPS-induced but not tumour-necrosis factor-alpha-induced or interleukin-1 beta-induced NF kappa B-mediated upregulation of inflammatory genes, by blocking the interaction of LPS with LPS-binding protein and CD14. Moreover, in LPS-injected mice, oxidized phospholipids inhibited inflammation and protected mice from lethal endotoxin shock. Thus, in severe Gram-negative bacterial infection, endogenously formed oxidized phospholipids may function as a negative feedback to blunt innate immune responses. Furthermore, identified chemical structures capable of inhibiting the effects of endotoxins such as LPS could be used for the development of new drugs for treatment of sepsis.
TRAF6 is a signal transducer that activates IkappaB kinase (IKK) and Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) in response to pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). IKK activation by TRAF6 requires two intermediary factors, TRAF6-regulated IKK activator 1 (TRIKA1) and TRIKA2 (ref. 5). TRIKA1 is a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex composed of Ubc13 and Uev1A (or the functionally equivalent Mms2). This Ubc complex, together with TRAF6, catalyses the formation of a Lys 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chain that mediates IKK activation through a unique proteasome-independent mechanism. Here we report the purification and identification of TRIKA2, which is composed of TAK1, TAB1 and TAB2, a protein kinase complex previously implicated in IKK activation through an unknown mechanism. We find that the TAK1 kinase complex phosphorylates and activates IKK in a manner that depends on TRAF6 and Ubc13-Uev1A. Moreover, the activity of TAK1 to phosphorylate MKK6, which activates the JNK-p38 kinase pathway, is directly regulated by K63-linked polyubiquitination. We also provide evidence that TRAF6 is conjugated by the K63 polyubiquitin chains. These results indicate that ubiquitination has an important regulatory role in stress response pathways, including those of IKK and JNK.
Vesicular transport to and from the lysosome and late endosome is defective in patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) and in mutant beige (bg) mice. CHS and bg cells have giant, perinuclear vesicles with characteristics of late endosomes and lysosomes that arise from dysregulated homotypic fusion. CHS and bg lysosomes also exhibit compartmental missorting of proteins, such as elastase, glucuronidase and cathepsin G. Lyst, a candidate gene for bg, was identified by direct complementary DNA selection from a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone containing a 650-kilobase segment of the bg-critical region on mouse chromosome 13. Lyst is disrupted by a 5-kilobase deletion in bg mice, and Lyst messenger RNA is markedly reduced in bg homozygotes. The homologous human gene, LYST, is highly conserved with mouse Lyst, and contains a frame-shift mutation at nucleotides 117-118 of the coding domain in a CHS patient. Thus bg mice and human CHS patients have homologous disorders associated with Lyst mutations. Lyst encodes a protein with a carboxy-terminal prenylation motif and multiple potential phosphorylation sites. Lyst protein is predicted to form extended helical domains, and has a region of sequence similar to stathmin, a coiled-coil phosphoprotein thought to act as a relay integrating cellular signal response coupling.
EDG-1 is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP). Cell migration toward platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which stimulates sphingosine kinase and increases intracellular SPP, was dependent on expression of EDG-1. Deletion of edg-1 or inhibition of sphingosine kinase suppressed chemotaxis toward PDGF and also activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is essential for protrusion of lamellipodia and forward movement. Moreover, PDGF activated EDG-1, as measured by translocation of beta-arrestin and phosphorylation of EDG-1. Our results reveal a role for receptor cross-communication in which activation of a GPCR by a receptor tyrosine kinase is critical for cell motility.
Differential gene expression in the mother cell chamber of sporulating cells of Bacillus subtilis is determined in part by an RNA polymerase sigma factor called sigma K (or sigma 27). The sigma K factor was assigned as the product of the sporulation gene spoIVCB on the basis of the partial aminoterminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein. The spoIVCB gene is now shown to be a truncated gene capable of specifying only the amino terminal half of sigma K. The carboxyl terminal half is specified by another sporulation gene, spoIIIC, to which spoIVCB becomes joined inframe at an intermediate stage of sporulation by site-specific recombination within a 5-base pair repeated sequence. Juxtaposition of spoIVCB and spoIIIC need not be reversible in that the mother cell and its chromosome are discarded at the end of the developmental cycle. The rearrangement of chromosomal DNA could account for the presence of sigma K selectively in the mother cell and may be a precedent for the generation of cell type-specific regulatory proteins in other developmental systems where cells undergo terminal differentiation.
According to the hitherto accepted view, neutrophils kill ingested microorganisms by subjecting them to high concentrations of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and bringing about myeloperoxidase-catalysed halogenation. We show here that this simple scheme, which for many years has served as a satisfactory working hypothesis, is inadequate. We find that mice made deficient in neutrophil-granule proteases but normal in respect of superoxide production and iodinating capacity, are unable to resist staphylococcal and candidal infections. We also show that activation provokes the influx of an enormous concentration of ROS into the endocytic vacuole. The resulting accumulation of anionic charge is compensated for by a surge of K+ ions that cross the membrane in a pH-dependent manner. The consequent rise in ionic strength engenders the release of cationic granule proteins, including elastase and cathepsin G, from the anionic sulphated proteoglycan matrix. We show that it is the proteases, thus activated, that are primarily responsible for the destruction of the bacteria.
3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC), a member of the biotin-dependent carboxylase superfamily, is essential for the metabolism of leucine, and deficient mutations in this enzyme are linked to methylcrotonylglycinuria (MCG) and other serious diseases in humans. MCC has strong sequence conservation with propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), and their holoenzymes are both 750-kilodalton (kDa) a(6)b(6) dodecamers. Therefore the architecture of the MCC holoenzyme is expected to be highly similar to that of PCC. Here we report the crystal structures of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa MCC (PaMCC) holoenzyme, alone and in complex with coenzyme A. Surprisingly, the structures show that the architecture and overall shape of PaMCC are markedly different when compared to PCC. The a-subunits show trimeric association in the PaMCC holoenzyme, whereas they have no contacts with each other in PCC. Moreover, the positions of the two domains in the b-subunit of PaMCC are swapped relative to those in PCC. This structural information establishes a foundation for understanding the disease-causing mutations of MCC and provides new insights into the catalytic mechanism and evolution of biotin-dependent carboxylases. The large structural differences between MCC and PCC also have general implications for the relationship between sequence conservation and structural similarity.
Introns interrupt almost every eukaryotic protein-coding gene, yet how the splicing apparatus interprets the genome during messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis is poorly understood. We designed microarrays to distinguish spliced from unspliced RNA for each intron-containing yeast gene and measured genomewide effects on splicing caused by loss of 18 different mRNA processing factors. After accommodating changes in transcription and decay by using gene-specific indexes, functional relationships between mRNA processing factors can be identified through their common effects on spliced and unspliced RNA. Groups of genes with different dependencies on mRNA processing factors are also apparent. Quantitative polymerase chain reactions confirm the array-based finding that Prp17p and Prp18p are not dispensable for removal of introns with short branchpoint-to-3' splice site distances.
Blue light regulates many physiological processes in fungi, but their photoreceptors are not known. In Neurospora crassa, all light responses depend on the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain-containing transcription factor white collar-1 (wc-1). By removing the WC-1 light, oxygen, or voltage domain, a specialized PAS domain that binds flavin mononucleotide in plant phototropins, we show that light responses are abolished, including light entrainment of the circadian clock. However, the WC-1-mediated dark activation of frq remains normal in this mutant, and the circadian clock can be entrained by temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the purified Neurospora WC-1-WC-2 protein complex is associated with stoichiometric amounts of the chromophore flavin-adenine dinucleotide. Together, these observations suggest that WC-1 is the blue-light photoreceptor for the circadian clock and other light responses in Neurospora.
Rhythmic changes in histone acetylation at circadian clock genes suggest that temporal modulation of gene expression is regulated by chromatin modifications. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate a critical relationship between circadian and metabolic physiology. The nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (Ncor1) functions as an activating subunit for the chromatin modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3). Lack of Ncor1 is incompatible with life, and hence it is unknown whether Ncor1, and particularly its regulation of Hdac3, is critical for adult mammalian physiology. Here we show that specific, genetic disruption of the Ncor1-Hdac3 interaction in mice causes aberrant regulation of clock genes and results in abnormal circadian behaviour. These mice are also leaner and more insulin-sensitive owing to increased energy expenditure. Unexpectedly, loss of a functional Ncor1-Hdac3 complex in vivo does not lead to sustained increases in known catabolic genes, but instead significantly alters the oscillatory patterns of several metabolic genes, demonstrating that circadian regulation of metabolism is critical for normal energy balance. These findings indicate that activation of Hdac3 by Ncor1 is a nodal point in the epigenetic regulation of circadian and metabolic physiology.
Fluorine is the thirteenth most abundant element in the earth's crust, but fluoride concentrations in surface water are low and fluorinated metabolites are extremely rare. The fluoride ion is a potent nucleophile in its desolvated state, but is tightly hydrated in water and effectively inert. Low availability and a lack of chemical reactivity have largely excluded fluoride from biochemistry: in particular, fluorine's high redox potential precludes the haloperoxidase-type mechanism used in the metabolic incorporation of chloride and bromide ions. But fluorinated chemicals are growing in industrial importance, with applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials products. Reactive fluorination reagents requiring specialist process technologies are needed in industry and, although biological catalysts for these processes are highly sought after, only one enzyme that can convert fluoride to organic fluorine has been described. Streptomyces cattleya can form carbon-fluorine bonds and must therefore have evolved an enzyme able to overcome the chemical challenges of using aqueous fluoride. Here we report the sequence and three-dimensional structure of the first native fluorination enzyme, 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine synthase, from this organism. Both substrate and products have been observed bound to the enzyme, enabling us to propose a nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this biological fluorination reaction.
Small spherical viruses are among the simplest replicating systems in biology, yet the factors affecting their assembly, stability and disassembly are still poorly understood. A molecular switch is required for the assembly of icosahedral virus particles containing more than 60 identical subunits because strict symmetry cannot be maintained in subunit packing. All previously reported viruses with this type of structure use a portion of the capsid protein to regulate interactions between chemically equivalent but structurally distinct interfaces. We have investigated the T = 3 quasiequivalent nodaviruses, which are small non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome that infect insects, mice and fish. They undergo a well-characterized series of steps in assembly and maturation, which in some respects are similar to the picornaviruses, despite their different capsid architecture. Here we report the X-ray structure of Flock House virus at 3.0 A resolution, which reveals an ordered RNA duplex of 20 nucleotides and a protein segment that control the subunit interactions in this animal virus. The RNA interacts with a helical protein domain of the subunit that lies inside the capsid shell. One of the helices that binds the RNA is part of a 44-amino-acid polypeptide which is autocatalytically cleaved from the initial subunit translation product after virion assembly. The structure indicates that RNA associated with the cleaved polypeptide may be important in the infection process.
Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are small cytoplasmic proteins that are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner and bind to fatty acids such as oleic and retinoic acid. Mice with a null mutation in aP2, the gene encoding the adipocyte FABP, were developmentally and metabolically normal. The aP2-deficient mice developed dietary obesity but, unlike control mice, they did not develop insulin resistance or diabetes. Also unlike their obese wild-type counterparts, obese aP2-/- animals failed to express in adipose tissue tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a molecule implicated in obesity-related insulin resistance. These results indicate that aP2 is central to the pathway that links obesity to insulin resistance, possibly by linking fatty acid metabolism to expression of TNF-alpha.
Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent pro-inflammatory phospholipid that activates cells involved in inflammation. The biological activity of PAF depends on its structural features, namely an ether linkage at the sn-1 position and an acetate group at the sn-2 position. The actions of PAF are abolished by hydrolysis of the acetyl residue, a reaction catalysed by PAF acetylhydrolase. There are at least two forms of this enzyme--one intracellular and another that circulates in plasma and is likely to regulate inflammation. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of the human plasma PAF acetylhydrolase. The unique sequence contains a Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly motif commonly found in lipases. Recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase has the substrate specificity and lipoprotein association of the native enzyme, and blocks inflammation in vivo: it markedly decreases vascular leakage in pleurisy and paw oedema, suggesting that PAF acetylhydrolase might be a useful therapy for severe acute inflammation.
Modification of tyrosine residues of proteins has attracted great interest. Although phosphorylation has received most attention, tyrosine-O-sulphation is also common and has been closely investigated in the hormones gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK regulates pancreatic enzyme secretion. It is always sulphated and sulphation increases its pancreatic secretagogue activity 100-fold. By contrast, only half of gastrin molecules are tyrosine-O-sulphated and sulphation does not influence the ability of gastrin to regulate gastric acid secretion. We now report that in neonatal rat pancreas, which is the major source of gastrin in the newborn rat, gastrin is completely sulphated. Moreover, the disappearance of gastrin from the pancreas during the first weeks after birth parallels the appearance of CCK in the intestine. Since sulphation is essential for pancreatic secretagogue activity of gastrin as well as of CCK, pancreatic gastrin in the neonate may be the equivalent of intestinal CCK in the adult.
Harvey (Ha-MSV) and Kirsten (Ki-MSV) murine sarcoma viruses induce tumours in animals and transform various cells in culture because of the expression of the ras oncogene product, p21 (ref. 1). Proto-oncogenes homologous with these genes are highly conserved evolutionarily and activated ras oncogenes have been detected in many human cancers. Whether c-ras oncogenes are directly responsible for human carcinogenesis is uncertain; however, it is clear that p21 mediates virus-induced transformation, although by an unknown mechanism. Epithelial and fibroblast cell lines transformed with Ha-MSV and Ki-MSV express p21 (ref. 8) and exhibit reduced adenylate cyclase activity. Like the guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins, Ns and Ni, which mediate stimulation and inhibition, respectively, of adenylate cyclase, p21 is a membrane-associated GTP binding protein, which exhibits GTPase activity. These similarities suggest that p21 and the adenylate cyclase regulatory proteins are related in cellular function, and that p21 depresses adenylate cyclase by inhibiting the activity of Ns or acting as Ni. We have therefore now examined the structural and functional similarities between p21 and Ns and Ni and find no evidence that p21 regulates adenylate cyclase activity by acting as one of these regulatory proteins.
Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4-kinase catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of PtdIns-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns[4,5]P2). Hydrolysis of PtdIns[4,5]P2 in response to extracellular stimuli is thought to initiate intracellular signaling cascades that modulate cell proliferation and differentiation. The PIK1 gene encoding a PtdIns 4-kinase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotides based on the sequence of peptides derived from the purified enzyme. The sequence of the PIK1 gene product bears similarities to that of PtdIns 3-kinases from mammals (p110) and yeast (Vps34p). Expression of PIK1 from a multicopy plasmid elevated PtdIns 4-kinase activity and enhanced the response to mating pheromone. A pik1 null mutant was inviable, indicating that PtdIns4P and presumably PtdIns[4,5]P2 are indispensable phospholipids.
The nuclear DNA-binding protein NF-E2 is thought to mediate the powerful erythroid enhancer activity of the alpha- and beta-globin locus control regions and participates in the control of genes encoding two enzymes of haem biosynthesis (porphobilinogen deaminase and ferrochelatase). The major component of NF-E2 is a 45K polypeptide (designated p45 NF-E2) that belongs to the basic region-leucine zipper family of transcription factors. This subunit of NF-E2 is specifically expressed in haematopoietic progenitor cells and differentiated cells of the erythroid, megakaryocyte and mast cell lineages. The gene encoding p45 NF-E2 (murine gene Nfe2) has been mapped to mouse chromosome 15 near the mutation microcytosis (mk). Homozygous mk mice have severe hypochromic microcytic anaemia as a result of decreased globin synthesis and defects in intestinal and erythroid iron absorption. Here we investigate whether the mk mutation lies within Nfe2 by characterizing the p45 NF-E2 gene and determining its DNA sequence in wild-type and mk alleles. The mk allele carries a missense mutation that causes substitution of valine by alanine at amino acid 173 of the p45 NF-E2 protein. Expression of p45 NF-E2 messenger RNA was detected in erythroid tissues of normal mice and in the duodenum of normal and severely anaemic beta-thalassaemic (Hbbd-th3/Hbbd-th3) mice. We propose that the mk mutation results in an impaired form of NF-E2 which fails to regulate both globin production and iron metabolism properly.
Initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotes requires recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the messenger RNA (mRNA). In most cases, this depends on recognition of a modified nucleotide cap on the 5' end of the mRNA. However, an alternate pathway uses a structured RNA element in the 5' untranslated region of the messenger or viral RNA called an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy map of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES bound to the 40S ribosomal subunit at about 20 A resolution. IRES binding induces a pronounced conformational change in the 40S subunit and closes the mRNA binding cleft, suggesting a mechanism for IRES-mediated positioning of mRNA in the ribosomal decoding center.
Esherichia coli microcin B17 is a posttranslationally modified peptide that inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase. It contains four oxazole and four thiazole rings and is representative of a broad class of pharmaceutically important natural products with five-membered heterocycles derived from peptide precursors. An in vitro assay was developed to detect heterocycle formation, and an enzyme complex, microcin B17 synthase, was purified and found to contain three proteins, McbB, McbC, and McbD, that convert 14 residues into the eight mono- and bisheterocyclic moieties in vitro that confer antibiotic activity on mature microcin B17. These enzymatic reactions alter the peptide backbone connectivity. The propeptide region of premicrocin is the major recognition determinant for binding and downstream heterocycle formation by microcin B17 synthase. A general pathway for the enzymatic biosynthesis of these heterocycles is formulated.
Arcelin, a major seed protein discovered in wild beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), has toxic effects on an important bean bruchid pest, Zabrotes subfasciatus. Transfer of the arcelin-1 allele to bean cultivars and addition of purified arcelin to artificial seeds results in high levels of insect resistance. The nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences of the arcelin-1 complementary DNA are very similar to those of genes encoding the bean seed lectin, phytohemagglutinin. The gene or genes encoding arcelin may have evolved from a phytohemagglutinin gene or genes resulting in an effective mechanism for resistance to bean bruchids.
Single-stranded RNA viruses encompass broad classes of infectious agents and cause the common cold, cancer, AIDS and other serious health threats. Viral replication is regulated at many levels, including the use of conserved genomic RNA structures. Most potential regulatory elements in viral RNA genomes are uncharacterized. Here we report the structure of an entire HIV-1 genome at single nucleotide resolution using SHAPE, a high-throughput RNA analysis technology. The genome encodes protein structure at two levels. In addition to the correspondence between RNA and protein primary sequences, a correlation exists between high levels of RNA structure and sequences that encode inter-domain loops in HIV proteins. This correlation suggests that RNA structure modulates ribosome elongation to promote native protein folding. Some simple genome elements previously shown to be important, including the ribosomal gag-pol frameshift stem-loop, are components of larger RNA motifs. We also identify organizational principles for unstructured RNA regions, including splice site acceptors and hypervariable regions. These results emphasize that the HIV-1 genome and, potentially, many coding RNAs are punctuated by previously unrecognized regulatory motifs and that extensive RNA structure constitutes an important component of the genetic code.
Administration of certain commonly used barbiturates containing allyl groups, such as secobarbital, allobarbital, or aprobarbital to rats treated chronically with a microsomal enzyme inducer causes a rapid destruction of the liver microsomal hemoprotein that serves as the terminal oxidase for drug metabolism. In contrast, barbiturates without an allyl group do not have this effect. The decrease in this hemoprotein, cytochrome P(450), by the barbiturates containing an allyl group could also be demonstrated in an in vitro liver microsomal system requiring reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. These results suggest that the barbiturates containing an allyl group are converted to a metabolite that leads to the destruction of cytochrome P(450).
Molecular networks guide the biochemistry of a living cell on multiple levels: Its metabolic and signaling pathways are shaped by the network of interacting proteins, whose production, in turn, is controlled by the genetic regulatory network. To address topological properties of these two networks, we quantified correlations between connectivities of interacting nodes and compared them to a null model of a network, in which all links were randomly rewired. We found that for both interaction and regulatory networks, links between highly connected proteins are systematically suppressed, whereas those between a highly connected and low-connected pairs of proteins are favored. This effect decreases the likelihood of cross talk between different functional modules of the cell and increases the overall robustness of a network by localizing effects of deleterious perturbations.
A single point mutation has been engineered in the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase that improves its affinity (KM) for its substrate ATP by a factor of 100. In the crystal structure of the tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (of Bacillus stearothermophilus), the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr 51 appears to make a weak hydrogen bond with the AMP moiety of the substrate intermediate, tyrosyl adenylate. In the absence of substrate, however, the hydroxyl group should make a strong hydrogen bond with water which would favour dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex. We have used oligodeoxynucleotide-directed mutagenesis to construct two point mutants at this site: one to remove the hydroxyl group (Thr 51 leads to Ala 51) and the other, in addition, to distort the local polypeptide backbone (Thr 51 leads to Pro 51). We report here that both mutants have increased activity (kcat/KM for ATP) but one mutant (Pro 51) shows a massive 25-fold increase due mainly to a lowered KM for ATP. This demonstrates dramatically the potential of in vitro mutagenesis for improving the affinity of an enzyme for its substrate.
Temperature-sensitive paralysis is the most striking defect of adult Drosophila carrying the shibire mutation. This is believed to be due to a reversible block of endocytosis, which prevents membrane cycling and thus depletes synaptic vesicles. The shibire mutation also affects many tissues outside the nervous system. We have now mapped and characterized the shibire gene. A 275-kilobase yeast artificial chromosome was subcloned into cosmids, among which the gene was then located by analysing with restriction-fragment length polymorphisms. A 15-kilobase fragment of wild-type DNA rescues the mutant phenotype and the sequence of two mutant alleles show differences with wild type, demonstrating that we have isolated the shibire gene. The gene encodes a protein that is highly similar to rat dynamin, 69% of the amino-acid sequence is identical. Dynamin is a GTP-driven mechanochemical enzyme related to mammalian mx-proteins and to the yeast vps 1 gene product. Because the shibire gene product and dynamin have extensive similarity, we propose that they are cognate homologues. Dynamin causes microtubules to slide along each other in vitro and in extracts it is associated with a distinct, but so far uncharacterized, membrane fraction. In light of the shibire phenotype, we suggest that these proteins provide the motor for vesicular transport during endocytosis.
The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) promotes the destruction of target proteins by attaching to them a ubiquitin chain that is recognized by the 26S proteasome. The UPS influences most cellular processes, and its targets include transcriptional activators that are primary determinants of gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that non-proteolytic functions of the UPS might stimulate transcriptional activity. Here we show that the proteolysis of some transcriptional activators by the UPS can stimulate their function. We focused on the role of UPS-dependent proteolysis in the function of inducible transcriptional activators in yeast, and found that inhibition of the proteasome reduced transcription of the targets of the activators Gcn4, Gal4 and Ino2/4. In addition, mutations in SCF(Cdc4), the ubiquitin ligase for Gcn4 (ref. 5), or mutations in ubiquitin that prevent degradation, also impaired the transcription of Gcn4 targets. These transcriptional defects were manifested despite the enhanced abundance of Gcn4 on cognate promoters. Proteasome inhibition also decreased the association of RNA polymerase II with Gcn4, Gal4 and Ino2/4 targets, as did mutations in SCF(Cdc4) for Gcn4 targets. Expression of a stable phospho-site mutant of Gcn4 (ref. 7) or disruption of the kinases that target Gcn4 for turnover alleviated the sensitivity of Gcn4 activity to defects in the UPS.
To study the nuclear organization and dynamics of nucleotide excision repair (NER), the endonuclease ERCC1/XPF (for excision repair cross complementation group 1/xeroderma pigmentosum group F) was tagged with green fluorescent protein and its mobility was monitored in living Chinese hamster ovary cells. In the absence of DNA damage, the complex moved freely through the nucleus, with a diffusion coefficient (15 +/- 5 square micrometers per second) consistent with its molecular size. Ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage caused a transient dose-dependent immobilization of ERCC1/XPF, likely due to engagement of the complex in a single repair event. After 4 minutes, the complex regained mobility. These results suggest (i) that NER operates by assembly of individual NER factors at sites of DNA damage rather than by preassembly of holocomplexes and (ii) that ERCC1/XPF participates in repair of DNA damage in a distributive fashion rather than by processive scanning of large genome segments.
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II purified from healthy plant tissue is capable of synthesizing linear (-)-viroid RNA copies of full length from (+)-viroid RNA templates in vitro. Together with the specific alpha-amanitin sensitivity of viroid replication observed in vivo, these findings suggest that viroids replicate by an entirely novel mechanism in which infecting viroid RNA molecules are copied by the host enzyme which is normally responsible for the synthesis of nuclear precursors to messenger RNA.
Photosystem II is a multisubunit enzyme complex involved in plant photosynthesis. It uses solar energy to catalyse the breakdown of water to reducing equivalents and molecular oxygen. Native photosystem II comprises more than 25 different subunits, and has a relative molecular mass of more than 600K. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of a photosystem II subcomplex, containing the proteins D1, D2, CP47 and cytochrome b-559, determined by electron crystallography. This CP47 reaction centre, which has a relative molecular mass of 160K, can perform light-mediated energy and electron-transfer reactions but is unable to oxidize water. The complex contains 23 transmembrane alpha-helices, of which 16 have been assigned to the D1, D2 and CP47 proteins. The arrangement of these helices is remarkably similar to that of the helices in the reaction centres of purple bacteria and of plant photosystem I, indicating a common evolutionary origin for these assemblies. The map suggests that redox cofactors in the D1-D2 complex are located in positions analogous to those in the bacterial reaction centre, but the distance between the chlorophylls corresponding to the bacterial 'special pair' is significantly larger.
Proteomics, the large-scale analysis of proteins, will contribute greatly to our understanding of gene function in the post-genomic era. Proteomics can be divided into three main areas: (1) protein micro-characterization for large-scale identification of proteins and their post-translational modifications; (2) 'differential display' proteomics for comparison of protein levels with potential application in a wide range of diseases; and (3) studies of protein-protein interactions using techniques such as mass spectrometry or the yeast two-hybrid system. Because it is often difficult to predict the function of a protein based on homology to other proteins or even their three-dimensional structure, determination of components of a protein complex or of a cellular structure is central in functional analysis. This aspect of proteomic studies is perhaps the area of greatest promise. After the revolution in molecular biology exemplified by the ease of cloning by DNA methods, proteomics will add to our understanding of the biochemistry of proteins, processes and pathways for years to come.
Although primary structural homology between bacterial serine proteases and those from the mammalian pancreas is slight, two-thirds of the residues in the bacterial enzyme SGPB as seen at 2.8-A resolution, adopt a similar polypeptide chain conformation to that of the chymotrypsin family. The three major regions of difference show how this family of proteolytic enzymes has developed from the more primitive bacterial to the relatively sophisticated pancreatic enzymes.
Group II self-splicing introns catalyze autoexcision from precursor RNA transcripts by a mechanism strikingly similar to that of the spliceosome, an RNA-protein assembly responsible for splicing together the protein-coding parts of most eukaryotic pre-mRNAs. Splicing in both cases initiates via nucleophilic attack at the 5' splice site by the 2' OH of a conserved intron adenosine residue, creating a branched (lariat) intermediate. Here, we describe the crystal structure at 3.0 A resolution of a 70-nucleotide RNA containing the catalytically essential domains 5 and 6 of the yeast ai5gamma group II self-splicing intron, revealing an unexpected two-nucleotide bulged structure around the branch-point adenosine in domain 6.
Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent intercellular signal in mammals that mediates key aspects of blood pressure, hormone release, nerve transmission and the immune response of higher organisms. Proteins homologous to full-length mammalian nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) are found in lower multicellular organisms. Recently, genome sequencing has shown that some bacteria contain genes coding for truncated NOS proteins; this is consistent with reports of NOS-like activities in bacterial extracts. Biological functions for bacterial NOSs are unknown, but have been presumed to be analogous to their role in mammals. Here we describe a gene in the plant pathogen Streptomyces turgidiscabies that encodes a NOS homologue, and we reveal its role in nitrating a dipeptide phytotoxin required for plant pathogenicity. High similarity between bacterial NOSs indicates a general function in biosynthetic nitration; thus, bacterial NOSs constitute a new class of enzymes. Here we show that the primary function of Streptomyces NOS is radically different from that of mammalian NOS. Surprisingly, mammalian NO signalling and bacterial biosynthetic nitration share an evolutionary origin.
Stimulation of certain receptor tyrosine kinases results in the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma), an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). This hydrolysis generates diacylglycerol and free inositol phosphate, which in turn activate protein kinase C and increase intracellular Ca2+, respectively. PLC gamma physically associates with activated receptor tyrosine kinases, suggesting that it is a substrate for direct phosphorylation by these kinases. Here we report that a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor with a single point mutation at residue 766 replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine fails to associate with PLC gamma in response to FGF. This mutant receptor also failed to mediate PtdIns hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization after FGF stimulation. However, the mutant receptor phosphorylated itself and several other cellular proteins, and it mediated mitogenesis in response to FGF. These findings show that a point mutation in the FGF receptor selectively eliminates activation of PLC gamma and that neither Ca2+ mobilization nor PtdIns hydrolysis are required for FGF-induced mitogenesis.
Gs and Gi are guanine nucleotide-binding, heterotrimer proteins that regulate the activity of adenylate cyclase, and are responsible for transferring stimulatory and inhibitory hormonal signals, respectively, from cell surface receptors to the enzyme catalytic unit. These proteins can be directly activated by agents such as GTP and analogues, fluoride and magnesium. Decreased amounts of Gs and Gi, and even the absence of Gs, have been described, whereas an altered Gs has been reported in a cultured cell line (UNC variant of S49 lymphoma cells), but has never been observed in human disease states. We have found a profoundly altered Gs protein in a group of human growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas, characterized by high secretory activity and intracellular cyclic AMP levels. In the membranes from these tumours no stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by growth hormone-releasing hormone, by GTP or by fluoride was observed. Indeed, the last two agents caused an inhibition, probably mediated by Gi. In contrast, adenylate cyclase stimulation by Mg2+ was enormously increased. This altered pattern of adenylate cyclase regulation was reproduced when a cholate extract of the tumour membranes (which contains G proteins) was reconstituted with Gs-free, cyc- S49 cell membranes. Inasmuch as secretion from somatotrophic cells is known to be a cAMP-dependent function, the alteration of Gs could be the direct cause of the high secretory activity of the tumours in which it occurs.
FokI is a member of an unusual class of bipartite restriction enzymes that recognize a specific DNA sequence and cleave DNA nonspecifically a short distance away from that sequence. Because of its unusual bipartite nature, FokI has been used to create artificial enzymes with new specificities. We have determined the crystal structure at 2.8A resolution of the complete FokI enzyme bound to DNA. As anticipated, the enzyme contains amino- and carboxy-terminal domains corresponding to the DNA-recognition and cleavage functions, respectively. The recognition domain is made of three smaller subdomains (D1, D2 and D3) which are evolutionarily related to the helix-turn-helix-containing DNA-binding domain of the catabolite gene activator protein CAP. The CAP core has been extensively embellished in the first two subdomains, whereas in the third subdomain it has been co-opted for protein-protein interactions. Surprisingly, the cleavage domain contains only a single catalytic centre, raising the question of how monomeric FokI manages to cleave both DNA strands. Unexpectedly, the cleavage domain is sequestered in a 'piggyback' fashion by the recognition domain. The structure suggests a new mechanism for nuclease activation and provides a framework for the design of chimaeric enzymes with altered specificities.
Aldehyde and ketone xenobiotic substances are preferentially reduced to alcohols by cytoplasmic enzymes in mammals. These enzymes are widely distributed in the tissues, have broad substrate specificities, have similar physical-chemical characteristics, and require reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as cofactor for the reductions. These reductases define a system of detoxification for aldehyde and ketone groups.
Comparative sequence analysis of genomic and complementary DNA clones from several mitochondrial genes in the higher plant Oenothera revealed nucleotide sequence divergences between the genomic and the messenger RNA-derived sequences. These sequence alterations could be most easily explained by specific post-transcriptional nucleotide modifications. Most of the nucleotide exchanges in coding regions lead to altered codons in the mRNA that specify amino acids better conserved in evolution than those encoded by the genomic DNA. Several instances show that the genomic arginine codon CGG is edited in the mRNA to the tryptophan codon TGG in amino acid positions that are highly conserved as tryptophan in the homologous proteins of other species. This editing suggests that the standard genetic code is used in plant mitochondria and resolves the frequent coincidence of CGG codons and tryptophan in different plant species. The apparently frequent and non-species-specific equivalency of CGG and TGG codons in particular suggests that RNA editing is a common feature of all higher plant mitochondria.
Aging is genetically determined and environmentally modulated. In a study of longevity in the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we found that five independent P-element insertional mutations in a single gene resulted in a near doubling of the average adult life-span without a decline in fertility or physical activity. Sequence analysis revealed that the product of this gene, named Indy (for I'm not dead yet), is most closely related to a mammalian sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter-a membrane protein that transports Krebs cycle intermediates. Indy was most abundantly expressed in the fat body, midgut, and oenocytes: the principal sites of intermediary metabolism in the fly. Excision of the P element resulted in a reversion to normal life-span. These mutations may create a metabolic state that mimics caloric restriction, which has been shown to extend life-span.
Mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis has a key role in the regulation of aerobic metabolism and cell survival, but the molecular identity of the Ca(2+) channel, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, is still unknown. Here we have identified in silico a protein (named MCU) that shares tissue distribution with MICU1 (also known as CBARA1), a recently characterized uniporter regulator, is present in organisms in which mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake was demonstrated and whose sequence includes two transmembrane domains. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of MCU in HeLa cells markedly reduced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake. MCU overexpression doubled the matrix Ca(2+) concentration increase evoked by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonists, thus significantly buffering the cytosolic elevation. The purified MCU protein showed channel activity in planar lipid bilayers, with electrophysiological properties and inhibitor sensitivity of the uniporter. A mutant MCU, in which two negatively charged residues of the putative pore-forming region were replaced, had no channel activity and reduced agonist-dependent matrix Ca(2+) concentration transients when overexpressed in HeLa cells. Overall, these data demonstrate that the 40-kDa protein identified is the channel responsible for ruthenium-red-sensitive mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, thus providing a molecular basis for this process of utmost physiological and pathological relevance.
AtT-20 cells, a mouse pituitary line, externalize a viral membrane glycoprotein and the precursor of ACTH constitutively, that is, rapidly without storage or regulation. They also have a regulated pathway in which they cleave the precursor to mature hormones, ACTH and beta-endorphin, store them in secretory granules and discharge them only in the presence of a secretagogue. An analogy exists for newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes which are either delivered to the lysosome or secreted from the cell. Targeting to the lysosomes may require a low pH step, since chloroquine causes the enzymes to be secreted from the cell. Here we show that chloroquine (200 microM) also appears to block the storage of newly synthesized ACTH in secretory granules and instead diverts it to the outside of the cell via the constitutive pathway. Chloroquine has no effect on the constitutive pathway and does not block the exocytosis of pre-packaged ACTH. Thus like lysosomal enzymes, peptide hormones are not sent to their correct destinations in the presence of chloroquine, but are diverted instead to a constitutive pathway that is chloroquine-insensitive.
Dopa has been identified in rat food by three different fluorimetric assays and paper chromatography. Incubation of the rat food with proteolytic enzymes dramatically increased the measurable free dopa. Analysis of samples of six individual protein-containing constituents of rat food revealed that both wheat and oats contain dopa.
Asthma is a common respiratory disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of coughing, wheezing and breathlessness. Although environmental factors such as allergen exposure are risk factors in the development of asthma, both twin and family studies point to a strong genetic component. To date, linkage studies have identified more than a dozen genomic regions linked to asthma. In this study, we performed a genome-wide scan on 460 Caucasian families and identified a locus on chromosome 20p13 that was linked to asthma (log(10) of the likelihood ratio (LOD), 2.94) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (LOD, 3.93). A survey of 135 polymorphisms in 23 genes identified the ADAM33 gene as being significantly associated with asthma using case-control, transmission disequilibrium and haplotype analyses (P = 0.04 0.000003). ADAM proteins are membrane-anchored metalloproteases with diverse functions, which include the shedding of cell-surface proteins such as cytokines and cytokine receptors. The identification and characterization of ADAM33, a putative asthma susceptibility gene identified by positional cloning in an outbred population, should provide insights into the pathogenesis and natural history of this common disease.
HIV-1 protease processes the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins into mature structural and functional proteins, including itself, and is therefore indispensable for viral maturation. The mature protease is active only as a dimer with each subunit contributing catalytic residues. The full-length transframe region protease precursor appears to be monomeric yet undergoes maturation via intramolecular cleavage of a putative precursor dimer, concomitant with the appearance of mature-like catalytic activity. How such intramolecular cleavage can occur when the amino and carboxy termini of the mature protease are part of an intersubunit beta-sheet located distal from the active site is unclear. Here we visualize the early events in N-terminal autoprocessing using an inactive mini-precursor with a four-residue N-terminal extension that mimics the transframe region protease precursor. Using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, a technique that is exquisitely sensitive to the presence of minor species, we show that the mini-precursor forms highly transient, lowly populated (3-5%) dimeric encounter complexes that involve the mature dimer interface but occupy a wide range of subunit orientations relative to the mature dimer. Furthermore, the occupancy of the mature dimer configuration constitutes a very small fraction of the self-associated species (accounting for the very low enzymatic activity of the protease precursor), and the N-terminal extension makes transient intra- and intersubunit contacts with the substrate binding site and is therefore available for autocleavage when the correct dimer orientation is sampled within the encounter complex ensemble.
The 3' ends of most eukaryotic messenger RNAs are generated by internal cleavage and polyadenylation. In mammals, there is a strict dependence of both reactions on the sequence AAUAAA, which occurs upstream of polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites and which is recognized by CPSF. In contrast, cis-acting signals for yeast 3'-end generation are highly divergent from those of mammals, suggesting that trans-acting factors other than poly(A) polymerase would not be conserved. The essential yeast protein Brr5/Ysh1 shows sequence similarity to subunits of mammalian CPSF and is required for 3'-end processing in vivo and in vitro. These results demonstrate a structural and functional conservation of the yeast and mammalian 3'-end processing machineries despite a lack of conservation of the cis sequences.
Intracellular signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases in mammalian cells results in activation of a signal cascade that includes the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras and the protein kinases Raf, MEK [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase], and MAPK. MAPK activation that is dependent on the coupling of Ras and Raf was reconstituted in yeast. Yeast genes were isolated that, when overexpressed, enhanced the function of Raf. One of them is identical to BMH1, which encodes a protein similar to members of the mammalian 14-3-3 family. Bacterially synthesized mammalian 14-3-3 protein stimulated the activity of Raf prepared from yeast cells expressing c-Raf-1. Thus, the 14-3-3 protein may participate in or be required for activation of Raf.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that regulate the stability or the translational efficiency of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The latency-associated transcript (LAT) of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is the only viral gene expressed during latent infection in neurons. LAT inhibits apoptosis and maintains latency by promoting the survival of infected neurons. No protein product has been attributed to the LAT gene and the mechanism by which LAT protects cells from apoptosis is not yet known. Here we show that a miRNA encoded by the HSV-1 LAT gene confers resistance to apoptosis. Neuroblastoma cells transfected with a fragment of the LAT gene show reduced susceptibility to cell death. The anti-apoptotic function of LAT has been mapped to a region within the first exon. We have identified and characterized a microRNA (miR-LAT) generated from the exon 1 region of the HSV-1 LAT gene. The LAT miRNA was found to accumulate in cells transiently transfected with the LAT gene fragment or infected with a wild-type strain of HSV-1. A mutant virus in which a 372-nucleotide fragment encompassing the mature miRNA was deleted neither protected the infected cells from apoptosis nor generated an miRNA. miR-LAT exerts its anti-apoptotic effect by downregulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and SMAD3 expression, both of which are functionally linked in the TGF-beta pathway. Our results suggest that the miRNA encoded by the HSV-1 LAT gene regulates the induction of apoptosis in infected cells by modulation of TGF-beta signalling and thus contributes to the persistence of HSV in a latent form in sensory neurons.
Prefoldins (PFDs) are members of a recently identified, small-molecular weight protein family able to assemble into molecular chaperone complexes. Here we describe an unusually large member of this family, termed URI, that forms complexes with other small-molecular weight PFDs and with RPB5, a shared subunit of all three RNA polymerases. Functional analysis of the yeast and human orthologs of URI revealed that both are targets of nutrient signaling and participate in gene expression controlled by the TOR kinase. Thus, URI is a component of a signaling pathway that coordinates nutrient availability with gene expression.
One of the important regulatory concepts to emerge from studies of eukaryotic gene expression is that RNA polymerase II promoters and their upstream activators are composed of functional modules whose synergistic action regulates the transcriptional activity of a nearby gene. Biochemical analysis of synergy by ZEBRA, a non-acidic activator of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle, showed that the synergistic transcriptional effect of promoter sites and activation modules correlates with assembly of the TFIID:TFIIA (DA) complex in DNase I footprinting and gel shift assays. The activator-dependent DA complex differs from a basal DA complex by its ability to bind TFIIB stably in an interaction regulated by TATA-binding protein-associated factors (TAFs). TFIIB enhances the degree of synergism by increasing complex stability. Similar findings were made with the acidic activator GAL4-VP16. Our data suggest a unifying mechanism for gene activation and synergy by acidic and non-acidic activators, and indicate that synergy is manifested at the earliest stage of preinitiation complex assembly.
The active hormonal form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3[1,25(OH), which regulates cellular replication and function in many tissues and has a role in bone and calcium homeostasis, acts through a hormone receptor homologous with other steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. A 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive element (VDRE), which is within the promoter for osteocalcin [a bone protein induced by 1,25(OH)2D3] is unresponsive to other steroid hormones, can function in a heterologous promoter, and contains a doubly palindromic DNA sequence (TTGGTGACTCACCGGGTGAAC; -513 to -493 bp), with nucleotide sequence homology to other hormone responsive elements. The potent glucocorticoid repression of 1,25(OH)2D3 induction and of basal activity of this promoter acts through a region between -196 and +34 bp, distinct from the VDRE.
The structure and function of transcription factors of higher plants was studied by isolating cDNA clones encoding a wheat sequence-specific DNA binding protein. A hexameric nucleotide motif, ACGTCA, is located upstream from the TATA box of several plant histone genes. It has been suggested that this motif is essential for efficient transcription of the wheat histone H3 gene. A wheat nuclear protein, HBP-1 (histone DNA binding protein-1), which specifically binds to the hexameric motif, has previously been identified as a putative transcription factor. A cDNA clone encoding HBP-1 has been isolated on the basis of specific binding of HBP-1 to the hexameric motif. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that HBP-1 contains the leucine zipper motif, which represents a characteristic property of several eukaryotic transcription factors.
The ubiquitous Ca(2+)-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) is a key protein in Ca2+ homeostasis and activation of eukaryotic cells. CaM is the molecular link between free Ca2+ in the cell and the inhibition, or activation, of numerous enzymes. Many nuclear functions are under Ca2+/CaM control, and some transcriptional activators are known to be Ca2+ modulated indirectly through Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases. But Ca2+/CaM has not yet been found to directly modulate any transcription factor or other DNA-binding protein. Transcription factors of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) group are important regulators in numerous systems. Here we report that binding of Ca(2+)-loaded CaM to the bHLH domains of several bHLH proteins directly inhibits their DNA binding. Other bHLH proteins are either less sensitive or resistant. Ca2+ ionophore selectively inhibits transcriptional activation by Ca2+/CaM-sensitive bHLH proteins in vivo, implying that Ca2+ can directly influence transcription through differential CaM inhibition of bHLH domains.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are bone-derived factors capable of inducing ectopic bone formation. Unlike other BMPs, BMP-1 is not like transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), but it is the prototype of a family of putative proteases implicated in pattern formation during development in diverse organisms. Although some members of this group, such as Drosophila tolloid (TLD), are postulated to activate TGF-beta-like proteins, actual substrates are unknown. Procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) cleaves the COOH-propeptides of procollagens I, II, and III to yield the major fibrous components of vertebrate extracellular matrix. Here it is shown that BMP-1 and PCP are identical. This demonstration of enzymatic activity for a BMP-1/TLD-like protein links an enzyme involved in matrix deposition to genes involved in pattern formation.
A mutant catalytic subunit of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase has been isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is no longer subject to regulation yet retains its catalytic activity. Biochemical analysis of the mutant subunit indicates a 100-fold decreased affinity for the regulatory subunit. The mutant catalytic subunit exhibits approximately a threefold increase in Michaelis constant for adenosine triphosphate and peptide cosubstrates, and is essentially unchanged in its catalytic rate. The nucleotide sequence of the mutant gene contains a single nucleotide change resulting in a threonine-to-alanine substitution at amino acid 241. This residue is conserved in other serine-threonine protein kinases. These results identify this threonine as an important contact between catalytic and regulatory subunits but only a minor contact in substrate recognition.
Substantial evidence suggests that calcium has a pivotal role in regulating the initial events through which insulin alters plasma membrane metabolism. Because binding of insulin to its receptor represents the initial site of insulin action in the plasma membrane, studies were undertaken to determine whether the insulin receptor is a calmodulin-binding protein. Preparations enriched in the insulin receptor and calmodulin-binding proteins were isolated from detergent-solubilized rat adipocyte membranes by chromatography with wheat germ agglutinin agarose and calmodulin-conjugated Sepharose, respectively. Substantial purification of a manganese-dependent, insulin-sensitive phosphoprotein of 95K identified as the beta subunit of the insulin receptor was accomplished. Binding and photocovalent cross-linking of iodine-125-labeled calmodulin to these affinity-purified preparations and to isolated plasma membranes, followed by immunoadsorption with insulin receptor antibodies bound to protein A Sepharose, resulted in significant purification of a binding complex of 110K to 140K. These results indicate that the adipocyte insulin receptor or a polypeptide closely associated with the receptor is a calmodulin-binding protein.
Protein tyrosine phosphatases regulate signal transduction pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation and have been implicated in the development of cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension. Increasing evidence suggests that the cellular redox state is involved in regulating tyrosine phosphatase activity through the reversible oxidization of the catalytic cysteine to sulphenic acid (Cys-SOH). But how further oxidation to the irreversible sulphinic (Cys-SO2H) and sulphonic (Cys-SO3H) forms is prevented remains unclear. Here we report the crystal structures of the regulatory sulphenic and irreversible sulphinic and sulphonic acids of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), an important enzyme in the negative regulation of the insulin receptor and a therapeutic target in type II diabetes and obesity. We also identify a sulphenyl-amide species that is formed through oxidation of its catalytic cysteine. Formation of the sulphenyl-amide causes large changes in the PTP1B active site, which are reversible by reduction with the cellular reducing agent glutathione. The sulphenyl-amide is a protective intermediate in the oxidative inhibition of PTP1B. In addition, it may facilitate reactivation of PTP1B by biological thiols and signal a unique state of the protein.
Small DNA lesions such as oxidized or alkylated bases are repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. BER includes removal of the damaged base by a lesion-specific DNA glycosylase, strand scission by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, DNA resynthesis and ligation. BER may be further subdivided into DNA beta-polymerase (beta-pol)-dependent single-nucleotide repair and beta-pol-dependent or -independent long patch repair subpathways. Two important enzymatic steps in mammalian single-nucleotide BER are contributed by beta-pol: DNA resynthesis of the repair patch and lyase removal of 5'-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP). Fibroblasts from beta-pol null mice are hypersensitive to mono-functional DNA-methylating agents, resulting in increases in chromosomal damage, apoptosis and necrotic cell death. Here we show that only the dRP lyase activity of beta-pol is required to reverse methylating agent hypersensitivity in beta-pol null cells. These results indicate that removal of the dRP group is a pivotal step in BER in vivo. Persistence of the dRP moiety in DNA results in the hypersensitivity phenotype of beta-pol null cells and may signal downstream events such as apoptosis and necrotic cell death.
There are three distinct enolase isoenzymes in brain; neuron-specific enolase (NSE), formerly referred to as neuron-specific protein, which is specifically localized in neurons, a nonneuronal enolase (NNE), and a third hybrid form. Light microscopy with immunocytochemical techniques has permitted localization of non-neuronal enolase. The NNE is located in glial cells with no staining of endothelial cells or neurons. Thus, NSE and NNE can be used as specific metabolic markers for neurons and glial cells, respectively.
Gene A protein, the initiator protein of bacteriophage phi X174 DNA replication, cleaves synthetic single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides at the same site as the corresponding sequence at the phi X origin. The results identify the recognition sequence within the decamer CAACTTGATA which is cleaved next to the G residue. Further requirements for cleavage of double-stranded DNA by the gene A protein are supercoiling and an A + T-rich domain adjacent to the recognition sequence.
In bacteria, promoter recognition depends on the RNA polymerase sigma subunit, which combines with the catalytically proficient RNA polymerase core to form the holoenzyme. The major class of bacterial promoters is defined by two conserved elements (the -10 and -35 elements, which are 10 and 35 nucleotides upstream of the initiation point, respectively) that are contacted by sigma in the holoenzyme. We show that recognition of promoters of this class depends on the "flexible flap" domain of the RNA polymerase beta subunit. The flap interacts with conserved region 4 of sigma and triggers a conformational change that moves region 4 into the correct position for interaction with the -35 element. Because the flexible flap is evolutionarily conserved, this domain may facilitate promoter recognition by specificity factors in eukaryotes as well.
Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system are the predominant cell producing HIV-1 in most tissues including the central nervous system (CNS), spinal cord, lung and skin; infection is associated with dementia, neuropathy, pneumonitis, and dermatitis respectively. Different HIV-1 isolates vary markedly in their ability to infect mononuclear phagocytes productively. Here we describe molecular clones of a CNS-derived isolate, HIV-1(JR-FL), which can replicate efficiently in mononuclear phagocytes. Analysis by polymerase chain reaction of early events after infection indicates that the early phase of viral replication before reverse transcription determines tropism. Genetic mapping of the macrophage-tropic phenotype by construction of recombinant viruses indicates that mononuclear phagocyte infectivity can be determined by a 157-amino-acid region of the gp 120 glycoprotein of HIV-1(JR-FL). Significantly, this region is upstream from the previously defined CD4-binding domain. We propose that at least one determinant for mononuclear phagocyte tropism involves target cell interactions with regions of gp120 distinct from the CD4-binding domain.
Methylation of lysine and arginine residues on histone tails affects chromatin structure and gene transcription. Tri- and dimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3/me2) is required for the binding of the repressive protein HP1 and is associated with heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression in a variety of species. H3K9me3 has long been regarded as a 'permanent' epigenetic mark. In a search for proteins and complexes interacting with H3K9me3, we identified the protein GASC1 (gene amplified in squamous cell carcinoma 1), which belongs to the JMJD2 (jumonji domain containing 2) subfamily of the jumonji family, and is also known as JMJD2C. Here we show that three members of this subfamily of proteins demethylate H3K9me3/me2 in vitro through a hydroxylation reaction requiring iron and alpha-ketoglutarate as cofactors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of GASC1 or other JMJD2 members markedly decreases H3K9me3/me2 levels, increases H3K9me1 levels, delocalizes HP1 and reduces heterochromatin in vivo. Previously, GASC1 was found to be amplified in several cell lines derived from oesophageal squamous carcinomas, and in agreement with a contribution of GASC1 to tumour development, inhibition of GASC1 expression decreases cell proliferation. Thus, in addition to identifying GASC1 as a histone trimethyl demethylase, we suggest a model for how this enzyme might be involved in cancer development, and propose it as a target for anti-cancer therapy.
The removal of introns from messenger RNA precursors requires five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), contained within ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), which complex with the pre-mRNA and other associated factors to form the spliceosome. In both yeast and mammals, the U2 snRNA base pairs with sequences surrounding the site of lariat formation. Binding of U2 snRNP to the highly degenerate branchpoint sequence in mammalian introns is absolutely dependent on an auxiliary protein, U2AF, which recognizes a polypyrimidine stretch adjacent to the 3' splice site. The absence of this sequence motif in yeast introns has strengthened arguments that the two systems are fundamentally different. Deletion analyses of the yeast U2 gene have confirmed that the highly conserved 5' domain is essential, although the adjacent approximately 950 nucleotides can be deleted without any phenotypic consequence. A 3'-terminal domain of approximately 100 nucleotides is also required for wild-type growth rates; the highly conserved terminal loop within this domain (loop IV) may provide specific binding contacts for two U2-specific snRNP proteins. We have replaced the single copy yeast U2 (yU2) gene with human U2 (hU2), expecting that weak or no complementation would provide an assay for cloning additional splicing factors, such as U2AF. We report here that hU2 can complement the yeast deletion with surprising efficiency. The interactions governing spliceosome assembly and intron recognition are thus more conserved than previously suspected. Paradoxically, the conserved loop IV sequence is dispensable in yeast.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are important for DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination, and mutations in these genes predispose to breast and other cancers. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme involved in base excision repair, a key pathway in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks. We show here that BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. This seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination. These results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair damage, and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic therapies for cancer.
Protein kinase C, an enzyme that is activated by the receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, relays information in the form of a variety of extracellular signals across the membrane to regulate many Ca2+-dependent processes. At an early phase of cellular responses, the enzyme appears to have a dual effect, providing positive forward as well as negative feedback controls over various steps of its own and other signaling pathways, such as the receptors that are coupled to inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and those of some growth factors. In biological systems, a positive signal is frequently followed by immediate negative feedback regulation. Such a novel role of this protein kinase system seems to give a logical basis for clarifying the biochemical mechanism of signal transduction, and to add a new dimension essential to our understanding of cell-to-cell communication.
Labeled acetylcholine derived from labeled pyruvate in a synaptosomal preparation from rat brain, incubated with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as well as coenzyme A, is stimulated by calcium ions in the absence but not in the presence of Triton X-100. Whereas citrate is taken up by cholinergic synaptosomes because it suppresses the formation of acetylcholine from pyruvate, it is not itself converted into acetylcholine. The evidence suggests that there is a calcium-dependent transfer of mitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A into the cholinergic synaptoplasm, which is apparently devoid of the citrate cleavage enzyme, and is there converted into acetylcholine. The permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to coenzyme A and acetyl coenzyme A seems to be enhanced by calcium ions, and this effect may be mediated by mitochondrial phospholipase A2.
During a herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) lytic infection, three classes of viral genes are transcribed in a temporally regulated manner. The HSV-1 'immediate-early' (IE) promoter sequences contain multiple copies of a hexanucleotide sequence, GGGCGG, known as a GC box, and one or more copies of an 11-base pair (bp) conserved A + T-rich element, designated TAATGARAT. The TAATGARAT elements are thought to mediate the trans-activation of IE RNA synthesis by a virion-associated protein(s), and the flanking G + C-rich sequences appear both to potentiate this induction and to direct IE promoter activity in vivo. The similarity of the herpesvirus GC box repeats to those of the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter prompted the in vitro analysis of HSV IE transcription reported here. We show that the mammalian gene-specific transcription factor Sp1 binds to eight distinct regions of the HSV short terminal repeat and stimulates transcription 25-fold from the divergent IE-3 (ICP-4) and IE-4/5 promoters.
Many receptors, in response to ligand activation, trigger inositol phospholipid breakdown, which leads to rapid intracellular responses. The sustained activation of this pathway is believed to be at least one of the factors involved in the stimulation of cell growth and there has been much speculation that certain oncogenes use this pathway to effect uncontrolled cellular proliferation. It has been suggested, by analogy with the receptor-mediated control of adenylate cyclase, that the receptor stimulation of inositol phospholipid metabolism is mediated through a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (G-protein) called Gp (or Np). Although such a species has not been identified, there is now strong experimental evidence that this process is mediated by a G-protein distinct from the stimulatory and inhibitory G-proteins (Gs and Gi, respectively). The ras genes code for a plasma membrane protein, p21, whose only known biochemical property is a high-affinity GTPase activity. We show here that the expression of normal p21N-ras in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts leads to the coupling of certain growth factor receptors to stimulated inositol phosphate production. We propose that the N-ras proto-oncogene encodes a protein which couples the receptors for certain growth factors to the stimulation of phospholipase C. Thus, N-ras p21 may be the putative Gp or a functionally related protein.
In obesity and type 2 diabetes, expression of the GLUT4 glucose transporter is decreased selectively in adipocytes. Adipose-specific Glut4 (also known as Slc2a4) knockout (adipose-Glut4(-/-)) mice show insulin resistance secondarily in muscle and liver. Here we show, using DNA arrays, that expression of retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4) is elevated in adipose tissue of adipose-Glut4(-/-) mice. We show that serum RBP4 levels are elevated in insulin-resistant mice and humans with obesity and type 2 diabetes. RBP4 levels are normalized by rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing drug. Transgenic overexpression of human RBP4 or injection of recombinant RBP4 in normal mice causes insulin resistance. Conversely, genetic deletion of Rbp4 enhances insulin sensitivity. Fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid that increases urinary excretion of RBP4, normalizes serum RBP4 levels and improves insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet. Increasing serum RBP4 induces hepatic expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and impairs insulin signalling in muscle. Thus, RBP4 is an adipocyte-derived 'signal' that may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Lowering RBP4 could be a new strategy for treating type 2 diabetes.
Associations between proteins present on neurotransmitter-containing vesicles and on the presynaptic membrane are thought to underlie docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, which are obligate steps in regulated neurotransmission. SNAP-25 resides on the plasma membrane and interacts with syntaxin (a plasma membrane t-SNARE) and VAMP (a vesicle v-SNARE) to form a core protein complex thought to be an intermediate in a biochemical pathway that is essential for vesicular transport. We have now characterized a protein, Hrs-2, that interacts with SNAP-25. The binding of Hrs-2 to SNAP-25 is inhibited by calcium in the physiological concentration range that supports synaptic transmission. Furthermore, Hrs-2 binds and hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates with kinetics that suggest that ATP is the physiological substrate for this enzyme. Hrs-2 is expressed throughout the brain and is present in nerve terminals. Moreover, recombinant Hrs-2 inhibits calcium-triggered 3H-noradrenaline release from permeabilized PC12 cells. Our results suggest a role for Hrs-2 in regulating secretory processes through calcium- and nucleotide-dependent modulation of vesicle-trafficking protein complexes.
Assembly of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules involves the interaction of two distinct polypeptides (the heavy and light chains) with peptide antigen. Cell lines synthesizing both chains but expressing low levels of MHC class I molecules on their surface as a result of a failure in assembly and transport have been identified. We now report that although the apparent steady-state distribution in these cells of class I molecules is in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the molecules in fact are recycled between the ER and Golgi, rather than retained in the ER. This explains the failure of class I molecules to negotiate the secretory pathway. Class I molecules do not seem to be modified by Golgi enzymes, suggesting that the proteins do not reach the Golgi apparatus during recycling. But morphological and subcellular fractionation evidence indicates that they pass through the cis Golgi or a Golgi-associated organelle, which we postulate to be the recycling organelle. This compartment, which we call the 'cis-Golgi network', would thereby be a sorting organelle that selects proteins for return to the ER.
Aptamers are double-stranded DNA or single-stranded RNA molecules that bind specific molecular targets. Large randomly generated populations can be enriched in aptamers by in vitro selection and polymerase chain reaction. But so far single-stranded DNA has not been investigated for aptamer properties, nor has a target protein been considered that does not interact physiologically with nucleic acid. Here we describe the isolation of single-stranded DNA aptamers to the protease thrombin of the blood coagulation cascade and report binding affinities in the range 25-200 nM. Sequence data from 32 thrombin aptamers, selected from a pool of DNA containing 60 nucleotides of random sequence, displayed a highly conserved 14-17-base region. Several of these aptamers at nanomolar concentrations inhibited thrombin-catalysed fibrin-clot formation in vitro using either purified fibrinogen or human plasma.
Dynamins form a superfamily of large mechano-chemical GTPases that includes the classical dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (DLPs). They are found throughout the Eukarya, functioning in core cellular processes such as endocytosis and organelle division. Many bacteria are predicted by sequence to possess large GTPases with the same multidomain architecture that is found in DLPs. Mechanistic dissection of dynamin family members has been impeded by a lack of high-resolution structural data currently restricted to the GTPase and pleckstrin homology domains, and the dynamin-related human guanylate-binding protein. Here we present the crystal structure of a cyanobacterial DLP in both nucleotide-free and GDP-associated conformation. The bacterial DLP shows dynamin-like qualities, such as helical self-assembly and tubulation of a lipid bilayer. In vivo, it localizes to the membrane in a manner reminiscent of FZL, a chloroplast-specific dynamin-related protein with which it shares sequence similarity. Our results provide structural and mechanistic insight that may be relevant across the dynamin superfamily. Concurrently, we show compelling similarity between a cyanobacterial and chloroplast DLP that, given the endosymbiotic ancestry of chloroplasts, questions the evolutionary origins of dynamins.
RNA silencing is a conserved regulatory mechanism in fungi, plants and animals that regulates gene expression and defence against viruses and transgenes. Small silencing RNAs of approximately 20-30 nucleotides and their associated effector proteins, the Argonaute family proteins, are the central components in RNA silencing. A subset of small RNAs, such as microRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants, Piwi-interacting RNAs in animals and siRNAs in Drosophila, requires an additional crucial step for their maturation; that is, 2'-O-methylation on the 3' terminal nucleotide. A conserved S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferase, HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1), and its homologues are responsible for this specific modification. Here we report the 3.1 A crystal structure of full-length HEN1 from Arabidopsis in complex with a 22-nucleotide small RNA duplex and cofactor product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine. Highly cooperative recognition of the small RNA substrate by multiple RNA binding domains and the methyltransferase domain in HEN1 measures the length of the RNA duplex and determines the substrate specificity. Metal ion coordination by both 2' and 3' hydroxyls on the 3'-terminal nucleotide and four invariant residues in the active site of the methyltransferase domain suggests a novel Mg(2+)-dependent 2'-O-methylation mechanism.
Escherichia coli RecBCD is a heterotrimeric helicase/nuclease that catalyses a complex reaction in which double-strand breaks in DNA are processed for repair by homologous recombination. For some time it has been clear that the RecB subunit possesses a 3' --> 5' DNA helicase activity, which was thought to drive DNA translocation and unwinding in the RecBCD holoenzyme. Here we show that purified RecD protein is also a DNA helicase, but one that possesses a 5' --> 3' polarity. We also show that the RecB and RecD helicases are both active in intact RecBCD, because the enzyme remains capable of processive DNA unwinding when either of these subunits is inactivated by mutation. These findings point to a bipolar translocation model for RecBCD in which the two DNA helicases are complementary, travelling with opposite polarities, but in the same direction, on each strand of the antiparallel DNA duplex. This bipolar motor organization helps to explain various biochemical properties of RecBCD, notably its exceptionally high speed and processivity, and offers a mechanistic insight into aspects of RecBCD function.
A variety of cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, and chromosome condensation, require enzymes that can regulate the ensuing topological changes occurring in DNA. Such enzymes-DNA topoisomerases-alter DNA topology by catalysing the cleavage of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), the passage of DNA through the resulting break, and the rejoining of the broken phosphodiester backbone. DNA topoisomerase III from Escherichia coli belongs to the type IA family of DNA topoisomerases, which transiently cleave ssDNA via formation of a covalent 5' phosphotyrosine intermediate. Here we report the crystal structure, at 2.05 A resolution, of an inactive mutant of E. coli DNA topoisomerase III in a non-covalent complex with an 8-base ssDNA molecule. The enzyme undergoes a conformational change that allows the oligonucleotide to bind within a groove leading to the active site. We note that the ssDNA molecule adopts a conformation like that of B-DNA while bound to the enzyme. The position of the DNA within the realigned active site provides insight into the role of several highly conserved residues during catalysis. These findings confirm various aspects of the type IA topoisomerase mechanism while suggesting functional implications for other topoisomerases and proteins that perform DNA rearrangements.
Host- and pathogen-associated cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA triggers the activation of a NALP3 (also known as cryopyrin and NLRP3)-independent inflammasome, which activates caspase-1 leading to maturation of pro-interleukin-1beta and inflammation. The nature of the cytoplasmic-DNA-sensing inflammasome is currently unknown. Here we show that AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2), an interferon-inducible HIN-200 family member that contains an amino-terminal pyrin domain and a carboxy-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain, senses cytoplasmic DNA by means of its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain and interacts with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) through its pyrin domain to activate caspase-1. The interaction of AIM2 with ASC also leads to the formation of the ASC pyroptosome, which induces pyroptotic cell death in cells containing caspase-1. Knockdown of AIM2 by short interfering RNA reduced inflammasome/pyroptosome activation by cytoplasmic DNA in human and mouse macrophages, whereas stable expression of AIM2 in the non-responsive human embryonic kidney 293T cell line conferred responsiveness to cytoplasmic DNA. Our results show that cytoplasmic DNA triggers formation of the AIM2 inflammasome by inducing AIM2 oligomerization. This study identifies AIM2 as an important inflammasome component that senses potentially dangerous cytoplasmic DNA, leading to activation of the ASC pyroptosome and caspase-1.
Steroid response and stress-activated genes such as hsp70 undergo puffing in Drosophila larval salivary glands, a local loosening of polytene chromatin structure associated with gene induction. We find that puffs acquire elevated levels of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose modified proteins and that poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) is required to produce normal-sized puffs and normal amounts of Hsp70 after heat exposure. We propose that chromosomal PARP molecules become activated by developmental or environmental cues and strip nearby chromatin proteins off DNA to generate a puff. Such local loosening may facilitate transcription and may transiently make protein complexes more accessible to modification, promoting chromatin remodeling during development.
A thermostable DNA polymerase was used in an in vitro DNA amplification procedure, the polymerase chain reaction. The enzyme, isolated from Thermus aquaticus, greatly simplifies the procedure and, by enabling the amplification reaction to be performed at higher temperatures, significantly improves the specificity, yield, sensitivity, and length of products that can be amplified. Single-copy genomic sequences were amplified by a factor of more than 10 million with very high specificity, and DNA segments up to 2000 base pairs were readily amplified. In addition, the method was used to amplify and detect a target DNA molecule present only once in a sample of 10(5) cells.
The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) enzymes, when associated with the G1 cyclins D and E, are rate-limiting for entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. During T-cell mitogenesis, antigen-receptor signalling promotes synthesis of cyclin E and its catalytic partner, Cdk2, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) signalling activates cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes. Rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressant which specifically inhibits G1-to-S-phase progression, leading to cell-cycle arrest in yeast and mammals. Here we report that IL-2 allows Cdk activation by causing the elimination of the Cdk inhibitor protein p27Kip1, and that this is prevented by rapamycin. By contrast, the Cdk inhibitor p21 is induced by IL-2 and this induction is blocked by rapamycin. Our results show that p27Kip1 governs Cdk activity during the transition from quiescence to S phase in T lymphocytes and that p21 function may be restricted to cycling cells.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates cellular metabolism in response to the availability of energy and is therefore a target for type II diabetes treatment. It senses changes in the ratio of AMP/ATP by binding both species in a competitive manner. Thus, increases in the concentration of AMP activate AMPK resulting in the phosphorylation and differential regulation of a series of downstream targets that control anabolic and catabolic pathways. We report here the crystal structure of the regulatory fragment of mammalian AMPK in complexes with AMP and ATP. The phosphate groups of AMP/ATP lie in a groove on the surface of the gamma domain, which is lined with basic residues, many of which are associated with disease-causing mutations. Structural and solution studies reveal that two sites on the gamma domain bind either AMP or Mg.ATP, whereas a third site contains a tightly bound AMP that does not exchange. Our binding studies indicate that under physiological conditions AMPK mainly exists in its inactive form in complex with Mg.ATP, which is much more abundant than AMP. Our modelling studies suggest how changes in the concentration of AMP ([AMP]) enhance AMPK activity levels. The structure also suggests a mechanism for propagating AMP/ATP signalling whereby a phosphorylated residue from the alpha and/or beta subunits binds to the gamma subunit in the presence of AMP but not when ATP is bound.
Replication complexes that contained either murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MLV RT) or a variant reverse transcriptase without a ribonuclease (RNase) H domain (delta RH MLV RT) were visualized by enzymatic footprinting. Wild-type MLV RT protected template nucleotides +6 to -27, and primer nucleotides -1 to -26 of primers that had first been extended by one or four nucleotides. Although it catalyzed DNA synthesis, delta RH MLV RT stably bound template-primer only under conditions of reduced ionic strength and protected the duplex portion only as far as position -15. Despite altered hydrolysis profiles, both enzymes covered primarily the template-primer duplex, contradicting recent predictions based on the structure of rat DNA polymerase beta.
Administration of glucose, fructose, and glycerol to fasted rats produced a significant depression of liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity within 4 to 8 hours; galactose and ribose were much less effective. All the compounds yielded appreciable quantities of liver glycogen. The depression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity by glucose and glycerol was diminished by the concomitant administration of 2-deoxyglucose. The latter depressed glycogen formation from administered carbohydrate in muscle but not in liver. In rats made diabetic by alloxan, depression of elevated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity by insulin was dependent upon a dietary source of carbohydrate. These results were interpreted to indicate that depression of certain gluconeogenic enzymes after carbohydrate ingestion is initiated by the metabolism of carbohydrate in some extrahepatic site.
The VPS34 gene product (Vps34p) is required for protein sorting to the lysosome-like vacuole of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vps34p shares significant sequence similarity with the catalytic subunit of bovine phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase [the 110-kilodalton (p110) subunit of PI 3-kinase], which is known to interact with activated cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases. Yeast strains deleted for the VPS34 gene or carrying vps34 point mutations lacked detectable PI 3-kinase activity and exhibited severe defects in vacuolar protein sorting. Overexpression of Vps34p resulted in an increase in PI 3-kinase activity, and this activity was specifically precipitated with antisera to Vps34p. VPS34 encodes a yeast PI 3-kinase, and this enzyme appears to regulate intracellular protein trafficking decisions.
Newly synthesized proteins destined either for secretion or incorporation into membranes are targeted to the membrane translocation machinery by a ubiquitous system consisting of a signal-recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor. Both the SRP receptor and the protein within the SRP that binds the signal sequence contain GTPases. These two proteins, together with the RNA component of the SRP, form a complex and thereby regulate each other's GTPase activity. Here we report the structure of the GTPase-containing portion of FtsY, the functional homologue of the SRP receptor of Escherichia coli, at 2.2 A resolution without bound nucleotide. This so-called NG domain displays similarities to the Ras-related GTPases, as well as features unique to the SRP-type GTPases, such as a separate amino-terminal domain, an insertion within the p21ras (Ras) effector domain, and a wide-open GTP-binding region. The structure explains the low affinity of FtsY for GTP, and suggests rearrangements that may occur on nucleotide binding. It also identifies regions potentially involved in the transmission of signals between domains and in interactions with regulatory proteins.
Crosslinking of B- or T-cell antigen receptors results in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including Vav, a protein expressed in cells of the haematopoietic system. Vav contains an array of structural motifs that include Src-homology domains SH2/SH3 and regions of homology to the guanine-nucleotide-exchange protein Dbl, pleckstrin and protein kinase C (refs 5-9). Using the RAG-complementation approach, we have analysed in vivo differentiation and in vitro responses of B- and T-lineage cells generated by injection of embryonic stem cells homozygous for a null mutation in the vav gene into blastocysts of RAG-1- or RAG-2-deficient mice. Here we report that antigen receptor-mediated proliferative responses of B and T cells in vitro are severely reduced in the absence of Vav. We also suggest a direct link between the low proliferative response of Vav-deficient B and T cells and the reduced number of these cells in peripheral lymphoid organs of chimaeric mice.
We present a method for sequencing DNA that relies on the motion of single RNA polymerase molecules. When a given nucleotide species limits the rate of transcription, polymerase molecules pause at positions corresponding to the rare base. An ultrastable optical trapping apparatus capable of base pair resolution was used to monitor transcription under limiting amounts of each of the four nucleotide species. From the aligned patterns of pauses recorded from as few as four molecules, we determined the DNA sequence. This proof of principle demonstrates that the motion of a processive nucleic acid enzyme may be used to extract sequence information directly from DNA.
An in vitro system reconstituted from purified proteins has been used to examine what happens when the DNA replication apparatus of bacteriophage T4 collides with an Escherichia coli RNA polymerase ternary transcription complex that is poised to move in the direction opposite to that of the moving replication fork. In the absence of a DNA helicase, the replication fork stalls for many minutes after its encounter with the RNA polymerase. However, when the T4 gene 41 DNA helicase is present, the replication fork passes the RNA polymerase after a pause of a few seconds. This brief pause is longer than the pause observed for a codirectional collision between the same two polymerases, suggesting that there is an inherent disadvantage to having replication and transcription directions oriented head to head. As for a codirectional collision, the RNA polymerase remains competent to resume faithful RNA chain elongation after the DNA replication fork passes; most strikingly, the RNA polymerase has switched from its original template strand to use the newly synthesized daughter DNA strand as the template.
The multi-subunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the principal enzyme of transcription for gene expression. Transcription is regulated by various transcription factors. Gre factor homologue 1 (Gfh1), found in the Thermus genus, is a close homologue of the well-conserved bacterial transcription factor GreA, and inhibits transcription initiation and elongation by binding directly to RNAP. The structural basis of transcription inhibition by Gfh1 has remained elusive, although the crystal structures of RNAP and Gfh1 have been determined separately. Here we report the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus RNAP complexed with Gfh1. The amino-terminal coiled-coil domain of Gfh1 fully occludes the channel formed between the two central modules of RNAP; this channel would normally be used for nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) entry into the catalytic site. Furthermore, the tip of the coiled-coil domain occupies the NTP b-g phosphate-binding site. The NTP-entry channel is expanded, because the central modules are 'ratcheted' relative to each other by ~7deg, as compared with the previously reported elongation complexes. This 'ratcheted state' is an alternative structural state, defined by a newly acquired contact between the central modules. Therefore, the shape of Gfh1 is appropriate to maintain RNAP in the ratcheted state. Simultaneously, the ratcheting expands the nucleic-acid-binding channel, and kinks the bridge helix, which connects the central modules. Taken together, the present results reveal that Gfh1 inhibits transcription by preventing NTP binding and freezing RNAP in the alternative structural state. The ratcheted state might also be associated with other aspects of transcription, such as RNAP translocation and transcription termination.
A method has been developed for the measurement of intracellular free calcium in mammalian cells. The calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin can be incorporated into isolated cells by hypo-osmotic treatment without altering the cell viability, permeability, or metabolism. Intracellular calcium activity (Cai2+) was monitored in a perfusion system. In monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2), Cai2+ is approximately 57 nanomoles per liter. Changes in Cai2+ with time can also be followed: exposure of the cells to anaerobiosis or the calcium ionophore A23187 reversibly increases Cai2+. The method has also been successfully tested in rat hepatocytes.
Modification of proteins with ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) by means of an E1-E2-E3 cascade controls many signalling networks. Ubiquitin conjugation involves adenylation and thioesterification of the carboxy-terminal carboxylate of ubiquitin by the E1-activating enzyme Ube1 (Uba1 in yeast), followed by ubiquitin transfer to an E2-conjugating enzyme through a transthiolation reaction. Charged E2s function with E3s to ubiquitinate substrates. It is currently thought that Ube1/Uba1 is the sole E1 for charging of E2s with ubiquitin in animals and fungi. Here we identify a divergent E1 in vertebrates and sea urchin, Uba6, which specifically activates ubiquitin but not other UBLs in vitro and in vivo. Human Uba6 and Ube1 have distinct preferences for E2 charging in vitro, and their specificity depends in part on their C-terminal ubiquitin-fold domains, which recruit E2s. In tissue culture cells, Uba6 is required for charging a previously uncharacterized Uba6-specific E2 (Use1), whereas Ube1 is required for charging the cell-cycle E2s Cdc34A and Cdc34B. Our data reveal unexpected complexity in the pathways that control the conjugation of ubiquitin, in which dual E1s orchestrate the charging of distinct cohorts of E2s.
The advent of techniques for cloning and rapidly sequencing DNA has produced an explosive increase of sequence information for nucleic acids and their inferred proteins. Careful study of this large store of data might give us new insights into the relations between the linear sequences of genes and their functions embodied in the three-dimensional structure of proteins, and also illuminate the origin and evolution of the structural complexity of present-day proteins. Here I argue from such a study that the active site sequences of enzymes that have analogous essential serine residues lie in fact on two lines of descent from an ancient ancestral enzyme which had a cysteine instead of serine in its active site. This is based on the assumption that the two codon types which define the separate lines of descent and which have different bases in two positions could not interconvert by single mutations.
Major epidemic outbreaks of viral hepatitis in underdeveloped countries result from a type of non-A, non-B hepatitis distinct from the parenterally transmitted form. The viral agent responsible for this form of epidemic, or enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis (ET-NANBH), has been serially transmitted in cynomolgus macaques (cynos) and has resulted in typical elevation in liver enzymes and the detection of characteristic virus-like particles (VLPs) in both feces and bile. Infectious bile was used for the construction of recombinant complementary DNA libraries. One clone, ET1.1, was exogenous to uninfected human and cyno genomic liver DNA, as well as to genomic DNA from infected cyno liver. ET1.1 did however, hybridize to an approximately 7.6-kilobase RNA species present only in infected cyno liver. The translated nucleic acid sequence of a portion of ET1.1 had a consensus amino acid motif consistent with an RNA-directed RNA polymerase; this enzyme is present in all positive strand RNA viruses. Furthermore, ET1.1 specifically identified similar sequences in complementary DNA prepared from infected human fecal samples collected from five geographically distinct ET-NANBH outbreaks. Therefore, ET1.1 represents a portion of the genome of the principal viral agent, to be named hepatitis E virus, which is responsible for epidemic outbreaks of ET-NANBH.
The RAD6 pathway is central to post-replicative DNA repair in eukaryotic cells; however, the machinery and its regulation remain poorly understood. Two principal elements of this pathway are the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes RAD6 and the MMS2-UBC13 heterodimer, which are recruited to chromatin by the RING-finger proteins RAD18 and RAD5, respectively. Here we show that UBC9, a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme, is also affiliated with this pathway and that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) -- a DNA-polymerase sliding clamp involved in DNA synthesis and repair -- is a substrate. PCNA is mono-ubiquitinated through RAD6 and RAD18, modified by lysine-63-linked multi-ubiquitination--which additionally requires MMS2, UBC13 and RAD5--and is conjugated to SUMO by UBC9. All three modifications affect the same lysine residue of PCNA, suggesting that they label PCNA for alternative functions. We demonstrate that these modifications differentially affect resistance to DNA damage, and that damage-induced PCNA ubiquitination is elementary for DNA repair and occurs at the same conserved residue in yeast and humans.
The activity of many proteins in eukaryotic cells is regulated by reversible covalent phosphorylation. This regulatory modification is often linked to other allosteric controls within the same protein, and such overlapping regulatory mechanisms are best characterized for glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1). Phosphorylases from different organisms or cell types exhibit markedly contrasting regulatory features; this makes the enzyme attractive for studying the evolution of interacting molecular regulatory mechanisms. Extensive biochemical and crystallographic studies of rabbit muscle phosphorylase have led to a characterization of five regulatory regions (phosphorylation, glycogen storage, AMP, glucose and purine sites). Here we report the complete primary structure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycogen phosphorylase, deduced from the sequence of the cloned gene. Regions that are highly conserved between muscle and yeast enzymes include the active site, the glycogen storage site and possibly the glucose and purine inhibition sites. Partial conservation of the residues involved in AMP-binding suggests a binding site for the yeast enzyme inhibitor, glucose 6-phosphate. Other parts of the AMP site and the intersubunit contacts involved in AMP allostery are disrupted in the yeast enzyme by extreme sequence divergence. The poor alignment of amino termini and lack of homology at phosphorylation sites indicate that regulation by reversible phosphorylation evolved independently in yeast and vertebrate phosphorylases.
Chromosomal aberrations are a hallmark of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) but alone fail to induce leukaemia. To identify cooperating oncogenic lesions, we performed a genome-wide analysis of leukaemic cells from 242 paediatric ALL patients using high-resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and genomic DNA sequencing. Our analyses revealed deletion, amplification, point mutation and structural rearrangement in genes encoding principal regulators of B lymphocyte development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases. The PAX5 gene was the most frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases. The identified PAX5 mutations resulted in reduced levels of PAX5 protein or the generation of hypomorphic alleles. Deletions were also detected in TCF3 (also known as E2A), EBF1, LEF1, IKZF1 (IKAROS) and IKZF3 (AIOLOS). These findings suggest that direct disruption of pathways controlling B-cell development and differentiation contributes to B-progenitor ALL pathogenesis. Moreover, these data demonstrate the power of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches to identify new molecular lesions in cancer.
Telomerase is an essential cellular ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that solves the end replication problem and maintains chromosome stability by adding telomeric DNA to the termini of linear chromosomes. Genetic mutations that abrogate the normal assembly of telomerase RNP cause human disease. It is therefore of fundamental and medical importance to decipher cellular strategies for telomerase biogenesis, which will require new insights into how specific interactions occur in a precise order along the RNP assembly pathway. Here we use a single-molecule approach to dissect the individual assembly steps of telomerase. Direct observation of complex formation in real time revealed two sequential steps of protein-induced RNA folding, establishing a hierarchical RNP assembly mechanism: interaction with the telomerase holoenzyme protein p65 induces structural rearrangement of telomerase RNA, which in turn directs the binding of the telomerase reverse transcriptase to form the functional ternary complex. This hierarchical assembly process is facilitated by an evolutionarily conserved structural motif within the RNA. These results identify the RNA folding pathway during telomerase biogenesis and define the mechanism of action for an essential telomerase holoenzyme protein.
Oedema factor, a calmodulin-activated adenylyl cyclase, is important in the pathogenesis of anthrax. Here we report the X-ray structures of oedema factor with and without bound calmodulin. Oedema factor shares no significant structural homology with mammalian adenylyl cyclases or other proteins. In the active site, 3'-deoxy-ATP and a single metal ion are well positioned for catalysis with histidine 351 as the catalytic base. This mechanism differs from the mechanism of two-metal-ion catalysis proposed for mammalian adenylyl cyclases. Four discrete regions of oedema factor form a surface that recognizes an extended conformation of calmodulin, which is very different from the collapsed conformation observed in other structures of calmodulin bound to effector peptides. On calmodulin binding, an oedema factor helical domain of relative molecular mass 15,000 undergoes a 15 A translation and a 30 degrees rotation away from the oedema factor catalytic core, which stabilizes a disordered loop and leads to enzyme activation. These allosteric changes provide the first molecular details of how calmodulin modulates one of its targets.
Screening for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) antibodies was performed on sera from 39,898 blood donors at eight blood centers in geographically distinct areas of the United States. Ten donors (0.025 percent) showed evidence of HTLV-I seropositivity by enzyme immunoassays; this was confirmed by protein immunoblot and radioimmunoprecipitation. Seroprevalence rates ranged from 0 to 0.10 percent at the locations sampled, with HTLV-I antibodies found predominantly in donors from the southeastern and southwestern United States. Matched case-control interviews and laboratory studies were performed on five seropositive women and two seropositive men who participated in an identity-linked collection of sera from a subset of 33,893 donors at six of the eight blood centers. Four of the women and both men are black; one woman is Caucasian. Four of the seven seropositive individuals admitted to prior intravenous drug abuse or sexual contact with an intravenous drug user. Sexual contact with native inhabitants of an HTLV-I endemic area was the only identified risk factor for one male. The distribution of HTLV-I antibodies in this U.S. blood donor sample corroborates the previously reported epidemiology of this agent and suggests that additional donor screening measures, including the testing of donated blood for HTLV-I markers, may be necessary to prevent the spread of HTLV-I to transfusion recipients.
The basis of the specificity of interaction of U1 and U2 small nuclear (sn)RNAs and their cognate binding proteins, U1A and U2B'', has been examined. The U1A protein recognizes U1 snRNA on its own, whereas U2B'' binds specifically to U2 snRNA only in the presence of a second protein, U2A'. Exchange of two nucleotides between the two RNAs or of eight amino acids between the two proteins reverses binding specificity.
The reprogramming of DNA-binding specificity is an important challenge for computational protein design that tests current understanding of protein-DNA recognition, and has considerable practical relevance for biotechnology and medicine. Here we describe the computational redesign of the cleavage specificity of the intron-encoded homing endonuclease I-MsoI using a physically realistic atomic-level forcefield. Using an in silico screen, we identified single base-pair substitutions predicted to disrupt binding by the wild-type enzyme, and then optimized the identities and conformations of clusters of amino acids around each of these unfavourable substitutions using Monte Carlo sampling. A redesigned enzyme that was predicted to display altered target site specificity, while maintaining wild-type binding affinity, was experimentally characterized. The redesigned enzyme binds and cleaves the redesigned recognition site approximately 10,000 times more effectively than does the wild-type enzyme, with a level of target discrimination comparable to the original endonuclease. Determination of the structure of the redesigned nuclease-recognition site complex by X-ray crystallography confirms the accuracy of the computationally predicted interface. These results suggest that computational protein design methods can have an important role in the creation of novel highly specific endonucleases for gene therapy and other applications.
A complementary DNA clone (designated GAT-1) encoding a transporter for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been isolated from rat brain, and its functional properties have been examined in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes injected with GAT-1 synthetic messenger RNA accumulated [3H]GABA to levels above control values. The transporter encoded by GAT-1 has a high affinity for GABA, is sodium-and chloride-dependent, and is pharmacologically similar to neuronal GABA transporters. The GAT-1 protein shares antigenic determinants with a native rat brain GABA transporter. The nucleotide sequence of GAT-1 predicts a protein of 599 amino acids with a molecular weight of 67 kilodaltons. Hydropathy analysis of the deduced protein suggests multiple transmembrane regions, a feature shared by several cloned transporters; however, database searches indicate that GAT-1 is not homologous to any previously identified proteins. Therefore, GAT-1 appears to be a member of a previously uncharacterized family of transport molecules.
