The giant polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster have long been of interest to the geneticist because of the visible map of the genome provided by their characteristic banding patterns. An issue in the understanding of the molecular basis of chromosome banding has been whether the chromosomal DNA is replicated to the same extent in bands and interbands. Although various suggestions have been put forward the point has remained controversial. We have isolated 315 kilobases (kb) of contiguous Drosophila genomic DNA which spans an interval of approximately 13 bands and interbands of the polytene chromosomes. We report here the measurement of the relative level of DNA replication in polytene chromosomes of 84 adjacent restriction fragments of our cloned DNA. We conclude that there are no significant differences in the level of polyteny within the large band and between bands and interbands of this region. This result supports the 'folded fibre' model of polytene chromosome organization, rather than models involving disproportionate replication along the banding pattern.
Endogenous retroviruses are multicopy retroelements accounting for nearly 10% of murine or human genomes. These retroelements spread into our ancestral genome millions of years ago and have acted as a driving force for genome evolution. Endogenous retroviruses may also be deleterious for their host, and have been implicated in cancers and autoimmune diseases. Most retroelements have lost replication competence because of the accumulation of inactivating mutations, but several, including some murine intracisternal A-particle (IAP) and MusD sequences, are still mobile. These elements encode a reverse transcriptase activity and move by retrotransposition, an intracellular copy-and-paste process involving an RNA intermediate. The host has developed mechanisms to silence their expression, mainly cosuppression and gene methylation. Here we identify another level of antiviral control, mediated by APOBEC3G, a member of the cytidine deaminase family that was previously shown to block HIV replication. We show that APOBEC3G markedly inhibits retrotransposition of IAP and MusD elements, and induces G-to-A hypermutations in their DNA copies. APOBEC3G, by editing viral genetic material, provides an ancestral wide cellular defence against endogenous and exogenous invaders.
In humans, uracil appears in DNA at the rate of several hundred bases per cell each day as a result of misincorporation of deoxyuridine (dU) or deamination of cytosine. Four enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of the glycosylic bond of dU in DNA to yield an apyridiminic site as the first step in base excision repair have been identified in the human genome. The most efficient and well characterized of these uracil-DNA glycosylases is UDG (also known as UNG and present in almost all known organisms), which excises U from single- or double-stranded DNA and is associated with DNA replication forks. We used a hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) approach to determine the mechanism of catalysis by UDG. In contrast to the concerted associative mechanism proposed initially, we show here that the reaction proceeds in a stepwise dissociative manner. Cleavage of the glycosylic bond yields an intermediate comprising an oxocarbenium cation and a uracilate anion. Subsequent attack by a water molecule and transfer of a proton to D145 result in the products. Surprisingly, the primary contribution to lowering the activation energy comes from the substrate, rather than from the enzyme. This 'autocatalysis' derives from the burial and positioning of four phosphate groups that stabilize the rate-determining transition state. The importance of these phosphates explains the residual activity observed for mutants that lack key residues. A corresponding catalytic mechanism could apply to the DNA glycosylases TDG and SMUG1, which belong to the same structural superfamily as UDG.
The protein Tat is encoded by the HIV-1 genome and is essential for viral replication because of its activation of viral transcription. Tat enhances the ability of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to move long distances down the DNA through a poorly understood mechanism that involves its binding the to the 5' end of the nascent HIV-1 transcript. It has been suggested that the stimulation of transcript elongation by conventional DNA-binding activators may involve phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II by the transcription factor TFIIH through the associated CAK kinase. Here we show that Tat-enhanced HIV-1 transcription in vitro requires both TFIIH and the CTD of Pol II. In addition, Tat, through its activation domain, both interacts with a functional TFIIH-containing complex and stimulates phosphorylation of a CTD-containing substrate by the TFIIH kinase. Under conditions that jointly restrict transcriptional elongation and TFIIH-mediated CTD phosphorylation, Tat stimulates both these activities. Furthermore, RNA synthesis is required for Tat to stimulate phosphorylation of the CTD when it is part of an initiation complex, as expected from Tat's interaction with viral transcripts. Thus, stimulation of Pol II elongation by Tat may involve direct effects on TFIIH-mediated CTD phosphorylation.
The genomes of all eukaryotes contain tracts of DNA in which a single base or a small number of bases is repeated. Expansions of such tracts have been associated with several human disorders including the fragile X syndrome. In addition, simple repeats are unstable in certain forms of colorectal cancer, suggesting a defect in DNA replication or repair. We show here that mutations in any three yeast genes involved in DNA mismatch repair (PMS1, MLH1 and MSH2) lead to 100- to 700-fold increases in tract instability, whereas mutations that eliminate the proof-reading function of DNA polymerases have little effect. The meiotic stability of the tracts is similar to the mitotic stability. These results suggest that tract instability is associated with DNA polymerases slipping during replication, and that some types of colorectal cancer may reflect mutations in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair.
Phosphate-methylated DNA hybridizes strongly and specifically to natural DNA and RNA. Hybridization to single-stranded and double-stranded DNA leads to site-selective blocking of replication and transcription. Phosphate-methylated DNA was used to interrupt the life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Both antisense and sense phosphate-methylated DNA 20-nucleotide oligomers, targeted at the transactivator responsive region and the primer binding site, caused complete inhibition of viral infectivity at a low concentration. Hybridization of phosphate-methylated DNA with folded and unfolded RNA was studied by ultraviolet and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The combined results of hybridization studies and biological experiments suggest that the design of effective antisense phosphate-methylated DNA should focus on hairpin loop structures in the viral RNA. For sense systems, the 5' end of the integrated viral genome is considered to be the important target site.
Herpesvirus saimiri naturally infects squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) without producing signs of disease; infection of other New World primates, however, results in a rapidly progressing, malignant, T-cell lymphoma. Results described in this report identify a region of the viral genome that is required for oncogenicity in owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus); this region is not required for replication of the virus. This is believed to be the first such genomic region identified in a herpesvirus system.
We have investigated the ability of different regions of the left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome V to participate in the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs). We found that the 4.2-kilobase HXT13-DSF1 region sharing divergent homology with chromosomes IV, X and XIV, similar to mammalian segmental duplications, was 'at risk' for participating in duplication-mediated GCRs generated by homologous recombination. Numerous genes and pathways, including SGS1, TOP3, RMI1, SRS2, RAD6, SLX1, SLX4, SLX5, MSH2, MSH6, RAD10 and the DNA replication stress checkpoint requiring MRC1 and TOF1, were highly specific for suppressing these GCRs compared to GCRs mediated by single-copy sequences. These results indicate that the mechanisms for formation and suppression of rearrangements occurring in regions containing at-risk sequences differ from those occurring in regions of single-copy sequence. This explains how extensive genome instability is prevented in eukaryotic cells whose genomes contain numerous divergent repeated sequences.
Post-replication repair (PRR) is a pathway that allows cells to bypass or overcome lesions during DNA replication. In eukaryotes, damage bypass is activated by ubiquitylation of the replication clamp PCNA through components of the RAD6 pathway. Whereas monoubiquitylation of PCNA allows mutagenic translesion synthesis by damage-tolerant DNA polymerases, polyubiquitylation is required for an error-free pathway that probably involves a template switch to the undamaged sister chromatid. Both the timing of PRR events during the cell cycle and their location relative to replication forks, as well as the factors required downstream of PCNA ubiquitylation, have remained poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that the RAD6 pathway normally operates during S phase. However, using an inducible system of DNA damage bypass in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), we show that the process is separable in time and space from genome replication, thus allowing direct visualization and quantification of productive PRR tracts. We found that both during and after S phase ultraviolet-radiation-induced lesions are bypassed predominantly via translesion synthesis, whereas the error-free pathway functions as a backup system. Our approach has revealed the distribution of PRR tracts in a synchronized cell population. It will allow an in-depth mechanistic analysis of how cells manage the processing of lesions to their genomes during and after replication.
Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is the aetiological agent of AIDS. The virus establishes lytic, latent and non-cytopathic productive infection in cells in culture. The complexity of virus-host cell interaction is reflected in the complex organization of the viral genome. In addition to the genes that encode the virion capsid and envelope proteins and the enzymes required for proviral synthesis and integration common to all retroviruses, HIV-1 is known to encode at least four additional proteins that regulate virus replication, the tat, art, sor and 3' orf proteins, as well as a protein of unknown function from the open reading frame called R. Close examination of the nucleic acid sequences of the genomes of multiple HIV isolates raised the possibility that the virus encodes a previously undetected additional protein. Here we report that HIV-1 encodes a ninth protein and that antibodies to this protein are detected in the sera of people infected with HIV-1. This protein distinguishes HIV-1 isolates from the other human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-2 and SIV) that do not have the capacity to encode a similar protein.
DNA replication origins are fundamental to chromosome organization and duplication, but understanding of these elements is limited because only a small fraction of these sites have been identified in eukaryotic genomes. Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins form prereplicative complexes at origins of replication. Using these proteins as molecular landmarks for origins, we identified ORC- and MCM-bound sites throughout the yeast genome. Four hundred twenty-nine sites in the yeast genome were predicted to contain replication origins, and approximately 80% of the loci identified on chromosome X demonstrated origin function. A substantial fraction of the predicted origins are associated with repetitive DNA sequences, including subtelomeric elements (X and Y') and transposable element-associated sequences (long terminal repeats). These findings identify the global set of yeast replication origins and open avenues of investigation into the role(s) ORC and MCM proteins play in chromosomal architecture and dynamics.
The methylation of vertebrate DNA at the 5-position of approximately 3-10% of its cytosine residues occurs in a sequence-specific and tissue-specific manner and has been implicated in the control of transcription. How these differences are established and how they mediate the initiation or maintenance of transcription are unknown. DNA methylation might also have other roles, such as modulating DNA replication, transposition, DNA repair or chromosome configuration. These other roles suggested for DNA methylation would be consistent with the finding that tissue-specific differences in methylation of certain gene regions, highly repeated satellite DNA sequences and whole genomes often do not correlate with transcriptional activity. For DNA methylation to modulate the expression, maintenance or duplication of chromosomes, there should be effector macromolecules, presumably proteins, which specifically recognize 5-methylcytosine (m5C) residues in DNA. We describe here the first identification of a mammalian protein that binds preferentially to m5C-rich DNA sequences.
Retroviruses are the only group of viruses known to have left a fossil record, in the form of endogenous proviruses, and approximately 8% of the human genome is made up of these elements. Although many other viruses, including non-retroviral RNA viruses, are known to generate DNA forms of their own genomes during replication, none has been found as DNA in the germline of animals. Bornaviruses, a genus of non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus, are unique among RNA viruses in that they establish persistent infection in the cell nucleus. Here we show that elements homologous to the nucleoprotein (N) gene of bornavirus exist in the genomes of several mammalian species, including humans, non-human primates, rodents and elephants. These sequences have been designated endogenous Borna-like N (EBLN) elements. Some of the primate EBLNs contain an intact open reading frame (ORF) and are expressed as mRNA. Phylogenetic analyses showed that EBLNs seem to have been generated by different insertional events in each specific animal family. Furthermore, the EBLN of a ground squirrel was formed by a recent integration event, whereas those in primates must have been formed more than 40 million years ago. We also show that the N mRNA of a current mammalian bornavirus, Borna disease virus (BDV), can form EBLN-like elements in the genomes of persistently infected cultured cells. Our results provide the first evidence for endogenization of non-retroviral virus-derived elements in mammalian genomes and give novel insights not only into generation of endogenous elements, but also into a role of bornavirus as a source of genetic novelty in its host.
Several recent discoveries have pointed to nucleic acid secondary structure as an additional dimension in gene expression. Further evidence for the formation of hairpins in RNA is the fact that cruciforms exist in negatively supercoiled DNAs. As potential binding sites for proteins, these structures have been proposed to play a part in the regulation of various crucial reactions, such as replication, transcription, or RNA processing. As any random nucleotide sequence can self-anneal with an approximately 50% chance of forming some Watson-Crick-type base pairs, it is difficult to assess which, if any, of all possible hairpin-like secondary structures may be biologically relevant. We have computed the expected distribution of perfectly base-paired structures as a function of loop size and stem length and compared it with the distribution observed in the complete genome of eight DNA viruses from animals, plants and bacteria. We report here that hairpins having six or more consecutive base pairs in the stem are not distributed randomly long the genome, occur much more often than chance would predict, and are particularly over-represented in regions that appear to have regulatory significance. The average loop size was found to decrease with an increase in stem length. These results support our previous hypothesis that these structures are biologically relevant.
The dependence of cell-cycle progression on the integrity of the genome has been described as checkpoint control. A number of mutants of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, selected for their sensitivity to DNA damage caused by radiation (rad mutants) or to the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea (hus mutants) have been classified as checkpoint mutants because they fail to arrest the cell cycle in response to DNA damage or incompletely replicated DNA. Coupling of the checkpoint pathways that monitor DNA repair and replication to control of the cell cycle is essential. In a search for components that interact with the cell-cycle regulatory kinase p34cdc2, we have identified a novel fission yeast protein kinase homologue which is involved in cell-cycle arrest when DNA damage has occurred or when unligated DNA is present. We have called the gene encoding this protein chk1 for checkpoint kinase. Multiple copies of chk1 partially rescue the ultraviolet sensitivity of rad1-1, a mutant deficient in checkpoint control. Identification of a gene involved in checkpoint control as a rescue of a cdc2 mutant links the rad1-dependent DNA-damage-sensing pathway and p34cdc2 activity.
Dehydration or desiccation is one of the most frequent and severe challenges to living cells. The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is the best known extremophile among the few organisms that can survive extremely high exposures to desiccation and ionizing radiation, which shatter its genome into hundreds of short DNA fragments. Remarkably, these fragments are readily reassembled into a functional 3.28-megabase genome. Here we describe the relevant two-stage DNA repair process, which involves a previously unknown molecular mechanism for fragment reassembly called 'extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing' (ESDSA), followed and completed by crossovers. At least two genome copies and random DNA breakage are requirements for effective ESDSA. In ESDSA, chromosomal fragments with overlapping homologies are used both as primers and as templates for massive synthesis of complementary single strands, as occurs in a single-round multiplex polymerase chain reaction. This synthesis depends on DNA polymerase I and incorporates more nucleotides than does normal replication in intact cells. Newly synthesized complementary single-stranded extensions become 'sticky ends' that anneal with high precision, joining together contiguous DNA fragments into long, linear, double-stranded intermediates. These intermediates require RecA-dependent crossovers to mature into circular chromosomes that comprise double-stranded patchworks of numerous DNA blocks synthesized before radiation, connected by DNA blocks synthesized after radiation.
The Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), which is used for the overexpression of eukaryotic genes and is being engineered for possible use as a viral insecticide, has a circular, supercoiled genome of approximately 128 kilobases. Despite its widespread use, little is known about the mechanism by which AcMNPV replicates. Evidence is presented in this report that AcMNPV origins of DNA replication are repeated sequences each containing several closely related imperfect palindromes that are present in six regions distributed around the genome. Although AcMNPV infection-dependent plasmid replication was initiated by a single complete palindrome, the amount of replication was substantially increased in plasmids containing six or eight palindromes.
The genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like those of other eukaryotes, contains multiple sequences that hybridize with a poly(GT) probe. We have shown previously that some of the sequences that hybridize with the poly(GT) probe are located near the tips of the yeast chromosomes. We report here that many of the remaining poly(GT)-hybridizing sequences are associated with a family of putative replication origins localized near the chromosome ends. These sequences have the general form poly(C1-3A), similar to sequences reported to occur at the tips of chromosomes in the accompanying paper. In addition to poly(C1-3A) tracts, yeast cells contain tracts of alternating C and A bases, similar to those seen in mammalian genomes. These results are used as the basis for a new model of telomere replication.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in humans and is characterized by chaotic electrical activity of the atria. It affects one in ten individuals over the age of 80 years, causes significant morbidity and is an independent predictor of mortality. Recent studies have provided evidence of a genetic contribution to AF. Mutations in potassium-channel genes have been associated with familial AF but account for only a small fraction of all cases of AF. We have performed a genome-wide association scan, followed by replication studies in three populations of European descent and a Chinese population from Hong Kong and find a strong association between two sequence variants on chromosome 4q25 and AF. Here we show that about 35% of individuals of European descent have at least one of the variants and that the risk of AF increases by 1.72 and 1.39 per copy. The association with the stronger variant is replicated in the Chinese population, where it is carried by 75% of individuals and the risk of AF is increased by 1.42 per copy. A stronger association was observed in individuals with typical atrial flutter. Both variants are adjacent to PITX2, which is known to have a critical function in left-right asymmetry of the heart.
The integral membrane protein M2 of influenza virus forms pH-gated proton channels in the viral lipid envelope. The low pH of an endosome activates the M2 channel before haemagglutinin-mediated fusion. Conductance of protons acidifies the viral interior and thereby facilitates dissociation of the matrix protein from the viral nucleoproteins--a required process for unpacking of the viral genome. In addition to its role in release of viral nucleoproteins, M2 in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) membrane prevents premature conformational rearrangement of newly synthesized haemagglutinin during transport to the cell surface by equilibrating the pH of the TGN with that of the host cell cytoplasm. Inhibiting the proton conductance of M2 using the anti-viral drug amantadine or rimantadine inhibits viral replication. Here we present the structure of the tetrameric M2 channel in complex with rimantadine, determined by NMR. In the closed state, four tightly packed transmembrane helices define a narrow channel, in which a 'tryptophan gate' is locked by intermolecular interactions with aspartic acid. A carboxy-terminal, amphipathic helix oriented nearly perpendicular to the transmembrane helix forms an inward-facing base. Lowering the pH destabilizes the transmembrane helical packing and unlocks the gate, admitting water to conduct protons, whereas the C-terminal base remains intact, preventing dissociation of the tetramer. Rimantadine binds at four equivalent sites near the gate on the lipid-facing side of the channel and stabilizes the closed conformation of the pore. Drug-resistance mutations are predicted to counter the effect of drug binding by either increasing the hydrophilicity of the pore or weakening helix-helix packing, thus facilitating channel opening.
Multiple DNA polymerases participate in replicating the leading and lagging strands of the eukaryotic nuclear genome. Although 50 years have passed since the first DNA polymerase was discovered, the identity of the major polymerase used for leading-strand replication is uncertain. We constructed a derivative of yeast DNA polymerase epsilon that retains high replication activity but has strongly reduced replication fidelity, particularly for thymine-deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate (T-dTMP) but not adenine-deoxyadenosine 5'-monophosphate (A-dAMP) mismatches. Yeast strains with this DNA polymerase epsilon allele have elevated rates of T to A substitution mutations. The position and rate of these substitutions depend on the orientation of the mutational reporter and its location relative to origins of DNA replication and reveal a pattern indicating that DNA polymerase epsilon participates in leading-strand DNA replication.
Innate immune defences are essential for the control of virus infection and are triggered through host recognition of viral macromolecular motifs known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an RNA virus that replicates in the liver, and infects 200 million people worldwide. Infection is regulated by hepatic immune defences triggered by the cellular RIG-I helicase. RIG-I binds PAMP RNA and signals interferon regulatory factor 3 activation to induce the expression of interferon-alpha/beta and antiviral/interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that limit infection. Here we identify the polyuridine motif of the HCV genome 3' non-translated region and its replication intermediate as the PAMP substrate of RIG-I, and show that this and similar homopolyuridine or homopolyriboadenine motifs present in the genomes of RNA viruses are the chief feature of RIG-I recognition and immune triggering in human and murine cells. 5' terminal triphosphate on the PAMP RNA was necessary but not sufficient for RIG-I binding, which was primarily dependent on homopolymeric ribonucleotide composition, linear structure and length. The HCV PAMP RNA stimulated RIG-I-dependent signalling to induce a hepatic innate immune response in vivo, and triggered interferon and ISG expression to suppress HCV infection in vitro. These results provide a conceptual advance by defining specific homopolymeric RNA motifs within the genome of HCV and other RNA viruses as the PAMP substrate of RIG-I, and demonstrate immunogenic features of the PAMP-RIG-I interaction that could be used as an immune adjuvant for vaccine and immunotherapy approaches.
DNA replication is initiated at numerous origins of replication (oris) within the chromosomes. In a pair of ambitious studies, two groups have used different techniques to pinpoint the locations of all of the oris throughout the yeast genome at different times during S phase (Raghuraman et al., Wyrick et al.). Stillman, in his Perspective, compares and contrasts the different methods and their findings, and speculates on the value of combining these techniques to look at oris in the human genome.
The mutation rates of viroids, plant pathogens with minimal non-protein-coding RNA genomes, are unknown. Their replication is mediated by host RNA polymerases and, in some cases, by hammerhead ribozymes, small self-cleaving motifs embedded in the viroid. By using the principle that the population frequency of nonviable genotypes equals the mutation rate, we screened for changes that inactivated the hammerheads of Chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid. We obtained a mutation rate of 1/400 per site, the highest reported for any biological entity. Such error-prone replication can only be tolerated by extremely simple genomes such as those of viroids and, presumably, the primitive replicons of the RNA world. Our results suggest that the emergence of replication fidelity was critical for the evolution of complexity in the early history of life.
Chromatin assembly is a fundamental biological process that is essential for the replication and maintenance of the eukaryotic genome. In dividing cells, newly synthesized DNA is rapidly assembled into chromatin by the deposition of a tetramer of the histone proteins H3 and H4, followed by the deposition of two dimers of histones H2A and H2B to complete the nucleosome-the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin. Here we describe the identification, purification, cloning, and characterization of replication-coupling assembly factor (RCAF), a novel protein complex that facilitates the assembly of nucleosomes onto newly replicated DNA in vitro. RCAF comprises the Drosophila homologue of anti-silencing function 1 protein ASF1 and histones H3 and H4. The specific acetylation pattern of H3 and H4 in RCAF is identical to that of newly synthesized histones. Genetic analyses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrate that ASF1 is essential for normal cell cycle progression, and suggest that RCAF mediates chromatin assembly after DNA replication and the repair of double-strand DNA damage in vivo.
Papillomaviruses cause warts and proliferative lesions in skin and other epithelia. In a minority of papillomavirus types ('high risk, including human papillomaviruses 16, 18, 31, 33, 45 and 56), further transformation of the wart lesions can produce tumours. The papillomavirus E2 protein controls primary transcription and replication of the viral genome. Both activities are governed by a approximately 200 amino-acid amino-terminal module (E2NT) which is connected to a DNA-binding carboxy-terminal module by a flexible linker. Here we describe the crystal structure of the complete E2NT module from human papillomavirus 16. The E2NT module forms a dimer both in the crystal and in solution. Amino acids that are necessary for transactivation are located at the dimer interface, indicating that the dimer structure may be important in the interactions of E2NT with viral and cellular transcription factors. We propose that dimer formation may contribute to the stabilization of DNA loops which may serve to relocate distal DNA-binding transcription factors to the site of human papillomavirus transcription initiation.
Hepatitis C virus is a major global health problem affecting an estimated 170 million people worldwide. Chronic infection is common and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. There is no vaccine available and current therapies have met with limited success. The viral RNA genome encodes a polyprotein that includes two proteases essential for virus replication. The NS2-3 protease mediates a single cleavage at the NS2/NS3 junction, whereas the NS3-4A protease cleaves at four downstream sites in the polyprotein. NS3-4A is characterized as a serine protease with a chymotrypsin-like fold, but the enzymatic mechanism of the NS2-3 protease remains unresolved. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of the NS2-3 protease at 2.3 A resolution. The structure reveals a dimeric cysteine protease with two composite active sites. For each active site, the catalytic histidine and glutamate residues are contributed by one monomer, and the nucleophilic cysteine by the other. The carboxy-terminal residues remain coordinated in the two active sites, predicting an inactive post-cleavage form. Proteolysis through formation of a composite active site occurs in the context of the viral polyprotein expressed in mammalian cells. These features offer unexpected insights into polyprotein processing by hepatitis C virus and new opportunities for antiviral drug design.
We report the design, synthesis, and assembly of the 1.08-mega-base pair Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0 genome starting from digitized genome sequence information and its transplantation into a M. capricolum recipient cell to create new M. mycoides cells that are controlled only by the synthetic chromosome. The only DNA in the cells is the designed synthetic DNA sequence, including "watermark" sequences and other designed gene deletions and polymorphisms, and mutations acquired during the building process. The new cells have expected phenotypic properties and are capable of continuous self-replication.
Mammalian viruses often use components of the host's cellular DNA replication machinery to carry out replication of their genomes, which enables these viruses to be used as tools for characterizing factors that are involved in cellular DNA replication. The human papillomavirus (HPV) E1 protein is essential for replication of the virus DNA. Here we identify the cellular factor that participates in viral DNA replication by using a two-hybrid assay in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E1 protein as bait. Using this assay, we isolated Inil/hSNF5, a component of the SWI/SNF complex which facilitates transcription by altering the structure of chromatin. In vitro binding and immunoprecipitation confirmed that E1 interacts directly with Ini1/hSNF5. Transient DNA-replication assay revealed that HPV DNA replication is stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by addition of Ini1/hSNF5, and that Ini1/hSNF5 antisense RNA blocks the replication of HPV DNA. Amino-acid substitution at residues that are conserved among E1 proteins prevented the E1-Ini1/hSNF5 interaction and reduced DNA replication of HPV in vivo. Our results indicate that Ini1/hSNF5 is required for the efficient replication of papillomavirus DNA and is therefore needed, either alone or in complex with SWI/SNF complex, for mammalian DNA replication as well.
The sequence of the entire RNA genome of the type flavivirus, yellow fever virus, has been obtained. Inspection of this sequence reveals a single long open reading frame of 10,233 nucleotides, which could encode a polypeptide of 3411 amino acids. The structural proteins are found within the amino-terminal 780 residues of this polyprotein; the remainder of the open reading frame consists of nonstructural viral polypeptides. This genome organization implies that mature viral proteins are produced by posttranslational cleavage of a polyprotein precursor and has implications for flavivirus RNA replication and for the evolutionary relation of this virus family to other RNA viruses.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has a small genome and therefore relies heavily on the host cellular machinery to replicate. Identifying which host proteins and complexes come into physical contact with the viral proteins is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how HIV rewires the host's cellular machinery during the course of infection. Here we report the use of affinity tagging and purification mass spectrometry to determine systematically the physical interactions of all 18 HIV-1 proteins and polyproteins with host proteins in two different human cell lines (HEK293 and Jurkat). Using a quantitative scoring system that we call MiST, we identified with high confidence 497 HIV-human protein-protein interactions involving 435 individual human proteins, with ~40% of the interactions being identified in both cell types. We found that the host proteins hijacked by HIV, especially those found interacting in both cell types, are highly conserved across primates. We uncovered a number of host complexes targeted by viral proteins, including the finding that HIV protease cleaves eIF3d, a subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. This host protein is one of eleven identified in this analysis that act to inhibit HIV replication. This data set facilitates a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of how the host machinery is manipulated during the course of HIV infection.
The genome of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 contains at least eight genes, of which three (sor, R, and 3' orf) have no known function. In this study, the role of the sor gene was examined by constructing a series of proviral genomes of HIV-1 that either lacked the coding sequences for sor or contained point mutations in sor. Analysis of four such mutants revealed that although each clone could generate morphologically normal virus particles upon transfection, the mutant viruses were limited in their capacity to establish stable infection. Virus derived from transfection of Cos-1 cells (OKT4-) with sor mutant proviral DNA's was resistant to transmission to OKT4+ "susceptible" cells under cell-free conditions, and was transmitted poorly by coculture. In contrast, virus derived from clones with an intact sor frame was readily propagated by either approach. Normal amounts of gag-, env-, and pol-derived proteins were produced by all four mutants and assays in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells indicated that their trans-activating capacity was intact and comparable with wild type. Thus the sor gene, although not absolutely required in HIV virion formation, influences virus transmission in vitro and is crucial in the efficient generation of infectious virus. The data also suggest that sor influences virus replication at a novel, post-translational stage and that its action is independent of the regulatory genes tat and trs.
DNA replication in mammals is temporally bimodal. "Housekeeping" genes, which are active in all cells, replicate during the first half of the S phase of cell growth. Tissue-specific genes replicate early in those cells in which they are potentially expressed, and they usually replicate late in tissues in which they are not expressed. Replication during the first half of the S phase is, therefore, a necessary but not sufficient condition for gene transcription. A change in the replication timing of a tissue-specific gene appears to reflect the commitment of that gene to transcriptional competence or to quiescence during ontogeny. Most families of middle repetitive sequences replicate either early or late. These data are consistent with a model in which two functionally distinct genomes coexist in the nucleus.
To maintain genome stability in eukaryotic cells, DNA is licensed for replication only after the cell has completed mitosis, ensuring that DNA synthesis (S phase) occurs once every cell cycle. This licensing control is thought to require the protein Cdc6 (Cdc18 in fission yeast) as a mediator for association of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins with chromatin. The control is overridden in fission yeast by overexpressing Cdc18 (ref. 11) which leads to continued DNA synthesis in the absence of mitosis. Other factors acting in this control have been postulated and we have used a re-replication assay to identify Cdt1 (ref. 14) as one such factor. Cdt1 cooperates with Cdc18 to promote DNA replication, interacts with Cdc18, is located in the nucleus, and its concentration peaks as cells finish mitosis and proceed to S phase. Both Cdc18 and Cdt1 are required to load the MCM protein Cdc21 onto chromatin at the end of mitosis and this is necessary to initiate DNA replication. Genes related to Cdt1 have been found in Metazoa and plants (A. Whitaker, I. Roysman and T. Orr-Weaver, personal communication), suggesting that the cooperation of Cdc6/Cdc18 with Cdt1 to load MCM proteins onto chromatin may be a generally conserved feature of DNA licensing in eukaryotes.
Many helicases modulate recombination, an essential process that needs to be tightly controlled. Mutations in some human disease helicases cause increased recombination, genome instability and cancer. To elucidate the potential mode of action of these enzymes, here we developed a single-molecule fluorescence assay that can visualize DNA binding and translocation of Escherichia coli Rep, a superfamily 1 DNA helicase homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Srs2. Individual Rep monomers were observed to move on single-stranded (ss)DNA in the 3' to 5' direction using ATP hydrolysis. Strikingly, on hitting a blockade, such as duplex DNA or streptavidin, the protein abruptly snapped back close to its initial position, followed by further cycles of translocation and snapback. This repetitive shuttling is likely to be caused by a blockade-induced protein conformational change that enhances DNA affinity for the protein's secondary DNA binding site, thereby resulting in a transient DNA loop. Repetitive shuttling was also observed on ssDNA bounded by a stalled replication fork and an Okazaki fragment analogue, and the presence of Rep delayed formation of a filament of recombination protein RecA on ssDNA. Thus, the binding of a single Rep monomer to a stalled replication fork can lead to repetitive shuttling along the single-stranded region, possibly keeping the DNA clear of toxic recombination intermediates.
The complete genome sequence of Treponema pallidum was determined and shown to be 1,138,006 base pairs containing 1041 predicted coding sequences (open reading frames). Systems for DNA replication, transcription, translation, and repair are intact, but catabolic and biosynthetic activities are minimized. The number of identifiable transporters is small, and no phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase carbohydrate transporters were found. Potential virulence factors include a family of 12 potential membrane proteins and several putative hemolysins. Comparison of the T. pallidum genome sequence with that of another pathogenic spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, identified unique and common genes and substantiates the considerable diversity observed among pathogenic spirochetes.
MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that regulate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. MicroRNA 122 (miR-122) is specifically expressed and highly abundant in the human liver. We show that the sequestration of miR-122 in liver cells results in marked loss of autonomously replicating hepatitis C viral RNAs. A genetic interaction between miR-122 and the 5' noncoding region of the viral genome was revealed by mutational analyses of the predicted microRNA binding site and ectopic expression of miR-122 molecules containing compensatory mutations. Studies with replication-defective RNAs suggested that miR-122 did not detectably affect mRNA translation or RNA stability. Therefore, miR-122 is likely to facilitate replication of the viral RNA, suggesting that miR-122 may present a target for antiviral intervention.
The generation of a double-strand break in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is a potentially catastrophic event that can induce cell-cycle arrest or ultimately result in loss of cell viability. The repair of such lesions is strongly dependent on proteins encoded by the RAD52 epistasis group of genes (RAD50-55, RAD57, MRE11, XRS2), as well as the RFA1 and RAD59 genes. rad52 mutants exhibit the most severe phenotypic defects in double-strand break repair, but almost nothing is known about the biochemical role of Rad52 protein. Rad51 protein promotes DNA strand exchange and acts similarly to RecA protein. Yeast Rad52 protein interacts with Rad51 protein, binds single-stranded DNA and stimulates annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA. We find that Rad52 protein stimulates DNA strand exchange by targeting Rad51 protein to a complex of replication protein A (RPA) with single-stranded DNA. Rad52 protein affects an early step in the reaction, presynaptic filament formation, by overcoming the inhibitory effects of the competitor, RPA. Furthermore, stimulation is dependent on the concerted action of both Rad51 protein and RPA, implying that specific protein-protein interactions between Rad52 protein, Rad51 protein and RPA are required.
The genome of the eukaryotic protist Giardia lamblia, an important human intestinal parasite, is compact in structure and content, contains few introns or mitochondrial relics, and has simplified machinery for DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing, and most metabolic pathways. Protein kinases comprise the single largest protein class and reflect Giardia's requirement for a complex signal transduction network for coordinating differentiation. Lateral gene transfer from bacterial and archaeal donors has shaped Giardia's genome, and previously unknown gene families, for example, cysteine-rich structural proteins, have been discovered. Unexpectedly, the genome shows little evidence of heterozygosity, supporting recent speculations that this organism is sexual. This genome sequence will not only be valuable for investigating the evolution of eukaryotes, but will also be applied to the search for new therapeutics for this parasite.
