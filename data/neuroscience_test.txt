In the fruit fly Drosophila, four insulin genes are coexpressed in small clusters of cells [insulin-producing cells (IPCs)] in the brain. Here, we show that ablation of these IPCs causes developmental delay, growth retardation, and elevated carbohydrate levels in larval hemolymph. All of the defects were reversed by ectopic expression of a Drosophila insulin transgene. On the basis of these functional data and the observation that IPCs release insulin into the circulatory system, we conclude that brain IPCs are the main systemic supply of insulin during larval growth. We propose that IPCs and pancreatic islet beta cells are functionally analogous and may have evolved from a common ancestral insulin-producing neuron. Interestingly, the phenotype of flies lacking IPCs includes certain features of diabetes mellitus.
The brain processes information by transmitting signals at synapses, which connect neurons into vast networks of communicating cells. In these networks, synapses not only transmit signals but also transform and refine them. Neurexins and neuroligins are synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that connect presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons at synapses, mediate signalling across the synapse, and shape the properties of neural networks by specifying synaptic functions. In humans, alterations in genes encoding neurexins or neuroligins have recently been implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases, linking synaptic cell adhesion to cognition and its disorders.
The brain's circuitry is established by directed migration and synaptogenesis of neurons during development. Although neurons mature and migrate in specific patterns, little is known about how neurons exit their germinal zone niche. We found that cerebellar granule neuron germinal zone exit is regulated by proteasomal degradation of Pard3A by the Seven in Absentia homolog (Siah) E3 ubiquitin ligase. Pard3A gain of function and Siah loss of function induce precocious radial migration. Time-lapse imaging using a probe to measure neuronal cell contact reveals that Pard3A promotes adhesive interactions needed for germinal zone exit by recruiting the epithelial tight junction adhesion molecule C to the neuronal cell surface. Our findings define a Siah-Pard3A signaling pathway that controls adhesion-dependent exit of neuronal progenitors or immature neurons from a germinal zone niche.
Western tonal music relies on a formal geometric structure that determines distance relationships within a harmonic or tonal space. In functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we identified an area in the rostromedial prefrontal cortex that tracks activation in tonal space. Different voxels in this area exhibited selectivity for different keys. Within the same set of consistently activated voxels, the topography of tonality selectivity rearranged itself across scanning sessions. The tonality structure was thus maintained as a dynamic topography in cortical areas known to be at a nexus of cognitive, affective, and mnemonic processing.
Why dopamine-containing neurons of the brain's substantia nigra pars compacta die in Parkinson's disease has been an enduring mystery. Our studies suggest that the unusual reliance of these neurons on L-type Ca(v)1.3 Ca2+ channels to drive their maintained, rhythmic pacemaking renders them vulnerable to stressors thought to contribute to disease progression. The reliance on these channels increases with age, as juvenile dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta use pacemaking mechanisms common to neurons not affected in Parkinson's disease. These mechanisms remain latent in adulthood, and blocking Ca(v)1.3 Ca2+ channels in adult neurons induces a reversion to the juvenile form of pacemaking. Such blocking ('rejuvenation') protects these neurons in both in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease, pointing to a new strategy that could slow or stop the progression of the disease.
Electrophysiological studies indicate the existence of several types of receptors for excitatory amino acids. Thus, responses induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) are potently and selectively blocked by D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), while responses induced by such agonists as kainate and quisqualate are relatively resistant to this antagonist. Evidence is mounting that excitatory amino acid receptors are involved in synaptic excitation in many regions of the central nervous system (see refs 1 and 4 for reviews). Although the identity of the transmitter(s) acting at these receptors remains uncertain, L-aspartate has been considered the most likely transmitter at NMDA receptors and L-glutamate at kainate/quisqualate receptors. Other endogenous acidic amino acids proposed as possible transmitters include a range of sulphur-containing amino acids and the tryptophan metabolite, quinolinic acid. Ligand-binding studies offer a means not only of assessing receptor densities in different brain regions but also of comparing affinities of transmitter candidates for these receptors. However, to avoid difficulties of interpretation arising from the use of ligands which bind to more than one type of receptor, such as [3H]-L-glutamate and [3H]-L-aspartate (for example, refs 8-12), ligands with high receptor selectivity are required. Here, we report that [3H]-D-AP5 binds specifically to rat brain membranes, that the hippocampus and cerebral cortex are enriched in these sites relative to other brain areas and that L-glutamate has higher affinity for these receptors than have all other transmitter candidates tested.
To examine the possibility that alterations in the effectiveness of electrical synapses might participate in epileptogenesis, the effects of several convulsants on an identified weak electrical synapse in Aplysia were examined. Application of pentylenetetrazole, strychnine, or tetraethylammonium led to a dramatic increase in the size of the electrical postsynaptic potential mediated by the synapse; penicillin was considerably less effective. In a number of animals, the increased electrical synaptic effectiveness led to the abnormal conduction of spikes across the synapse. If convulsants have a similar action in mammalian cortex, enhanced transmission at weak electrical synapses may provide abnormal pathways for the flow of seizure activity and contribute in part to the synchronous firing of neurons characteristic of epileptic activity.
N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) are a major class of excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system. They form glutamate-gated ion channels that are highly permeable to calcium and mediate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. NMDAR dysfunction is implicated in multiple brain disorders, including stroke, chronic pain and schizophrenia. NMDARs exist as multiple subtypes with distinct pharmacological and biophysical properties that are largely determined by the type of NR2 subunit (NR2A to NR2D) incorporated in the heteromeric NR1/NR2 complex. A fundamental difference between NMDAR subtypes is their channel maximal open probability (P(o)), which spans a 50-fold range from about 0.5 for NR2A-containing receptors to about 0.01 for receptors containing NR2C and NR2D; NR2B-containing receptors have an intermediate value (about 0.1). These differences in P(o) confer unique charge transfer capacities and signalling properties on each receptor subtype. The molecular basis for this profound difference in activity between NMDAR subtypes is unknown. Here we show that the subunit-specific gating of NMDARs is controlled by the region formed by the NR2 amino-terminal domain (NTD), an extracellular clamshell-like domain previously shown to bind allosteric inhibitors, and the short linker connecting the NTD to the agonist-binding domain (ABD). The subtype specificity of NMDAR P(o) largely reflects differences in the spontaneous (ligand-independent) equilibrium between open-cleft and closed-cleft conformations of the NR2-NTD. This NTD-driven gating control also affects pharmacological properties by setting the sensitivity to the endogenous inhibitors zinc and protons. Our results provide a proof of concept for a drug-based bidirectional control of NMDAR activity by using molecules acting either as NR2-NTD 'closers' or 'openers' promoting receptor inhibition or potentiation, respectively.
Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a member of an expanding family of neurotrophic factors (including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the neurotrophins) that control the development and survival of certain neuronal populations both in the peripheral and in the central nervous systems. Its biological effects are mediated by a high-affinity ligand-receptor interaction and a tyrosine kinase signalling pathway. A potential use for NGF and its relatives in the treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease requires an understanding of the structure-function relationships of NGF. NGF is a dimeric molecule, with 118 amino acids per protomer. We report the crystal structure of the murine NGF dimer at 2.3-A resolution, which reveals a novel protomer structure consisting of three antiparallel pairs of beta strands, together forming a flat surface. Two subunits associate through this surface, thus burying a total of 2,332 A. Four loop regions, which contain many of the variable residues observed between different NGF-related molecules, may determine the different receptor specificities. A clustering of positively charged side chains may provide a complementary interaction with the acidic low-affinity NGF receptor. The structure provides a model for rational design of analogues of NGF and its relatives and for testing the NGF-receptor recognition determinants critical for signal transduction.
Words, grammar, and phonology are linguistically distinct, yet their neural substrates are difficult to distinguish in macroscopic brain regions. We investigated whether they can be separated in time and space at the circuit level using intracranial electrophysiology (ICE), namely by recording local field potentials from populations of neurons using electrodes implanted in language-related brain regions while people read words verbatim or grammatically inflected them (present/past or singular/plural). Neighboring probes within Broca's area revealed distinct neuronal activity for lexical (approximately 200 milliseconds), grammatical (approximately 320 milliseconds), and phonological (approximately 450 milliseconds) processing, identically for nouns and verbs, in a region activated in the same patients and task in functional magnetic resonance imaging. This suggests that a linguistic processing sequence predicted on computational grounds is implemented in the brain in fine-grained spatiotemporally patterned activity.
Motoneurons innervating the skeletal musculature were among the first neurons shown to require the presence of their target cells to develop appropriately. But the characterization of molecules allowing motoneuron survival has been difficult. Ciliary neurotrophic factor prevents the death of motoneurons, but its gene is not expressed during development. Although the presence of a neurotrophin receptor on developing motoneurons has suggested a role for neurotrophins, none could be shown to promote motoneuron survival in vitro. We report here that brain-derived neurotrophic factor can prevent the death of axotomized motoneurons in newborn rats, suggesting a role for this neurotrophin for motoneuron survival in vivo.
The in vivo potential of neural stem cells in the postnatal mouse brain is not known, but because they produce many different types of neurons, they must be either very versatile or very diverse. By specifically targeting stem cells and following their progeny in vivo, we showed that postnatal stem cells in different regions produce different types of neurons, even when heterotopically grafted or grown in culture. This suggests that rather than being plastic and homogeneous, neural stem cells are a restricted and diverse population of progenitors.
Intraperitoneal injection of neuropathogenic strains of lactic dehydrogenase virus (LDV) causes a histologically distinctive fatal paralytic disease characterized by an inflammatory destruction of motor neurones in the brain stem and cord in C58 mice aged over 9 months. To elicit the disease in the naturally susceptible C58 strain requires an age-associated or X-ray induced loss of immunological competence, LDV infection and genetic susceptibility. Genetic studies of the common inbred mouse strains showed that susceptibility to the disease was not linked to the major histocompatibility complex but correlated with the FV-1n allele, susceptibility to spontaneous leukaemia, and infection by neuropathogenic strains of LDV. These observations suggested that neuropathogenic strains of LDV elicit the disease only in those strains of mice that carry multiple copies of N-tropic C-type retroviruses in their genomes and that are permissive for retrovirus replication. Presumably the expression of these viral genomes (high titres of virus in tissues correlating with age) is the important factor. Here we present genetic evidence to support this hypothesis and briefly discuss the possible implications.
Transplants of embryonic substantia nigra reinnervated the striatum and were able to sustain intracranial self-stimulation in rats with brain lesions induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. Dopaminergic drugs and alterations in current intensity produced typical changes in response rates. Animals with electrodes implanted into cortical grafts or into the denervated striatum failed to exhibit self-stimulation. These findings suggest that transplanted dopamine neurons convey specific, temporally organized information axonally to the striatum.
Two parallel studies using positron emission tomography, one conducted in neurological patients with brain lesions, the other in normal individuals, indicate that the normal process of retrieving words that denote concrete entities depends in part on multiple regions of the left cerebral hemisphere, located outside the classic language areas. Moreover, anatomically separable regions tends to process words for distinct kinds of items.
alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) is the most abundant gene transcript present in early active multiple sclerosis lesions, whereas such transcripts are absent in normal brain tissue. This crystallin has anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective functions. CRYAB is the major target of CD4+ T-cell immunity to the myelin sheath from multiple sclerosis brain. The pathophysiological implications of this immune response were investigated here. We demonstrate that CRYAB is a potent negative regulator acting as a brake on several inflammatory pathways in both the immune system and central nervous system (CNS). Cryab-/- mice showed worse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) at the acute and progressive phases, with higher Th1 and Th17 cytokine secretion from T cells and macrophages, and more intense CNS inflammation, compared with their wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, Cryab-/- astrocytes showed more cleaved caspase-3 and more TUNEL staining, indicating an anti-apoptotic function of Cryab. Antibody to CRYAB was detected in cerebrospinal fluid from multiple sclerosis patients and in sera from mice with EAE. Administration of recombinant CRYAB ameliorated EAE. Thus, the immune response against a negative regulator of inflammation, CRYAB, in multiple sclerosis, would exacerbate inflammation and demyelination. This can be countered by giving CRYAB itself for therapy of ongoing disease.
Neurotransmitter receptors are usually restricted to neuronal cells, but the signaling pathways activated by these receptors are widely distributed in both neural and non-neural cells. The functional consequences of activating a brain-specific neurotransmitter receptor, the serotonin 5HT1c receptor, in the unnatural environment of a fibroblast were examined. Introduction of functional 5HT1c receptors into NIH 3T3 cells results, at high frequency, in the generation of transformed foci. Moreover, the generation and maintenance of transformed foci requires continued activation of the serotonin receptor. In addition, the injection of cells derived from transformed foci into nude mice results in the generation of tumors. The serotonin 5HT1c receptor therefore functions as a protooncogene when expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.
Phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol, collectively referred to as phosphoinositides, occur in the cytoplasmic leaflet of cellular membranes and regulate activities such as vesicle transport, cytoskeletal reorganization and signal transduction. Recent studies have indicated an important role for phosphoinositide metabolism in the aetiology of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, myopathy and inflammation. Although the biological functions of the phosphatases that regulate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)) have been well characterized, little is known about the functions of the phosphatases regulating the closely related molecule phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P(2)). Here we show that inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 4A (INPP4A), a PtdIns(3,4)P(2) phosphatase, is a suppressor of glutamate excitotoxicity in the central nervous system. Targeted disruption of the Inpp4a gene in mice leads to neurodegeneration in the striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia that has a central role in motor and cognitive behaviours. Notably, Inpp4a(-/-) mice show severe involuntary movement disorders. In vitro, Inpp4a gene silencing via short hairpin RNA renders cultured primary striatal neurons vulnerable to cell death mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Mechanistically, INPP4A is found at the postsynaptic density and regulates synaptic NMDAR localization and NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current. Thus, INPP4A protects neurons from excitotoxic cell death and thereby maintains the functional integrity of the brain. Our study demonstrates that PtdIns(3,4)P(2), PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and the phosphatases acting on them can have distinct regulatory roles, and provides insight into the unique aspects and physiological significance of PtdIns(3,4)P(2) metabolism. INPP4A represents, to our knowledge, the first signalling protein with a function in neurons to suppress excitotoxic cell death. The discovery of a direct link between PtdIns(3,4)P(2) metabolism and the regulation of neurodegeneration and involuntary movements may aid the development of new approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
Dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area regulate movement and affective behavior and degenerate in Parkinson's disease. The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 was shown to be expressed in developing dopamine neurons before the appearance of known phenotypic markers for these cells. Mice lacking Nurr1 failed to generate midbrain dopaminergic neurons, were hypoactive, and died soon after birth. Nurr1 expression continued into adulthood, and brains of heterozygous animals, otherwise apparently healthy, contained reduced dopamine levels. These results suggest that putative Nurr1 ligands may be useful for treatment of Parkinson's disease and other disorders of midbrain dopamine circuitry.
In order to determine if brain tissue grafts can provide functional input to recipient central nervous system tissue, fetal rat dopamine-containg neurons were implanted adjacent to the caudate nucleus of adult recipients whose endogenous dopaminergic input had been destroyed. The grafts showed good survival and axonal outgrowth. Motor abnormalities, which had been induced by the destruction of the endogenous dopaminergic input to the caudate, were significantly reduced after grafting of the fetal brain tissue. These data suggest that such implants may be potentially useful in reversing deficits after circumscribed destruction of brain tissue.
As previously shown in the hippocampus and other brain areas, patterns of firing-rate correlations between neurons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex during a repetitive sequence task were preserved during subsequent sleep, suggesting that waking patterns are reactivated. We found that, during sleep, reactivation of spatiotemporal patterns was coherent across the network and compressed in time by a factor of 6 to 7. Thus, when behavioral constraints are removed, the brain's intrinsic processing speed may be much faster than it is in real time. Given recent evidence implicating the medial prefrontal cortex in retrieval of long-term memories, the observed replay may play a role in the process of memory consolidation.
A large proportion of right-hemisphere stroke patients show hemispatial neglect-a neurological deficit of perception, attention, representation, and/or performing actions within their left-sided space, inducing many functional debilitating effects on everyday life, and responsible for poor functional recovery and ability to benefit from treatment. The frequent parietal locus of the lesion producing neglect reflects the impairment of coordinate transformation used by the nervous system to represent extrapersonal space. Given that adaptation to a visual distortion can provide an efficient way to stimulate neural structures responsible for the transformation of sensorimotor coordinates, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of prism adaptation on various neglect symptoms, including the pathological shift of the subjective midline to the right. All patients exposed to the optical shift of the visual field to the right were improved on their manual body-midline demonstration and on classical neuropsychological tests. Unlike other physiological manipulations used to improve neglect, this improvement lasted for at least two hours after prism removal and thus could be useful in rehabilitation programmes. The positive effect found for both sensorimotor and more cognitive spatial functions suggests that they share or depend on a common level of space representation linked to multisensory integration.
Single unit activity was recorded from the frontal eye fields (area 8) in unanesthetized monkeys seated in a primate chair with the head restrained. The frontal eye field units were identified by antidromic response to stimulation of the cerebral peduncle. The findings indicate that most of the neurons discharge only after initiation of eye movements. These cells showed steady discharge when the eyes were immobile and oriented in a specific direction.
Current views of the visual system assume that the primate brain analyses form and motion along largely independent pathways; they provide no insight into why form is sometimes interpreted as motion. In a series of psychophysical and electrophysiological experiments in humans and macaques, here we show that some form information is processed in the prototypical motion areas of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). First, we show that STS cells respond to dynamic Glass patterns, which contain no coherent motion but suggest a path of motion. Second, we show that when motion signals conflict with form signals suggesting a different path of motion, both humans and monkeys perceive motion in a compromised direction. This compromise also has a correlate in the responses of STS cells, which alter their direction preferences in the presence of conflicting implied motion information. We conclude that cells in the prototypical motion areas in the dorsal visual cortex process form that implies motion. Estimating motion by combining motion cues with form cues may be a strategy to deal with the complexities of motion perception in our natural environment.
A brain-wide distributed network orchestrates cognitive memorizing and remembering of explicit memory (i.e., memory of facts and events). The network was initially identified in humans and is being systematically investigated in molecular/genetic, single-unit, lesion, and imaging studies in animals. The types of memory identified in humans are extended into animals as episodic-like (event) memory or semantic-like (fact) memory. The unique configurational association between environmental stimuli and behavioral context, which is likely the basis of episodic-like memory, depends on neural circuits in the medial temporal lobe, whereas memory traces representing repeated associations, which is likely the basis of semantic-like memory, are consolidated in the domain-specific regions in the temporal cortex. These regions are reactivated during remembering and contribute to the contents of a memory. Two types of retrieval signal reach the cortical representations. One runs from the frontal cortex for active (or effortful) retrieval (top-down signal), and the other spreads backward from the medial temporal lobe for automatic retrieval. By sending the top-down signal to the temporal cortex, frontal regions manipulate and organize to-be-remembered information, devise strategies for retrieval, and also monitor the outcome, with dissociated frontal regions making functionally separate contributions. The challenge is to understand the hierarchical interactions between these multiple cortical areas, not only with a correlational analysis but also with an interventional study demonstrating the causal necessity and the direction of the causality.
Individual hypothalamic nuclei were microdissected from brain tissue of ten human subjects who had died suddenly while in apparent good health. Appreciable amounts of vasopressin and oxytocin immunoreactivity were found by specific radioimmunoassay in six hypothalamic nuclei including supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Vasopressin and oxytocin are presumed to be synthesized in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei for axonal transport to the posterior pituitary for storage and release. Vasopressin and oxytocin in other hypothalamic nuclei may be a part of this system of neurosecretion or may serve some other function.
Numerous peptides appear to be neurotransmitter candidates in the brain. Some, such as the opioid peptide enkephalins, neurotensin, and substance P, were first isolaterd from the brain. Peptides, such as cholecystokinin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, were known as intestinal hormones and later recognized as brain constituents. Certain hypothalamic-releasing hormones, pituitary peptides, and blood-derived peptides like angiotensin II and bradykinin, may also be central neurotransmitters. The diversity of localization of these peptides throughout the brain implies a multiplicity of potential roles.
A pair of pentapeptides, Met- and Leu-enkephalin were recently isolated from brain tissue. The two peptides seem to represent endogenous opiate receptor ligands and have by immunocytochemical and radioimmunoassay studies been shown to occur in an extensive system of cerebral and peripheral nerves. The relative proportions between Met- and Leu-enkephalin varies between different brain regions and also between different species, suggesting the existence of separate populations of Met- and Leu-enkephalin nerves. Until now, however, immunocytochemistry has given no support for this notion. We report here evidence of separate populations of Met- and Leu-enkephalin nerves.
Long-term treatment of rats with clinically effective tricyclic antidepressant drugs induced a selective increase in the inhibitory response of forebrain neurons to serotonin applied by microiontophoresis. Long-term administration of some related drugs which lack antidepressant efficacy failed to induce such a change. The enhanced response to serotonin induced by the clinically active tricyclic drugs took 1 to 2 weeks to develop, a time course which correlates with the delayed onset of therapeutic effects in humans.
Postsynaptic Ca2+ elevation during synaptic transmission is an important trigger for short- and long-term changes in synaptic strength in the vertebrate central nervous system. The AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate) receptors, a subfamily of glutamate receptors, mediate much of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain and spinal cord. It has been shown that a subtype of the AMPA receptor is Ca2+-permeable and is present in the subpopulations of neurons. When synaptically localized, these receptors should mediate postsynaptic Ca2+ influx, providing a trigger for changes in synaptic strength. Here we show that Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors are synaptically localized on a subpopulation of dorsal horn neurons, and that they provide a synaptically gated route of Ca2+ entry, and that activation of these receptors strengthens synaptic transmission mediated by AMPA receptors. This pathway for postsynaptic Ca2+ influx may provide a new form of activity-dependent modulation of synaptic strength.
Haemoglobins and myoglobins constitute related protein families that function in oxygen transport and storage in humans and other vertebrates. Here we report the identification of a third globin type in man and mouse. This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, and therefore we have called it neuroglobin. Mouse neuroglobin is a monomer with a high oxygen affinity (half saturation pressure, P50 approximately 2 torr). Analogous to myoglobin, neuroglobin may increase the availability of oxygen to brain tissue. The human neuroglobin gene (NGB), located on chromosome 14q24, has a unique exon-intron structure. Neuroglobin represents a distinct protein family that diverged early in metazoan evolution, probably before the Protostomia/Deuterostomia split.
The united efforts of assemblies of neurons in the brain's primary visual cortex translate incoming visual signals into action potentials. These action potentials encode, for example, the contrast and orientation of different parts of the image. Some neurons are sensitive to one particular orientation, other are sensitive to other orientations, but all neurons respond equally well to the image contrast. In a Perspective, Volgushev and Eysel explain the finding (Anderson et al.) that neurons are able to maintain this sensitivity to the orientation of a stimulus regardless of the contrast by adding noise to the membrane potential, such that action potentials can also be generated in response to weak signals at low contrast.
The main route of information flow in the cerebral cortex is from the middle layers of cortex to upper and lower layers. However, upper layers of the cat primary visual cortex can be directly driven by inputs from secondary visual cortex when activity in middle layers is disrupted. Upper-layer activity can be driven either by middle layers or by direct corticocortical inputs. One consequence of this result is that areas of cortex thought to be carrying out low-order analysis may be able to extract considerable information from higher order areas.
Postsynaptic differentiation of dendrites is an essential step in synapse formation. We report here a requirement for the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) in the morphogenesis of postsynaptic granule neuron dendritic claws in the cerebellar cortex. A transcriptional repressor form of MEF2A that is sumoylated at lysine-403 promoted dendritic claw differentiation. Activity-dependent calcium signaling induced a calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of MEF2A at serine-408 and, thereby, promoted a switch from sumoylation to acetylation at lysine-403, which led to inhibition of dendritic claw differentiation. Our findings define a mechanism underlying postsynaptic differentiation that may modulate activity-dependent synapse development and plasticity in the brain.
Visual-spatial attention is an essential brain function that enables us to select and preferentially process high priority information in the visual fields. Several brain areas have been shown to participate in the control of spatial attention in humans, but little is known about the underlying selection mechanisms. Non-invasive scalp recordings of event-related potentials (e.r.ps) in humans have shown that attended visual stimuli are preferentially selected as early as 80-90 ms after stimulus onset, but current e.r.p. methods do not permit a precise localization of the participating cortical areas. In this study we combined neuroimaging (positron emission tomography) with e.r.p. recording in order to describe both the cortical anatomy and time course of attentional selection processes. Together these methods showed that visual inputs from attended locations receive enhanced processing in the extrastriate cortex (fusiform gyrus) at 80-130 ms after stimulus onset. These findings reinforce early selection models of attention.
The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is found in mammalian brain and at high concentrations in the bag cell neurons of Aplysia. We show here that insulin causes an acute rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in these neurons and triggers release of neuropeptide. The insulin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool differs pharmacologically from previously described Ca2+ stores that are sensitive to inositol trisphosphate and from mitochondrial Ca2+ stores. Insulin, but not thapsigargin, stimulates Ca2+ release at the distal tips of neurites, the presumed site of neuropeptide secretion. The effects of insulin on intracellular Ca2+ release and neuropeptide secretion occur without triggering spontaneous action potentials. The insulin-sensitive rise in [Ca2+]i moves into the distal tips of neurites after exposure to a cyclic AMP analogue, a treatment that causes a similar translocation of neuronal vesicles. Our data indicate that Ca2+ release from a distinct intracellular pool associated with secretory vesicles may contribute to secretion of neuropeptide in the absence of neuronal discharge.
The synergistic response of cells to the stimulation of multiple receptors has been ascribed to receptor cross talk; however, the specific molecules that mediate the resultant signal amplification have not been defined. Here a 24-kilodalton single transmembrane protein, designated calcyon, we functionally characterize that interacts with the D1 dopamine receptor. Calcyon localizes to dendritic spines of D1 receptor-expressing pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex. These studies delineate a mechanism of Gq- and Gs-coupled heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein-coupled receptor cross talk by which D1 receptors can shift effector coupling to stimulate robust intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) release as a result of interaction with calcyon. The role of calcyon in potentiating Ca2+-dependent signaling should provide insight into the D1 receptor-modulated cognitive functions of prefrontal cortex.
The rich and immediate perception of a familiar face, including its identity, expression and even intent, is one of the most impressive shared faculties of human and non-human primate brains. Many visually responsive neurons in the inferotemporal cortex of macaque monkeys respond selectively to faces, sometimes to only one or a few individuals, while showing little sensitivity to scale and other details of the retinal image. Here we show that face-responsive neurons in the macaque monkey anterior inferotemporal cortex are tuned to a fundamental dimension of face perception. Using a norm-based caricaturization framework previously developed for human psychophysics, we varied the identity information present in photo-realistic human faces, and found that neurons of the anterior inferotemporal cortex were most often tuned around the average, identity-ambiguous face. These observations are consistent with face-selective responses in this area being shaped by a figural comparison, reflecting structural differences between an incoming face and an internal reference or norm. As such, these findings link the tuning of neurons in the inferotemporal cortex to psychological models of face identity perception.
Perfusion of two isolated brains from immature male rhesus monkeys with [(3)H]androstenedione resulted in the identification of free and conjugated [(3)H]estrone and free [(3)H]estradiol from the perfusates. In the dissected cerebral tissues, estrogens were recovered only from the hypothalamus and limbic system. The production of estrogens from androstenedione during the 40-minute perfusions in these two experiments totaled 1.58 and 2.83 nanograms.
Lurcher (Lc) is a spontaneous, semidominant mouse neurological mutation. Heterozygous Lurcher mice (Lc/+) display ataxia as a result of a selective, cell-autonomous and apoptotic death of cerebellar Purkinje cells during postnatal development. Homozygous Lurcher mice (Lc/Lc) die shortly after birth because of a massive loss of mid- and hindbrain neurons during late embryogenesis. We have used positional cloning to identify the mutations responsible for neurodegeneration in two independent Lc alleles as G-to-A transitions that change a highly conserved alanine to a threonine residue in transmembrane domain III of the mouse delta2 glutamate receptor gene (GluR delta2). Lc/+ Purkinje cells have a very high membrane conductance and a depolarized resting potential, indicating the presence of a large, constitutive inward current. Expression of the mutant GluR delta2(Lc) protein in Xenopus oocytes confirmed these results, demonstrating that Lc is inherited as a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from a gain-of-function mutation in a glutamate receptor gene. Thus the activation of apoptotic neuronal death in Lurcher mice may provide a physiologically relevant model for excitotoxic cell death.
The glycosphingolipid (GSL) lysosomal storage diseases result from the inheritance of defects in the genes encoding the enzymes required for catabolism of GSLs within lysosomes. A strategy for the treatment of these diseases, based on an inhibitor of GSL biosynthesis N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, was evaluated in a mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease. When Tay-Sachs mice were treated with N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, the accumulation of GM2 in the brain was prevented, with the number of storage neurons and the quantity of ganglioside stored per cell markedly reduced. Thus, limiting the biosynthesis of the substrate (GM2) for the defective enzyme (beta-hexosaminidase A) prevents GSL accumulation and the neuropathology associated with its lysosomal storage.
There is little axonal growth after central nervous system (CNS) injury in adult mammals. The administration of antibodies (IN-1) to neutralize the myelin-associated neurite growth inhibitory proteins leads to long-distance regrowth of a proportion of CNS axons after injury. Our aim was: to determine if spinal cord lesion in adult rats, followed by treatment with antibodies to neurite growth inhibitors, can lead to regeneration and anatomical plasticity of other spinally projecting pathways; to determine if the anatomical projections persist at long survival intervals; and to determine whether this fibre growth is associated with recovery of function. We report here that brain stem-spinal as well as corticospinal axons undergo regeneration and anatomical plasticity after application of IN-1 antibodies. There is a recovery of specific reflex and locomotor functions after spinal cord injury in these adult rats. Removal of the sensorimotor cortex in IN-1-treated rats 2-3 months later abolished the recovered contact-placing responses, suggesting that the recovery was dependent upon the regrowth of these pathways.
In the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, a massive retial complex is interposed between the systemic and cerebral circulations at the cervicothoracic level. Pressure measurements in the retial efferent arteries supplying the brain revealed relatively nonpulsatile pressure profiles. These measurements in the anesthetized dolphin demonstrate the pressure-damping effect of the retia mirabile.
In order to obtain information on the possible functions of endogenous opiates in the primate cerebral cortex, we assessed the distribution of mu-like opiate receptors (which selectively bind 3H-labeled naloxone) and delta-like opiate receptors (which selectively bind 3H-labeled D-Ala2, D-Leu5-enkephalin) throughout the cerebral cortex of the rhesus monkey. Stereospecific [3H]naloxone binding sites increased in a gradient along hierarchically organized cortical systems that sequentially process modality-specific sensory information of a progressively more complex nature. Specific [3H]enkephalin binding sites, in contrast, were relatively evenly distributed throughout the cerebral cortex. These results, in combination with electrophysiological studies of monkeys and humans, suggest that mu-like opiate receptors may play a role in the affective filtering of sensory stimuli at the cortical level, that is, in emotion-induced selective attention.
Many voluntary movements involve coordination between the limbs. However, there have been very few attempts to study the neuronal mechanisms that mediate this coordination. Here we have studied the activity of cortical neurons while monkeys performed tasks that required coordination between the two arms. We found that most neurons in the primary motor cortex (MI) show activity specific to bimanual movements (bimanual-related activity), which is strikingly different from the activity of the same neurons during unimanual movements. Moreover, units in the supplementary motor area (SMA; the area of cortex most often associated with bimanual coordination) showed no more bimanual-related activity than units in MI. Our results challenge the classic view that MI controls the contralateral (opposite) side of the body and that SMA is responsible for the coordination of the arms. Rather, our data suggest that both cortical areas share the control of bilateral coordination.
Little is known about the pathophysiology of cerebral edema and other disturbances of water balance that involve the barrier tissues at the interface of blood and brain. The present experiments show that these barrier tissues contain receptors and second messenger systems for atriopeptins, recently identified cardiac peptides involved in peripheral water regulation. They also show that atriopeptins can alter the rate of cerebrospinal fluid production. Because the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers are involved in normal water movements in the central nervous system, these studies suggest that brain barrier tissues may be important end organs for the atriopeptins and that atriopeptins could have therapeutic application to disorders of water balance in the central nervous system. An isolated, purified population of atriopeptin receptor cells, obtained from choroid epithelium, was used in these experiments. This cell population may provide a valuable model system for investigating the intracellular biochemical mechanisms through which atriopeptins exert their actions.
An ongoing controversy concerns the cellular distribution of the differentially spliced forms of the amyloid protein precursor (APP) mRNAs and changes in prevalence of these transcripts during Alzheimer's disease. In situ hybridization on serial sections was used to prove that most hippocampal pyramidal neurons contain both APP-751 and APP-695 mRNA species. The APP-751/APP-695 mRNA ratio is generally increased during Alzheimer's disease, as shown by RNA gel blot analysis. Moreover, there was a strong linear relation between the increase in APP-751/APP-695 mRNA ratio in pyramidal neurons and the density of senile plaques within the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Thus, the increase in APP-751/APP-695 mRNA provides a molecular marker for regional variations in plaque density between individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by the commonly used composite criteria.
The inferior temporal cortex (IT) of primates is thought to be the final visual area in the ventral stream of cortical areas responsible for object recognition. Consistent with this hypothesis, single IT neurons respond selectively to highly complex visual stimuli such as faces. However, a direct causal link between the activity of face-selective neurons and face perception has not been demonstrated. In the present study of macaque monkeys, we artificially activated small clusters of IT neurons by means of electrical microstimulation while the monkeys performed a categorization task, judging whether noisy visual images belonged to 'face' or 'non-face' categories. Here we show that microstimulation of face-selective sites, but not other sites, strongly biased the monkeys' decisions towards the face category. The magnitude of the effect depended upon the degree of face selectivity of the stimulation site, the size of the stimulated cluster of face-selective neurons, and the exact timing of microstimulation. Our results establish a causal relationship between the activity of face-selective neurons and face perception.
A monoclonal antibody was prepared against pooled homogenates of brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease. This antibody recognizes an antigen present in much higher concentration in certain brain regions of Alzheimer patients than in normal brain. The antigen appears to be a protein present in neurons involved in the formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and in some morphologically normal neurons in sections from Alzheimer brains. Partial purification and Western blot analysis revealed the antigen from Alzheimer brain to be a single protein with a molecular weight of 68,000. Application of the same purification procedure to normal brain tissue results in the detection of small amounts of a protein of lower molecular weight.
Presynaptic calcium channels are crucial elements of neuronal excitation-secretion coupling. In mammalian brain, they have been difficult to characterize because most presynaptic terminals are too small to probe with electrodes, and available pharmacological tools such as dihydropyridines and omega-conotoxin are largely ineffective. Subsecond measurements of synaptosomal glutamate release have now been used to assess presynaptic calcium channel activity in order to study the action of peptide toxins from the venom of the funnel web spider Agelenopsis aperta, which is known to inhibit dihydropyridine and omega-conotoxin-resistant neuronal calcium currents. A presynaptic calcium channel important in glutamate release is shown to be omega-Aga-IVA sensitive and omega-conotoxin resistant.
Primary or nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) is a heterogeneous condition in which affected patients do not have any distinctive clinical or biochemical features in common apart from cognitive impairment. Although it is present in approximately 0.15-0.3% of males, most of the genetic defects associated with MRX, which may involve more than ten different genes, remain unknown. Here we report the characterization of a new gene on the long arm of the X-chromosome (position Xq12) and the identification in unrelated individuals of different mutations that are predicted to cause a loss of function. This gene is highly expressed in fetal brain and encodes a protein of relative molecular mass 91K, named oligophrenin-1, which contains a domain typical of a Rho-GTPase-activating protein (rhoGAP). By enhancing their GTPase activity, GAP proteins inactivate small Rho and Ras proteins, so inactivation of rhoGAP proteins might cause constitutive activation of their GTPase targets. Such activation is known to affect cell migration and outgrowth of axons and dendrites in vivo. Our results demonstrate an association between cognitive impairment and a defect in a signalling pathway that depends on a Ras-like GTPase.
Working memory is responsible for the short-term storage and online manipulation of information necessary for higher cognitive functions, such as language, planning and problem-solving. Traditionally, working memory has been divided into two types of processes: executive control (governing the encoding manipulation and retrieval of information in working memory) and active maintenance (keeping information available 'online'). It has also been proposed that these two types of processes may be subserved by distinct cortical structures, with the prefrontal cortex housing the executive control processes, and more posterior regions housing the content-specific buffers (for example verbal versus visuospatial) responsible for active maintenance. However, studies in non-human primates suggest that dorsolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex may also be involved in active maintenance. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activation in human subjects during performance of a working memory task. We used the temporal resolution of this technique to examine the dynamics of regional activation, and to show that prefrontal cortex along with parietal cortex appears to play a role in active maintenance.
In rats after portacaval anastomosis (an animal model of chronic liver disease), transport of tryptophan and other members of the large neutral amino acid group from blood to brain was markedly enhanced. Increased transport activity was apparently restricted to the neutral amino acid transport system, since brain uptake of glucose, inulin, and tyramine was unaffected while blood-brain arginine transport was significantly reduced. These results strikingly confirm the hypothesis that carrier-mediated blood-brain transport is the limiting factor determining the availability of the neutral amino acids to the brain. The encephalopathy associated with cirrhosis may be the result of abnormal neurotransmitter metabolism and neurotransmission secondary to increased neutral amino acid  transport activity and an increased brain content of members of the neutral amino acid group.
The oscillation of membrane potential in mammalian central neurons is of interest because it relates to the role of oscillations in brain function. It has been proposed that the entorhinal cortex (EC), particularly the stellate cells of layer II (ECIIscs), plays an important part in the genesis of the theta rhythm. These neurons occupy a key position in the neocortex-hippocampus-neocortex circuit, a crucial crossroad in memory functions. Neuronal oscillations typically rely on the activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ conductances and the Ca2+ -dependent K+ conductance that usually follows, as seen in other limbic subcortical structures generating theta rhythmicity. Here we report, however, that similar oscillations are generated in ECIIscs by a Na+ conductance. The finding of a subthreshold, voltage-gated, Na+ -dependent rhythmic membrane oscillation in mammalian neurons indicates that rhythmicity in heterogeneous neuronal networks may be supported by different sets of intrinsic ionic mechanisms in each of the neuronal elements involved.
Recent functional brain imaging studies in humans indicate that learning and memory involve many of the same regions of the cortex that process sensory information and control motor output. The forms of perceptual and motor learning that can occur without conscious recollection are mediated in part by contractions and expansions of representations in the sensory and motor cortex. The same regions are also engaged during the conscious storage and retrieval of facts and events, but these types of memory also bring into play structures involved in the active maintenance of memories "on line" and in the establishment of associative links between the information stored in different sensory areas. Although the picture of memory that is emerging from functional imaging studies is consistent with current physiological accounts, there are puzzles and surprises that will be solved only through a combination of human and animal studies.
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) and its neuron-specific activator p35 are required for neurite outgrowth and cortical lamination. Proteolytic cleavage of p35 produces p25, which accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conversion of p35 to p25 causes prolonged activation and mislocalization of cdk5. Consequently, the p25/cdk5 kinase hyperphosphorylates tau, disrupts the cytoskeleton and promotes the death (apoptosis) of primary neurons. Here we describe the mechanism of conversion of p35 to p25. In cultured primary cortical neurons, excitotoxins, hypoxic stress and calcium influx induce the production of p25. In fresh brain lysates, addition of calcium can stimulate cleavage of p35 to p25. Specific inhibitors of calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease, effectively inhibit the calcium-induced cleavage of p35. In vitro, calpain directly cleaves p35 to release a fragment with relative molecular mass 25,000. The sequence of the calpain cleavage product corresponds precisely to that of p25. Application of the amyloid beta-peptide A beta(1-42) induces the conversion of p35 to p25 in primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, inhibition of cdk5 or calpain activity reduces cell death in A beta-treated cortical neurons. These observations indicate that cleavage of p35 to p25 by calpain may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
When we see a person's face, we can easily recognize their species, individual identity and emotional state. How does the brain represent such complex information? A substantial number of neurons in the macaque temporal cortex respond to faces. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the processing of complex information are not yet clear. Here we recorded the activity of single neurons in the temporal cortex of macaque monkeys while presenting visual stimuli consisting of geometric shapes, and monkey and human faces with various expressions. Information theory was used to investigate how well the neuronal responses could categorize the stimuli. We found that single neurons conveyed two different scales of facial information in their firing patterns, starting at different latencies. Global information, categorizing stimuli as monkey faces, human faces or shapes, was conveyed in the earliest part of the responses. Fine information about identity or expression was conveyed later, beginning on average 51 ms after global information. We speculate that global information could be used as a 'header' to prepare destination areas for receiving more detailed information.
Ensemble neuronal activity was recorded in each layer of the whisker area of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) while rats performed a whisker-dependent tactile discrimination task. Comparison of this activity with SI activity evoked by similar passive whisker stimulation revealed fundamental differences in tactile signal processing during active and passive stimulation. Moreover, significant layer-specific functional differences in SI activity were observed during active discrimination. These differences could not be explained solely by variations in ascending thalamocortical input to SI. Instead, these results suggest that top-down influences during active discrimination may alter the overall functional nature of SI as well as layer-specific mechanisms of tactile processing.
Transcortical polarization of one cerebral hemisphere, while producing the well-known changes in the amplitude of the evoked potentials in the ipsilateral cortex, induced opposite behavior of these indicators in the contralateral cortex. With the corpus callosum sectioned, the reciprocal relationship was enhanced. Anesthetic doses of barbiturates not only eliminated reciprocity but made the potentials on both sides react in unison to unilateral polarization. These findings suggest the existence of a negative feedback system between the cerebral cortex and the subcortex and the existence of a "left-right equalizing" mechanism carried by pathways in the corpus callosum.
Despite its implications for higher order functions of the brain, little is currently known about the molecular basis of left-right asymmetry of the brain. Here we report that synaptic distribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor GluRepsilon2 (NR2B) subunits in the adult mouse hippocampus is asymmetrical between the left and right and between the apical and basal dendrites of single neurons. These asymmetrical allocations of epsilon2 subunits differentiate the properties of NMDA receptors and synaptic plasticity between the left and right hippocampus. These results provide a molecular basis for the structural and functional asymmetry of the mature brain.
Neural-network oscillations at distinct frequencies have been implicated in the encoding, consolidation and retrieval of information in the hippocampus. Some GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-containing interneurons fire phase-locked to theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) or to sharp-wave-associated ripple oscillations (120-200 Hz), which represent different behavioural states. Interneurons also entrain pyramidal cells in vitro. The large diversity of interneurons poses the question of whether they have specific roles in shaping distinct network activities in vivo. Here we report that three distinct interneuron types--basket, axo-axonic and oriens-lacunosum-moleculare cells--visualized and defined by synaptic connectivity as well as by neurochemical markers, contribute differentially to theta and ripple oscillations in anaesthetized rats. The firing patterns of individual cells of the same class are remarkably stereotyped and provide unique signatures for each class. We conclude that the diversity of interneurons, innervating distinct domains of pyramidal cells, emerged to coordinate the activity of pyramidal cells in a temporally distinct and brain-state-dependent manner.
Evidence points to the existence of multiple classes of dopamine (DA) receptor in mammalian brain which can be distinguished by their pharmacological specificities and localizations, and by the actions they mediate. Among them, dopaminergic autoreceptors are regulatory receptors presumed to be present in the membrane of the DA neurones themselves, and believed to mediate an inhibition of these neurones' activity, either at nerve endings or on cell bodies. However, the pharmacology of autoreceptors remains to be established because attempts to characterize autoreceptors by 3H-ligand binding techniques have produced controversial data. Thus Seeman and co-workers stated that 3H-apomorphine selectively labels autoreceptors, whereas Creese et al. concluded that this ligand selectively labels postsynaptic DA receptors. In addition, large differences in the capacity and drug specificity of 3H-apomorphine receptor sites in rat striatum have been reported. We demonstrate here that 3H-apomorphine labels two classes of DA receptor, distinguishable using domperidone, a selective DA antagonist. Lesion studies indicate that they correspond to a certain class of postsynaptic receptor and to autoreceptors, respectively. Each of these classes displays a clearly distinct pharmacological specificity for antipsychotics and DA agonists.
Encoding of information in the cortex is thought to depend on synchronous firing of cortical neurons. Inhibitory neurons are known to be critical in the coordination of cortical activity, but how interaction among inhibitory cells promotes synchrony is not well understood. To address this issue directly, we have recorded simultaneously from pairs of fast-spiking (FS) cells, a type of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neocortical interneuron. Here we report a high occurrence of electrical coupling among FS cells. Electrical synapses were not found among pyramidal neurons or between FS cells and other cortical cells. Some FS cells were interconnected by both electrical and GABAergic synapses. We show that communication through electrical synapses allows excitatory signalling among inhibitory cells and promotes their synchronous spiking. These results indicate that electrical synapses establish a network of fast-spiking cells in the neocortex which may play a key role in coordinating cortical activity.
Phosphatidate, a neuronal phospholipid, stimulated the uptake of calcium by nerve terminals isolated from the striatum of rat brain. This effect was not produced by other phospholipids or glycolipids. Phosphatidate, but not other phospholipids, evoked the release of [3H] dopamine from striatal synaptosomes. The magnitude of both effects was similar to that observed after chemical depolarization of the nerve terminals. These results show that phosphatidate is the only membrane lipid component that acts as a functionally competent ionophore and support the suggestion that phosphatidate may serve as a link between depolarization and neurotransmitter release in the brain.
When the concentration of calcium ions in the cerebral ventricles is elevated, a fully satiated rat eats voraciously. This feeding response is not prevented by prior intraventricular administration of alpha-or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, or other pharmacological antagonists. This supports the concept of an independent ionic mechanism, rather than a neurotransmitter one, for modulating a "set-point" for weight or hunger.
Antischizophrenic neuroleptic drugs interact with brain dopamine systems in producing both therapeutic and unwanted side effects. Short-term administration of neuroleptics may produce a parkinsonian, hypokinetic syndrome mimicking symptoms of dopamine depletion, and presumably caused by dopamine receptor blockade. Paradoxically, some 20% of patients treated chronically with these agents develop tardive dyskinesia. The adventitious movements typical of this condition mimic symptoms of dopamine excess despite continuing receptor blockade. Dopamine receptor supersensitivity does develop in such conditions, but its extent does not correlate well with the presence or absence of tardive dyskinesia. Exploration of neuroleptic-induced alterations in other dopamine-associated systems may thus provide insight into these processes. Dopamine-containing cells of the substantia nigra, prominently implicated in the motor side effects of neuroleptics, possess dense concentrations of receptors for the putative peptide neurotransmitter, neurotensin. Here we report that these receptors are substantially increased in both rats and humans after chronic treatment with neuroleptic drugs, and discuss possible implications of this finding for our understanding of neuroleptic actions.
The voluntary control of gaze implies the ability to make saccadic eye movements specified by abstract instructions, as well as the ability to repress unwanted orientating to sudden stimuli. Both of these abilities are challenged in the antisaccade task, because it requires subjects to look at an unmarked location opposite to a flashed stimulus, without glancing at it. Performance on this task depends on the frontal/prefrontal cortex and related structures, but the neuronal operations underlying antisaccades are not understood. It is not known, for example, how excited visual neurons that normally trigger a saccade to a target (a prosaccade) can activate oculomotor neurons directing gaze in the opposite direction. Visual neurons might, perhaps, alter their receptive fields depending on whether they receive a pro- or antisaccade instruction. If the receptive field is not altered, the antisaccade goal must be computed and imposed from the top down to the appropriate oculomotor neurons. Here we show, using recordings from the supplementary eye field (a frontal cortex oculomotor centre) in monkeys, that visual and movement neurons retain the same spatial selectivity across randomly mixed pro- and antisaccade trials. However, these neurons consistently fire more before antisaccades than prosaccades with the same trajectories, suggesting a mechanism through which voluntary antisaccade commands can override reflexive glances.
Many animals attract mating partners through the release of volatile sex pheromones, which can convey information on the species, gender and receptivity of the sender to induce innate courtship and mating behaviours by the receiver. Male Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies display stereotyped reproductive behaviours towards females, and these behaviours are controlled by the neural circuitry expressing male-specific isoforms of the transcription factor Fruitless (FRU(M)). However, the volatile pheromone ligands, receptors and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that promote male courtship have not been identified in this important model organism. Here we describe a novel courtship function of Ionotropic receptor 84a (IR84a), which is a member of the chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptor family, in a previously uncharacterized population of FRU(M)-positive OSNs. IR84a-expressing neurons are activated not by fly-derived chemicals but by the aromatic odours phenylacetic acid and phenylacetaldehyde, which are widely found in fruit and other plant tissues that serve as food sources and oviposition sites for drosophilid flies. Mutation of Ir84a abolishes both odour-evoked and spontaneous electrophysiological activity in these neurons and markedly reduces male courtship behaviour. Conversely, male courtship is increased--in an IR84a-dependent manner--in the presence of phenylacetic acid but not in the presence of another fruit odour that does not activate IR84a. Interneurons downstream of IR84a-expressing OSNs innervate a pheromone-processing centre in the brain. Whereas IR84a orthologues and phenylacetic-acid-responsive neurons are present in diverse drosophilid species, IR84a is absent from insects that rely on long-range sex pheromones. Our results suggest a model in which IR84a couples food presence to the activation of the fru(M) courtship circuitry in fruitflies. These findings reveal an unusual but effective evolutionary solution to coordinate feeding and oviposition site selection with reproductive behaviours through a specific sensory pathway.
Autoradiographic representation of the local rates of cerebral glucose utilization and local cerebral functional activity by means of the [14C]deoxyglucose technique reveals the existence of the ocular dominance columns in the striate cortex of the monkey in the first day of life. In contrast to the stability of these columns in more mature brain, monocular deprivation for 3 months from the first day of life results in their complete disappearance and a reversion of the autoradiographic pattern to that seen in animals with normal binocular vision. These results are consistent with a reorganization of the representation of the visual fields of the two eyes in the striate cortex and provide additional evidence of the plasticity of the striate cortex of the monkey in early life.
Traditionally, neuronal operations in the cerebral cortex have been viewed as occurring through the interaction of synaptic potentials in the dendrite and soma, followed by the initiation of an action potential, typically in the axon. Propagation of this action potential to the synaptic terminals is widely believed to be the only form of rapid communication of information between the soma and axonal synapses, and hence to postsynaptic neurons. Here we show that the voltage fluctuations associated with dendrosomatic synaptic activity propagate significant distances along the axon, and that modest changes in the somatic membrane potential of the presynaptic neuron modulate the amplitude and duration of axonal action potentials and, through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, the average amplitude of the postsynaptic potential evoked by these spikes. These results indicate that synaptic activity in the dendrite and soma controls not only the pattern of action potentials generated, but also the amplitude of the synaptic potentials that these action potentials initiate in local cortical circuits, resulting in synaptic transmission that is a mixture of triggered and graded (analogue) signals.
We have studied the properties of Cl- channels in Muller cells of the lamprey brain, which are activated by two putative neurotransmitters, glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Previous studies have shown that in these cells the two ligands act through different receptors, and it was of interest to determine whether or not the two receptors, in turn, activate separate channels having different properties. We have shown previously that the channels activated by glycine have large conductances which decrease rapidly as the intracellular Cl- concentration [Cl-]i is increased above normal. We show here that GABA-activated channels have much smaller conductances which are independent of [Cl-]i over the experimental range and also that the response to a saturating application of glycine is not occluded by simultaneous GABA application. These observations indicate that the glycine and GABA receptors are coupled to separate Cl- channels having different characteristics.
Three nuclear areas in the medulla were implicated in the control of sound production in the oyster toadfish Opsanus tau. The sonic motor nucleus was labeled by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected into swimbladder sonic muscles, and an adjacent ventrolateral and a more anterior periventricular nucleus of the medulla were revealed by autoradiography with 3H-labeled testosterone. These androgen uptake sites occur in brainstem areas corresponding to areas predicted to contain the neural centers controlling the duration and fundamental frequency of the toadfish mating call.
We tested the significance of a population of lumbar spinothalamic cells for male sexual behavior in rats. These cells are positioned to relay ejaculation-related signals from reproductive organs to the brain, and they express neurokinin-1 receptors. Ablation of these neurons by the selective toxin SSP-saporin resulted in a complete disruption of ejaculatory behavior. In contrast, other components of sexual behavior remained intact. These results suggest that this population of spinothalamic cells plays a pivotal role in generation of ejaculatory behavior and may be part of a spinal ejaculation generator.
Relative motion is one of the most salient cues for segmentation of a visual scene into separate objects. This is illustrated by the vivid contours that are perceived when random dot patterns move in different directions. Once motion is halted in such displays the segmentation contours disappear. This makes random dot patterns ideal for the study of contour from motion processing in isolation. Contour from motion processing obviously relies on direction-selective neurons, which are found in many visual cortical areas. It is, however, largely unknown at what level of processing their signals interact to serve the global process of motion-based image segmentation. To answer this question, we recorded visually evoked potentials, both in man and in awake monkey, to a stimulus specifically designed to signal the presence of neuronal activity related to contour from motion processing. We report here that response components specific to contour from motion were elicited only when the stimulus yielded a contour percept. In awake monkey, the sources of these components were located within the supra- and infra-granular layers of primary visual cortex. We conclude that V1 is involved in image segmentation processing.
The midbrain region periaqueductal grey (PAG) is rich in opioid receptors and endogenous opioids and is a major target of analgesic action in the central nervous system. It has been proposed that the analgesic effect of opioids on the PAG works by suppressing the inhibitory influence of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) on neurons that form part of a descending antinociceptive pathway. Opioids inhibit GABA-mediated (GABAergic) synaptic transmission in the PAG and other brain regions by reducing the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, but the mechanisms involved remain uncertain. Here we report that opioid inhibition of GABAergic synaptic currents in the PAG is controlled by a presynaptic voltage-dependent potassium conductance. Opioid receptors of the mu type in GABAergic presynaptic terminals are specifically coupled to this potassium conductance by a pathway involving phospholipase A2, arachidonic acid and 12-lipoxygenase. Furthermore, opioid inhibition of GABAergic synaptic transmission is potentiated by inhibitors of the enzymes cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, presumably because more arachidonic acid is available for conversion to 12-lipoxygenase products. These mechanisms account for the analgesic action of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in the PAG and their synergism with opioids.
The effects of conflicting visual images were studied without the confounding influences of oculomotor abnormalities: strabismus was simulated by rearing kittens with ophthalmic prisms before the eyes. After the animals had matured, the response properties of neurons in the visual cortex were studied. The proportion of binocularly excited neurons decreased; however, the extent of the ocular dominance alterations was related to the amount and direction of the prism-induced deviation.
Autoradiographic evidence after injection of tritiated thymidine indicates that cell position in the laminae of the monkey visual cortex is systematically related to time of cell orgin. The earliest-formed neurons, destined for the deepest stratum, arise at about embryonic day 45, and the last ones, destined for the outermost cell stratum, form at about day 102; cells of intervening layers are generated at intervening times. No neocortical neurons are produced in the last two prenatal months or after birth. Compared to cortical neurons in rodents, those in the monkey arise earlier, and the "inside-out" relation of cell position to time of origin is more rigid.
As monkeys perform schedules containing several trials with a visual cue indicating reward proximity, their error rates decrease as the number of remaining trials decreases, suggesting that their motivation and/or reward expectancy increases as the reward approaches. About one-third of single neurons recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex of monkeys during these reward schedules had responses that progressively changed strength with reward expectancy, an effect that disappeared when the cue was random. Alterations of this progression could be the basis for the changes from normal that are reported in anterior cingulate population activity for obsessive-compulsive disorder and drug abuse, conditions characterized by disturbances in reward expectancy.
The experience of pain arises from both physiological and psychological factors, including one's beliefs and expectations. Thus, placebo treatments that have no intrinsic pharmacological effects may produce analgesia by altering expectations. However, controversy exists regarding whether placebos alter sensory pain transmission, pain affect, or simply produce compliance with the suggestions of investigators. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we found that placebo analgesia was related to decreased brain activity in pain-sensitive brain regions, including the thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, and was associated with increased activity during anticipation of pain in the prefrontal cortex, providing evidence that placebos alter the experience of pain.
In accordance with its important role in prehensile activity, a large cortical area is devoted to representation of the digits. Within this large cortical zone in the macaque somatosensory cortex, the complexity of neuronal receptive field characteristics increases from area 3b to areas 1 and 2 (refs 1-7). This increase in complexity continues into the upper bank of the intraparietal sulcus, where the somatosensory cortex adjoins the parietal association cortex. In this bank, callosal connections are much denser than in the more anterior part of this cortical zone. We have now discovered a substantial number of neurons with receptive fields on the bilateral hands. It was previously thought that neuronal receptive fields were restricted to the contralateral side in this cortical zone. Neurons with bilateral receptive fields were not found after lesioning the postcentral gyrus in the contralateral hemisphere. The majority of these neurons had receptive fields of the most complex types, representing multiple digits, indicating that the interhemispheric transfer of information occurs at higher levels of the hierarchical processing in each hemisphere.
Analysis of data collected on 131 species of primates, bats, and insectivores showed that the sizes of brain components, from medulla to forebrain, are highly predictable from absolute brain size by a nonlinear function. The order of neurogenesis was found to be highly conserved across a wide range of mammals and to correlate with the relative enlargement of structures as brain size increases, with disproportionately large growth occurring in late-generated structures. Because the order of neurogenesis is conserved, the most likely brain alteration resulting from selection for any behavioral ability may be a coordinated enlargement of the entire nonolfactory brain.
Language-relevant processing of auditory signals is lateralized and involves the posterior part of Brodmann area 22. We found that the functional lateralization in this area was accompanied by interhemispheric differences in the organization of the intrinsic microcircuitry. Neuronal tract tracing revealed a modular network of long-range intrinsic connections linking regularly spaced clusters of neurons. Although the cluster diameter was similar in both hemispheres, their spacing was about 20 percent larger in the left hemisphere. Assuming similar relations between functional and anatomical architecture as in visual cortex, the present data suggest that more functionally distinct columnar systems are included per surface unit in the left than in the right area 22.
The mustache bat, Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus, emits orientation sounds containing a long constant-frequency (CF) component that is ideal for echo detection and Doppler shift measurement. About 30 percent of the primary auditory cortex of this bat is chiefly devoted to processing the second harmonic of the CF component in Doppler-shifted echoes. In this Doppler-shifted-CF processing area, single neurons recorded in any electrode penetration perpendicular to the cortical surface have nearly identical best frequencies and best amplitudes (or best pressure levels) at which the neurons show maximum excitation. The best frequency and best amplitude vary systematically with the location of the neurons in the cerebral cortex, so that there are tonotopic and "amplitopic" representation axes, which are radial and eccentric, respectively. In other words, the best-frequency and best-amplitude contours are eccentric and radial, respectively. The amplitude spectrum of a signal is thus represented in the coordinates of amplitude and frequency parallel to the cortical surface. This amplitude spectrum representation is disproportionate according to perceptual significance, so that a signal of 61.5 to 62.0 kilohertz and 30 to 50 decibels SPL (sound pressure level) is projected to a larger area than other signals. Just outside this Doppler-shifted-CF processing area, neurons are found which are specialized for responding to a particular information-bearing element or a particular combination of information-bearing elements in orientation sounds and echoes consisting of CF and frequency-modulated components.
In a study of cerebral function by electroencephalographic techniques the following observations have been made. (i) In intact subjects, repeated stimulation with bright light causes a predictable change (alpha blocking) in the electroencephalogram, whereas repeated auditory stimulation does not. (ii) If, however, an auditory stimulus is presented repeatedly just before the visual stimulus, the sound temporarily but predictably acquires the property of the light to suppress the alpha activity. (iii) This linkage between sound and light occurs much less frequently in human subjects with known amounts of structural brain damage. (iv) A similar electrophysiological defect, implying impairment of brain function, occurs in patients showing severe anxiety during prolonged periods of difficulty in over-all adaptation.
In echolocating bats, the primary cue for determining distance to a target is the interval between an emitted orientation sound and its echo. Whereas frequency is represented by place in the bat cochlea, no anatomical location represents of primary range. Target range is coded by the time interval between grouped discharges of primary auditory neurons in response to both the emitted sound and its echo. In the frequency-modulated-signal processing area of the auditory cortex of the mustache bat (Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus), neurons respond poorly or not at all to synthesized orientation sounds or echoes alone but respond vigorously to echoes following the emitted sound with a specific delay from targets at a specific range. These range-tuned neurons are systemically arranged along the rostrocaudal axis of the frequency-modulated-signal processing area according to the delays to which they best respond, and thus represent target range in terms of cortical organization. The frequency-modulated-signal processing area therefore shows odotopic representation.
Projections from medial preoptic area (mPOA) and medial anterior hypothalamic area (mAHA) neurons were investigated in albino rats with the use of tritiated amino acid autoradiography. Both the mPOA and the mAHA gave long-axon projections to structures in limbic forebrain and midbrain as well as short-axon projections to other hypothalamic regions. Differences between mPOA and mAHA neurons were observed in projections to the mid-septal region, ventromedial hypothalamus, premammillary region, and central gray. Further, while axons from the mPOA traveled within the medial forebrain bundle, those from the mAHA remained in a band ventromedial to the fornix. These anatomical differences may underlie functional differences between the mPOA and mAHA which have been demonstrated with other experimental techniques.
The orbital part of prefrontal cortex appears to be crucially involved in the motivational control of goal-directed behaviour. Patients with lesions of orbitofrontal cortex show impairments in making decisions about the expected outcome of actions. Monkeys with orbitofrontal lesions respond abnormally to changes in reward expectations and show altered reward preferences. As rewards constitute basic goals of behaviour, we investigated here how neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex of monkeys process information about liquid and food rewards in a typical frontal task, spatial delayed responding. The activity of orbitofrontal neurons increases in response to reward-predicting signals, during the expectation of rewards, and after the receipt of rewards. Neurons discriminate between different rewards, mainly irrespective of the spatial and visual features of reward-predicting stimuli and behavioural reactions. Most reward discriminations reflect the animals' relative preference among the available rewards, as expressed by their choice behaviour, rather than physical reward properties. Thus, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex appear to process the motivational value of rewarding outcomes of voluntary action.
The deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides into amyloid plaques precedes the cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by years. Biomarkers indicative of brain amyloid burden could be useful for identifying individuals at high risk for developing AD. As in AD in humans, baseline plasma Abeta levels in a transgenic mouse model of AD did not correlate with brain amyloid burden. However, after peripheral administration of a monoclonal antibody to Abeta (m266), we observed a rapid increase in plasma Abeta and the magnitude of this increase was highly correlated with amyloid burden in the hippocampus and cortex. This method may be useful for quantifying brain amyloid burden in patients at risk for or those who have been diagnosed with AD.
Acid-sensing is associated with both nociception and taste transduction. Stimulation of sensory neurons by acid is of particular interest, because acidosis accompanies many painful inflammatory and ischaemic conditions. The pain caused by acids is thought to be mediated by H+-gated cation channels present in sensory neurons. We have now cloned a H+-gated channel (ASIC, for acid-sensing ionic channel) that belongs to the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel/degenerin family of ion channels. Heterologous expression of ASIC induces an amiloride-sensitive cation (Na+ > Ca2+ > K+) channel which is transiently activated by rapid extracellular acidification. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of the ASIC channel closely match the H+-gated cation channel described in sensory neurons. ASIC is expressed in dorsal root ganglia and is also distributed widely throughout the brain. ASIC appears to be the simplest of ligand-gated channels.
Release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the mesolimbic system of the brain mediates the reinforcing properties of several drugs of abuse, including nicotine. Here we investigate the contribution of the high-affinity neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to the effects of nicotine on the mesolimbic dopamine system in mice lacking the beta2 subunit of this receptor. We found that nicotine stimulates dopamine release in the ventral striatum of wild-type mice but not in the ventral striatum of beta2-mutant mice. Using patch-clamp recording, we show that mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons from mice without the beta2 subunit no longer respond to nicotine, and that self-administration of nicotine is attenuated in these mutant mice. Our results strongly support the idea that the beta2-containing neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is involved in mediating the reinforcing properties of nicotine.
Id proteins may control cell differentiation by interfering with DNA binding of transcription factors. Here we show that targeted disruption of the dominant negative helix-loop-helix proteins Id1 and Id3 in mice results in premature withdrawal of neuroblasts from the cell cycle and expression of neural-specific differentiation markers. The Id1-Id3 double knockout mice also display vascular malformations in the forebrain and an absence of branching and sprouting of blood vessels into the neuroectoderm. As angiogenesis both in the brain and in tumours requires invasion of avascular tissue by endothelial cells, we examined the Id knockout mice for their ability to support the growth of tumour xenografts. Three different tumours failed to grow and/or metastasize in Id1+/- Id3-/- mice, and any tumour growth present showed poor vascularization and extensive necrosis. Thus, the Id genes are required to maintain the timing of neuronal differentiation in the embryo and invasiveness of the vasculature. Because the Id genes are expressed at very low levels in adults, they make attractive new targets for anti-angiogenic drug design.
The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a sialoglycoprotein of M(r) 33-35K that is expressed predominantly in neurons. In transmissible and genetic neurodegenerative disorders such as scrapie of sheep, spongiform encephalopathy of cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob or Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker diseases of humans, PrPC is converted into an altered form (termed PrPSc) which is distinguishable from its normal homologue by its relative resistance to protease digestion. PrPSc accumulates in the central nervous system of affected individuals, and its protease-resistant core aggregates extracellularly into amyloid fibrils. The process is accompanied by nerve cell loss, whose pathogenesis and molecular basis are not understood. We report here that neuronal death results from chronic exposure of primary rat hippocampal cultures to micromolar concentrations of a peptide corresponding to residues 106-126 of the amino-acid sequence deduced from human PrP complementary DNA. DNA fragmentation of degenerating neurons indicates that cell death occurred by apoptosis. The PrP peptide 106-126 has a high intrinsic ability to polymerize into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. These findings indicate that cerebral accumulation of PrPSc and its degradation products may play a role in the nerve cell degeneration that occurs in prion-related encephalopathies.
In the mouse, each class of olfactory receptor neurons expressing a given odorant receptor has convergent axonal projections to two specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, thereby creating an odour map. However, it is unclear how this map is represented in the olfactory cortex. Here we combine rabies-virus-dependent retrograde mono-trans-synaptic labelling with genetics to control the location, number and type of 'starter' cortical neurons, from which we trace their presynaptic neurons. We find that individual cortical neurons receive input from multiple mitral cells representing broadly distributed glomeruli. Different cortical areas represent the olfactory bulb input differently. For example, the cortical amygdala preferentially receives dorsal olfactory bulb input, whereas the piriform cortex samples the whole olfactory bulb without obvious bias. These differences probably reflect different functions of these cortical areas in mediating innate odour preference or associative memory. The trans-synaptic labelling method described here should be widely applicable to mapping connections throughout the mouse nervous system.
Intracellular recordings and electroencephalograms were obtained from neurons of the motor cortex during augmnenting responses elicited by repetitive stimulation of its specific thalamic nucleus. The postsynaptic potentials during fully developed augmenting responses consistedf two depolarizing waves with two separate groups of spike dicharges of different latencies, the bases of the spikes, the so-called "firing-levels," sometimes shifting. This supports the concept that the postsynaptic potentials accompanying the augmentintg response consist of a primary response and a response of recruiting character.
The function of neuropeptide Y, one of the most abundant peptide transmitters of the mammalian brain, remains unclear because of a lack of specific receptor antagonists. An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to the NH2-terminus of the rat Y1 receptor was constructed and added to cultures of rat cortical neurons. This treatment resulted in a reduced density of Y1 (but not Y2) receptors and diminished the decrease in adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) usually seen after Y1 receptor activation. Repeated injection of the same oligodeoxynucleotide into the lateral cerebral ventricle of rats was followed by a similar reduction of cortical Y1 (but not Y2) receptors. Such antisense-treated animals displayed behavioral signs of anxiety. Thus, specific inhibition of neurotransmitter receptor expression can be accomplished in the living brain and demonstrates that altered central neuropeptide Y transmission produces an anxiety-like state.
Hippocampal place cells are a model system of how the brain constructs cognitive representations and of how these representations support complex behavior, learning, and memory. There is, however, a lack of detailed knowledge about the properties of hippocampal afferents. We recorded multiple single units from the hippocampus and the medial and lateral entorhinal areas of behaving rats. Although many medial entorhinal neurons had highly specific place fields, lateral entorhinal neurons displayed weak spatial specificity. This finding demonstrates a fundamental dissociation between the information conveyed to the hippocampus by its major input streams, with spatial information represented by the medial and nonspatial information represented by the lateral entorhinal cortex.
One presentation of a word to a subject is enough to change the way in which the word is processed subsequently, even when there is no conscious (explicit) memory of the original presentation. This phenomenon is known as implicit memory. The neural correlates of implicit memory have been studied previously, but they have never been compared with the correlates of explicit memory while holding task conditions constant or while using a procedure that ensured that the neural correlates were not 'contaminated' by explicit memory. Here we use scalp-recorded event-related brain potentials to identify neural activity associated with implicit and explicit memory during the performance of a recognition memory task. Relative to new words, recently studied words produced activity in three neuroanatomically and functionally dissociable neural populations. One of these populations was activated whether or not the word was consciously recognized, and its activity therefore represents a neural correlate of implicit memory. Thus, when task and memory contamination effects are eliminated, the neural correlates of explicit and implicit memory differ qualitatively.
The neocortex of the adult brain consists of neurons and glia that are generated by precursor cells of the embryonic ventricular zone. In general, glia are generated after neurons during development, but radial glia are an exception to this rule. Radial glia are generated before neurogenesis and guide neuronal migration. Radial glia are mitotically active throughout neurogenesis, and disappear or become astrocytes when neuronal migration is complete. Although the lineage relationships of cortical neurons and glia have been explored, the clonal relationship of radial glia to other cortical cells remains unknown. It has been suggested that radial glia may be neuronal precursors, but this has not been demonstrated in vivo. We have used a retroviral vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein to label precursor cells in vivo and have examined clones 1-3 days later using morphological, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological techniques. Here we show that clones consist of mitotic radial glia and postmitotic neurons, and that neurons migrate along clonally related radial glia. Time-lapse images show that proliferative radial glia generate neurons. Our results support the concept that a lineage relationship between neurons and proliferative radial glia may underlie the radial organization of neocortex.
Since the discovery of opiate receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), it has become apparent that endogenous opiate ligands are involved in CNS function. Most attention has focused on their role in modulating pain, but they have also been implicated in various physiological functions and in disease states. We are concerned with evidence that endogenous opioid peptides may also contribute to the neurological deficits arising from cerebral ischaemia. Dynorphin, which is widely distributed in the brain and pituitary, has been reported to produce unusual motor and behavioural effects and may act as a regulatory neuropeptide, not as a classical opiate agonist or antagonist. We have therefore administered to cats in which the right middle cerebral artery had been occluded both dynorphin (1-13) and analogue and control materials. We find that dynorphin (1-13) prolongs survival.
Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by sleepiness and episodes of cataplexy. Cataplexy is an abrupt loss of muscle tone, most often triggered by sudden, strong emotions. A subset of cells in the medial medulla of the narcoleptic dog discharged at high rates only in cataplexy and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These cells were noncholinergic and were localized to ventromedial and caudal portions of the nucleus magnocellularis. The localization and discharge pattern of these cells indicate that cataplexy results from a triggering in waking of the neurons responsible for the suppression of muscle tone in REM sleep. However, most medullary cells were inactive during cataplexy but were active during REM sleep. These data demonstrate that cataplexy is a distinct behavioral state, differing from other sleep and waking states in its pattern of brainstem neuronal activity.
In the mammalian eye, the ON-centre and OFF-centre retinal ganglion cells form two major pathways projecting to central visual structures from the retina. These two pathways originate at the bipolar cell level: one class of bipolar cells becomes hyperpolarized in response to light, as do all photoreceptor cells, and the other class becomes depolarized on exposure to light, thereby inverting the receptor signal. It has recently become possible to examine the functional role of the ON-pathway in vision by selectively blocking it at the bipolar cell level using the glutamate neurotransmitter analogue 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB)1. APB application to monkey, cat and rabbit retinas abolishes ON responses in retinal ganglion cells, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the visual cortex but has no effect on the centre-surround antagonism of OFF cells or the orientation and direction selectivities in the cortex2-5. These and related findings6-11 suggest that the ON and OFF pathways remain largely separate through the lateral geniculate nucleus and that in the cortex, contrary to some hypotheses, they are not directly involved in mechanisms giving rise to orientation and direction selectivities. We have examined the roles of the ON and OFF channels in vision in rhesus monkeys trained to do visual detection and discrimination tasks. We report here that the ON channel is reversibly blocked by injection of APB into the vitreous. Detection of light increment but not of light decrement is severely impaired, and there is a pronounced loss in contrast sensitivity. The perception of shape, colour, flicker, movement and stereo images is only mildly impaired, but longer times are required for their discrimination. Our results suggest that two reasons that the mammalian visual system has both ON and OFF channels is to yield equal sensitivity and rapid information transfer for both incremental and decremental light stimuli and to facilitate high contrast sensitivity.
Using sensory information for the prediction of future events is essential for survival. Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by environmental cues that predict rewards, but the cellular mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain elusive. We used in vivo voltammetry and in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology to show that both dopamine release to reward predictive cues and enhanced synaptic strength onto dopamine neurons develop over the course of cue-reward learning. Increased synaptic strength was not observed after stable behavioral responding. Thus, enhanced synaptic strength onto dopamine neurons may act to facilitate the transformation of neutral environmental stimuli to salient reward-predictive cues.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent mitogen with hormonal activity in the gastrointestinal tract. Material cross-reacting with EGF was detected in the central nervous system of the developing and adult albino rat by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. High concentrations of EGF-cross-reacting material were identified in forebrain and midbrain structures of pallidal areas of the brain. These include the globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, and the islands of Calleja . Thus, EGF may represent another gut-brain peptide with potential neurotransmitter-neuromodulator functions in pallidal structures of the extrapyramidal motor systems of the brain.
Unilateral lesions in the visual and somesthetic cortex of rat brain cause a slight but significant increase inc the cortical cholinesterase activity in the contralateral hemisphere. There is some indication of strain differences in this effect. No change in cholinesterase activity is found in the subcortical brain. These findings may be helpful in understanding mechanisms of interdependence among brain areas.
A 3-year-old Negro female showed clinical evidence of a neurovisceral storage disorder that has been characterized by the specific elevation of lactosyl ceramide in erythrocytes, plasma, bone marrow, urine sediment, liver biopsy, and brain biopsy. A galactosyl hydrolase deficiency was demonstrated by the inability to cleave lactosyl ceramide labeled with tritium in the terminal galactose. The enzyme deficiency may be the primary cause of this previously unreported sphingolipidosis.
The prefrontal cortex is involved in the cognitive process of working memory. Local injections of SCH23390 and SCH39166, selective antagonists of the D1 dopamine receptor, into the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys induced errors and increased latency in performance on an oculomotor task that required memory-guided saccades. The deficit was dose-dependent and sensitive to the duration of the delay period. These D1 antagonists had no effect on performance in a control task requiring visually guided saccades, indicating that sensory and motor functions were unaltered. Thus, D1 dopamine receptors play a selective role in the mnemonic, predictive functions of the primate prefrontal cortex.
Injection of angiotensin II (AII) into the cerebral ventricles at doses as low as 1 pmol h-1 results in a marked stimulation of salt and water ingestion in the rat. Evidence that AII is produced in the central nervous system independently of the circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) raises the possibility that endogenous brain AII is involved in the physiological regulation of thirst. The role of brain AII in salt appetite is still unclear. Here we confirm that the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), believed to have elevated levels of brain AII, possesses an exaggerated salt appetite compared with its normotensive controls. We also show that this exaggerated salt appetite is reduced by chronic central treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, while that of the normotensive controls is unaffected. Our study suggests that a central neuropeptide, probably AII, is involved in the maintenance of the exaggerated salt appetite in this model of hypertension.
Electrical microstimulation can establish causal links between the activity of groups of neurons and perceptual and cognitive functions. However, the number and identities of neurons microstimulated, as well as the number of action potentials evoked, are difficult to ascertain. To address these issues we introduced the light-gated algal channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) specifically into a small fraction of layer 2/3 neurons of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex. ChR2 photostimulation in vivo reliably generated stimulus-locked action potentials at frequencies up to 50 Hz. Here we show that naive mice readily learned to detect brief trains of action potentials (five light pulses, 1 ms, 20 Hz). After training, mice could detect a photostimulus firing a single action potential in approximately 300 neurons. Even fewer neurons (approximately 60) were required for longer stimuli (five action potentials, 250 ms). Our results show that perceptual decisions and learning can be driven by extremely brief epochs of cortical activity in a sparse subset of supragranular cortical pyramidal neurons.
Tau protein is a family of microtubule binding proteins, heterogeneous in molecular weight, that are induced during neurite outgrowth and are found prominently in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. The predicted amino acid sequences of two forms of tau protein from mouse brain were determined from complementary DNA clones. These forms are identical in their amino-terminal sequences but differ in their carboxyl-terminal domains. Both proteins contain repeated sequences that may be tubulin binding sites. The sequence suggests that tau is an elongated molecule with no extensive alpha-helical or beta-sheet domains. These complementary DNAs should enable the study of various functional domains of tau and the study of tau expression in normal and pathological states.
Treatment with the dopamine precursor L-dopa produced a significant accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in the caudate nucleus of the rat. In contrast, there was no change in the amount of cyclic AMP in the cerebellum. Accumulation of cyclic AMP in the caudate nucleus after administration of L-dopa was prevented by prior treatment with the decarboxylase inhibitor RO 4-4602. These observations and those in other laboratories support the assumption that dopamine formed from L-dopa selectively activates striatal adenylate cyclase. The in vivo activation of adenylate cyclase after treatment with L-dopa may be a useful model for studying neurological and psychiatric disorders that are thought to involve the dopaminergic system of the brain.
Stimulus-evoked oscillatory synchronization of activity has been observed in many neural systems, including the cerebral cortex of mammals and the brain of insects. The possible functions of such rhythmic synchronization in neural coding, however, remain largely speculative. In the locust, odours evoke activity in dynamic (evolving) ensembles of transiently synchronized neurons. We report here that the active neurons composing these ensembles change in a stimulus-specific manner and with a high degree of reliability on a cycle-by-cycle basis during an odour response. Hence, information about an odour is contained not only in the neural assembly active at each oscillation cycle, but also in the precise temporal sequence in which these assemblies are updated during an odour response. Neural coding with oscillations thus allows combinatorial representations in time as well as in space.
Central catecholamines play an important part in the regulation of hormone secretion from the pituitary gland and in the mediation of male and female sexual behaviour. Noradrenaline has been shown to stimulate the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) probably by influencing the secretion of LH-releasing hormone (LHRH). The medial preoptic and hypothalamic areas, including the median eminence, contain noradrenaline-containing terminals which originate from discrete noradrenaline-containing cell groups in the lower brain stem. These cell groups have been identified in the pons and the medulla oblongata by histochemical methods and pharmacological experiments. Recent studies with antiserum to dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), the enzyme that converts dopamine to noradrenaline, provided evidence for the existence of noradrenergic cells. These include the locus coeruleus (group A6), a ventrally located more diffuse but continuous subcoeruleus group (group A5), a cell group located dorsal to the nucleus (n.) dorsalis motorius nervi vagi (group A2) and a cell group in or near the nucleus reticularis lateralis (group A1). Using the thaw-mount autoradiographic technique, oestradiol-concentrating neurones have been localized in many areas of the lower brain stem, including the locus coeruleus, n. tractus solitarii, n. dorsalis motorius nervi vagi, and reticular formation where catecholamine-containing neurones exist. We report here the simultaneous localization, in the same histological section, of 3H-oestradiol and the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase in neurones of the rat lower brain stem with a combined technique of thaw-mount autoradiography and immunohistochemistry, demonstrating that noradrenaline- or adrenaline-containing neurones are oestradiol target cells.
Neuronal cell bodies and synaptic terminals positive for glutamic acid decarboxylase, the enzyme responsible for synthesizing gamma-amino butyric acid, have been located by immunocytochemical staining in all layers of the macaque monkey cortex. In layers II and III the staining pattern of periodic dots is identical with that seen in sections stained for cytochrome oxidase. The rows of dots run parallel with the ocular dominance columns, suggesting that the labelled neurones are preferentially related to each eye.
Our inferences about brain mechanisms underlying perception rely on whether it is possible for the brain to 'reconstruct' a stimulus from the information contained in the spike trains from many neurons. How the brain actually accomplishes this reconstruction remains largely unknown. Oscillatory and synchronized activities in the brain of mammals have been correlated with distinct behavioural states or the execution of complex cognitive tasks and are proposed to participate in the 'binding' of individual features into more complex percepts. But if synchronization is indeed relevant, what senses it? In insects, oscillatory synchronized activity in the early olfactory system seems to be necessary for fine odour discrimination and enables the encoding of information about a stimulus in spike times relative to the oscillatory 'clock. Here we study the decoding of these coherent oscillatory signals. We identify a population of neurons downstream from the odour-activated, synchronized neuronal assemblies. These downstream neurons show odour responses whose specificity is degraded when their inputs are desynchronized. This degradation of selectivity consists of the appearance of responses to new odours and a loss of discrimination of spike trains evoked by different odours. Such loss of information is never observed in the upstream neurons whose activity is desynchronized. These results indicate that information encoded in time across ensembles of neurons converges onto single neurons downstream in the pathway.
The action of desipramine on the norepinephrine-sensitive adenylate cyclase system and the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat cortex was studied after selective lesioning of serotonergic neurons with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. In animals with lesions desipramine failed to reduce the density of beta-adrenoceptors but decreased the response of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate to isoproterenol and norepinephrine to the same degree as in animals without lesions. The results demonstrate a functional linkage between serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the rat cortex, with beta-adrenergic receptors and neurohormonal sensitivity of the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-generating system being under separate regulatory control.
Mitochondria continuously undergo two opposing processes, fission and fusion. The disruption of this dynamic equilibrium may herald cell injury or death and may contribute to developmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Nitric oxide functions as a signaling molecule, but in excess it mediates neuronal injury, in part via mitochondrial fission or fragmentation. However, the underlying mechanism for nitric oxide-induced pathological fission remains unclear. We found that nitric oxide produced in response to beta-amyloid protein, thought to be a key mediator of Alzheimer's disease, triggered mitochondrial fission, synaptic loss, and neuronal damage, in part via S-nitrosylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (forming SNO-Drp1). Preventing nitrosylation of Drp1 by cysteine mutation abrogated these neurotoxic events. SNO-Drp1 is increased in brains of human Alzheimer's disease patients and may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration.
The arginine residue at position 586 of the GluR-B subunit renders heteromeric alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-sensitive glutamate receptor channels impermeable to calcium. The codon for this arginine is introduced at the precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) stage by site-selective adenosine editing of a glutamine codon. Heterozygous mice engineered by gene targeting to harbor an editing-incompetent GluR-B allele synthesized unedited GluR-B subunits and, in principal neurons and interneurons, expressed AMPA receptors with increased calcium permeability. These mice developed seizures and died by 3 weeks of age, showing that GluR-B pre-mRNA editing is essential for brain function.
In the brains of deceased schizophrenics who underwent long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs, the concentration of homovanillic acid (a dopamine metabolite) was significantly increased in the orbital frontal, cingulate, and temporal tip areas of the cortex, but not in the putamen or the nucleus accumbens. The concentration of homovanillic acid was normal in the brains of schizophrenics who were not treated with drugs.
Anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid ligand, binds to CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the brain and mimics the neurobehavioural actions of marijuana. Cannabinoids and anandamide also elicit hypotension mediated by peripheral CB1 receptors. Here we report that a selective CB1 receptor antagonist, SR141716A, elicits an increase in blood pressure in rats subjected to haemorrhagic shock, whereas similar treatment of normotensive rats or intracerebroventricular administration of the antagonist during shock do not affect blood pressure. Blood from haemorrhaged rats causes hypotension in normal rats, which can be prevented by SR141716A but not by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase in the recipient. Macrophages and platelets from haemorrhaged rats elicit CB1 receptor-mediated hypotension in normotensive recipients, and incorporate arachidonic acid or ethanolamine into a product that co-elutes with anandamide on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Also, macrophages from control rats stimulated with ionomycin or bacterial phospholipase D produce anandamide, as identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. These findings indicate that activation of peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors contributes to haemorrhagic hypotension, and anandamide produced by macrophages may be a mediator of this effect.
The ventral premotor cortex in primates is thought to be involved in sensory-motor integration. Many of its neurons respond to visual stimuli in the space near the arms or face. In this study on the ventral premotor cortex of monkeys, an object was presented within the visual receptive fields of individual neurons, then the lights were turned off and the object was silently removed. A subset of the neurons continued to respond in the dark as if the object were still present and visible. Such cells exhibit "object permanence," encoding the presence of an object that is no longer visible. These cells may underlie the ability to reach toward or avoid objects that are no longer directly visible.
To generate different cell types, some cells can segregate protein determinants into one of their two daughter cells during mitosis. In Drosophila neuroblasts, the Par protein complex localizes apically and directs localization of the cell fate determinants Prospero and Numb and the adaptor proteins Miranda and Pon to the basal cell cortex, to ensure their segregation into the basal daughter cell. The Par protein complex has a conserved function in establishing cell polarity but how it directs proteins to the opposite side is unknown. We show here that a principal function of this complex is to phosphorylate the cytoskeletal protein Lethal (2) giant larvae (Lgl; also known as L(2)gl). Phosphorylation by Drosophila atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), a member of the Par protein complex, releases Lgl from its association with membranes and the actin cytoskeleton. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that Lgl phosphorylation prevents the localization of cell fate determinants to the apical cell cortex. Lgl promotes cortical localization of Miranda, and we propose that phosphorylation of Lgl by aPKC at the apical neuroblast cortex restricts Lgl activity and Miranda localization to the opposite, basal side of the cell.
Transient periods of synchronization of oscillating neuronal discharges in the frequency range 30-80 Hz (gamma oscillations) have been proposed to act as an integrative mechanism that may bring a widely distributed set of neurons together into a coherent ensemble that underlies a cognitive act. Results of several experiments in animals provide support for this idea. In humans, gamma oscillations have been described both on the scalp (measured by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography) and in intracortical recordings, but no direct participation of synchrony in a cognitive task has been demonstrated so far. Here we record electrical brain activity from subjects who are viewing ambiguous visual stimuli (perceived either as faces or as meaningless shapes). We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that only face perception induces a long-distance pattern of synchronization, corresponding to the moment of perception itself and to the ensuing motor response. A period of strong desynchronization marks the transition between the moment of perception and the motor response. We suggest that this desynchronization reflects a process of active uncoupling of the underlying neural ensembles that is necessary to proceed from one cognitive state to another.
A method is described to implant a permanent indwelling polyethylene tube venting to the surface of the cerebral cortex of the dog. Morphine, amobarbital, or imipramine was administered through the tube, and behavioral changes were observed in unanesthetized and unrestrained animals. The results are different from those occurring after intraventricular injection.
A variety of evidence indicates that calcium-dependent protein phosphorylation modulates the release of neurotransmitter from nerve terminals. For instance, the injection of rat calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Ca2+/CaM-dependent PK II) into the preterminal digit of the squid giant synapse leads to an increase in the release of a so-far unidentified neurotransmitter induced by presynaptic depolarization. But until now, it has not been demonstrated that Ca2+/CaM-dependent PK II can also regulate neurotransmitter release in the vertebrate nervous system. Here we report that the introduction of Ca2+/CaM-dependent PK II, autoactivated by thiophosphorylation, into rat brain synaptosomes (isolated nerve terminals) increases the initial rate of induced release of two neurotransmitters, glutamate and noradrenaline. We also show that introduction of a selective peptidergic inhibitor of Ca2+/CaM-dependent PK II inhibits the initial rate of induced glutamate release. These results support the hypothesis that activation of Ca2+/CaM-dependent PK II in the nerve terminal removes a constraint on neurotransmitter release.
In several species the myometrium is quiescent shortly before parturition. At this time high titres of relaxin are present in the plasma and there is evidence that the hormone has a direct inhibitory action on the uterine muscle. Relaxin could also contribute to uterine quiescence by inhibiting oxytocin release. To determine whether relaxin has a central action on the release of oxytocin, we have studied the effect of intravenous injections of porcine relaxin on milk ejection in the anaesthetized lactating rat. We report that reflex milk ejection was suppressed by relaxin in a dose-dependent manner, the onset of inhibition being rapid and lasting from 10 to 60 min. After the period of inhibition the normal temporal pattern of reflex milk ejection was resumed. Mammary sensitivity to exogenous or endogenous oxytocin was reduced by relaxin but not sufficiently to explain the effects observed. Furthermore, relaxin (1 microgram per rat) injected into the cerebral ventricles profoundly disturbed the pattern of reflex milk ejection without affecting the response of the mammary gland to oxytocin. These results suggest a novel role for relaxin within the central nervous system. The site in the brain at which the effects of relaxin are exerted remains unknown.
A general function of cerebral cortex is to allow the flexible association of sensory stimuli with specific behaviours. Many neurons in parietal, prefrontal and motor cortical areas are activated both by particular movements and by sensory cues that trigger these movements, suggesting a role in linking sensation to action. For example, neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) encode both the location of visual stimuli and the direction of saccadic eye movements. LIP is not believed to encode non-spatial stimulus attributes such as colour. Here we investigated whether LIP would encode colour if colour was behaviourally linked to the eye movement. We trained monkeys to make an eye movement in one of two directions based alternately on the colour or location of a visual cue. When cue colour was relevant for directing eye movement, we found a substantial fraction of LIP neurons selective for cue colour. However, when cue location was relevant, colour selectivity was virtually absent in LIP. These results demonstrate that selectivity of cortical neurons can change as a function of the required behaviour.
Synaptic circuits in the retina transform visual input gathered by photoreceptors into messages that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) send to the brain. Processes of retinal interneurons (amacrine and bipolar cells) form synapses on dendrites of RGCs in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). The IPL is divided into at least 10 parallel sublaminae; subsets of interneurons and RGCs arborize and form synapses in just one or a few of them. These lamina-specific circuits determine the visual features to which RGC subtypes respond. Here we show that four closely related immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) adhesion molecules--Dscam (Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule), DscamL (refs 6-9), Sidekick-1 and Sidekick-2 (ref. 10)--are expressed in chick by non-overlapping subsets of interneurons and RGCs that form synapses in distinct IPL sublaminae. Moreover, each protein is concentrated within the appropriate sublaminae and each mediates homophilic adhesion. Loss- and gain-of-function studies in vivo indicate that these IgSF members participate in determining the IPL sublaminae in which synaptic partners arborize and connect. Thus, vertebrate Dscams, like Drosophila Dscams, play roles in neural connectivity. Together, our results on Dscams and Sidekicks suggest the existence of an IgSF code for laminar specificity in retina and, by implication, in other parts of the central nervous system.
Electrophysiology, the 'gold standard' for investigating neuronal signalling, is being challenged by a new generation of optical probes. Together with new forms of microscopy, these probes allow us to measure and control neuronal signals with spatial resolution and genetic specificity that already greatly surpass those of electrophysiology. We predict that the photon will progressively replace the electron for probing neuronal function, particularly for targeted stimulation and silencing of neuronal populations. Although electrophysiological characterization of channels, cells and neural circuits will remain necessary, new combinations of electrophysiology and imaging should lead to transformational discoveries in neuroscience.
Spontaneous activity in the developing auditory system is required for neuronal survival as well as the refinement and maintenance of tonotopic maps in the brain. However, the mechanisms responsible for initiating auditory nerve firing in the absence of sound have not been determined. Here we show that supporting cells in the developing rat cochlea spontaneously release ATP, which causes nearby inner hair cells to depolarize and release glutamate, triggering discrete bursts of action potentials in primary auditory neurons. This endogenous, ATP-mediated signalling synchronizes the output of neighbouring inner hair cells, which may help refine tonotopic maps in the brain. Spontaneous ATP-dependent signalling rapidly subsides after the onset of hearing, thereby preventing this experience-independent activity from interfering with accurate encoding of sound. These data indicate that supporting cells in the organ of Corti initiate electrical activity in auditory nerves before hearing, pointing to an essential role for peripheral, non-sensory cells in the development of central auditory pathways.
In many regions of the cerebral cortex, Ca2+ influx through NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) sensitive glutamate receptors (NMDA receptors) can trigger two forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP). LTD is induced by low levels of postsynaptic NMDA-receptor activation, for instance in response to low-frequency stimulation, whereas LTP is induced by the stronger activation that occurs following high-frequency stimulation. Theoretical studies have shown that the properties of synaptic LTD and LTP can account for many aspects of experience-dependent plasticity in the developing visual cortex, provided that the LTD-LTP crossover point (the modification threshold, theta(m)) varies as a function of the history of cortical activity. Here we provide direct experimental evidence that the value of theta(m) depends on sensory experience. We find in visual cortex of light-deprived rats that LTP is enhanced and LTD diminished over a range of stimulation frequencies, and that these effects can be reversed by as little as two days of light exposure. Our findings support the idea that a variable synaptic modification threshold allows synaptic weights in neural networks to achieve a stable equilibrium.
There is increasing evidence that neurotrophins (NTs) are involved in processes of neuronal plasticity besides their well-established actions in regulating the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of functions of specific populations of neurons. Nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-4/5, and corresponding antibodies dramatically modify the development of the visual cortex. Although the neuronal elements involved have not yet been identified, complementary studies of other systems have demonstrated that NT synthesis is rapidly regulated by neuronal activity and that NTs are released in an activity-dependent manner from neuronal dendrites. These data, together with the observation that NTs enhance transmitter release from neurons that express the corresponding signal-transducing Trk receptors, suggest a role for NTs as selective retrograde messengers that regulate synaptic efficacy.
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cortex. Activation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors hyperpolarizes cells and inhibits neuronal activity. Synaptic responses mediated by GABAA receptors also strongly excited hippocampal neurons. This excitatory response was recorded in morphologically identified interneurons in the presence of 4-aminopyridine or after elevation of extracellular potassium concentrations. The synaptic excitation sustained by GABAA receptors synchronized the activity of inhibitory interneurons. This synchronized discharge of interneurons in turn elicited large-amplitude inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in pyramidal and granule cells. Excitatory synaptic responses mediated by GABAA receptors may thus provide a mechanism for the recruitment of GABAergic interneurons through their recurrent connections.
The prevailing view is that the popular recreational drug (+/-)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or "ecstasy") is a selective serotonin neurotoxin in animals and possibly in humans. Nonhuman primates exposed to several sequential doses of MDMA, a regimen modeled after one used by humans, developed severe brain dopaminergic neurotoxicity, in addition to less pronounced serotonergic neurotoxicity. MDMA neurotoxicity was associated with increased vulnerability to motor dysfunction secondary to dopamine depletion. These results have implications for mechanisms of MDMA neurotoxicity and suggest that recreational MDMA users may unwittingly be putting themselves at risk, either as young adults or later in life, for developing neuropsychiatric disorders related to brain dopamine and/or serotonin deficiency.
For hypothyroid rats, spontaneous motor activity was less than that in matched normal controls, and the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the midbrain was significantly greater than that in controls. Rats made hyperthyroid with thyroxine became hyperactive and showed increased sensitivity to the behaviorally activating effects of norepinephrine administered intraventricularly. In hyperthyroid rats, the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the midbrain remained within the normal range. These results are consonant with studies that suggested both receptor "tuning" and feedback regulation of activity of enzymes involved in biosynthesis of presynaptic neurotransmitter as methods of regulation of the central catecholamine synapse. These results may also help explain the reported potentiation by thyroid hormone of the antidepressant effects of imipramine.
Much is known about how people make decisions under varying levels of probability (risk). Less is known about the neural basis of decision-making when probabilities are uncertain because of missing information (ambiguity). In decision theory, ambiguity about probabilities should not affect choices. Using functional brain imaging, we show that the level of ambiguity in choices correlates positively with activation in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, and negatively with a striatal system. Moreover, striatal activity correlates positively with expected reward. Neurological subjects with orbitofrontal lesions were insensitive to the level of ambiguity and risk in behavioral choices. These data suggest a general neural circuit responding to degrees of uncertainty, contrary to decision theory.
Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent survival factor for embryonic midbrain dopaminergic, spinal motor, cranial sensory, sympathetic, and hindbrain noradrenergic neurons, and is available to these cells in vivo. It is therefore considered a physiological trophic factor and a potential therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that at postnatal day 0 (P0), GDNF-deficient mice have deficits in dorsal root ganglion, sympathetic and nodose neurons, but not in hindbrain noradrenergic or midbrain dopaminergic neurons. These mice completely lack the enteric nervous system (ENS), ureters and kidneys. Thus GDNF is important for the development and/or survival of enteric, sympathetic and sensory neurons and the renal system, but is not essential for catecholaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS).
Feeding behavior of Aplysia is associated with an arousal state characterized by a constellation of maintained behaviors and by a potentiation or depression of responses to specific stimuli. A neuron (the cerebral-pedal regulator or CPR) that has widespread actions on various systems connected with feeding has been identified. CPR excites neurons that modulate or drive (i) body posture, (ii) biting, and (iii) cardiovascular behaviors. CPR also inhibits neurons concerned with defensive responses. Food stimuli, which elicit food arousal in the animal, produce prolonged excitation of the CPR. The results suggest that the CPR may evoke a central motive state representing the neuronal correlate of feeding motivation.
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy are initiated by extracerebral exposure to prions. Although prion transmission from extracerebral sites to the brain represents a potential target for prophylaxis, attempts at vaccination have been limited by the poor immunogenicity of prion proteins. To circumvent this, we expressed an anti-prion protein (anti-PrP) mu chain in Prnp(o/o) mice. Transgenic mice developed sustained anti-PrP titers, which were not suppressed by introduction of Prnp+ alleles. Transgene expression prevented pathogenesis of prions introduced by intraperitoneal injection in the spleen and brain. Expression of endogenous PrP (PrP(C)) in the spleen and brain was unaffected, suggesting that immunity was responsible for protection. This indicates the feasibility of immunological inhibition of prion disease in vivo.
Autoradiography is widely and successfully used to image the distribution of radiolabelled tracer molecules in biological samples. The method is, however, limited in resolution and sensitivity, especially for 14C. Here we describe a new method for imaging 14C-labelled tracers in sections of biological tissue. A highly focused beam of gallium ions bombards the tissue, which is eroded (sputtered) into constituent atoms, molecules and secondary ions. The 14C ions are detected in the secondary beam by the most sensitive method available, namely accelerator mass spectrometry. The specimen is scanned pixel by pixel (1 x 2 microm), generating an image in a manner analogous to scanning electron microscopy. The method can thus be regarded as a specialized form of scanning secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), referred to here as SIAMS (ref. 2). We have used SIAMS to localize the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in thin sections of cerebral cortex, and show that it can generate 14C images that are much improved on 14C autoradiography. A scan takes 10-20 min and reveals individual axons, neurons and glial cells at high sensitivity. In principle, the resolution could be increased by up to tenfold, and the method could be extended to some other nuclides.
A neuroimaging study examined the neural correlates of social exclusion and tested the hypothesis that the brain bases of social pain are similar to those of physical pain. Participants were scanned while playing a virtual ball-tossing game in which they were ultimately excluded. Paralleling results from physical pain studies, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was more active during exclusion than during inclusion and correlated positively with self-reported distress. Right ventral prefrontal cortex (RVPFC) was active during exclusion and correlated negatively with self-reported distress. ACC changes mediated the RVPFC-distress correlation, suggesting that RVPFC regulates the distress of social exclusion by disrupting ACC activity.
Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (TRH; pyroGlu-His-Pro-NH2) is important in the regulation of adenohypophyseal hormone secretion and also serves neurotropic functions in extra-hypothalamic brain areas, indicating that it is involved in neurotransmission and other forms of cellular communication. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that TRH is hydrolysed at the pyroGlu-His bond by a particulate enzyme located in the synaptosomal and adenohypophyseal plasma membrane. Furthermore, this enzyme has been identified as a heterogeneously distributed ectoenzyme which has a high degree of substrate specificity like the TRH-degrading serum enzyme studied previously. In the rat, the activity of the TRH-degrading serum enzyme has been shown to be influenced by the thyroid status of the animals; here I report that the activity of the membrane-bound TRH-degrading enzyme of the anterior pituitary is stringently controlled by thyroid hormones, but that the activity of the brain enzyme is not.
The segregation of axon and dendrite projections into distinct synaptic layers is a fundamental principle of nervous system organization and the structural basis for information processing in the brain. Layer-specific recognition molecules that allow projecting neurons to stabilize transient contacts and initiate synaptogenesis have been identified. However, most of the neuronal cell-surface molecules critical for layer organization are expressed broadly in the developing nervous system, raising the question of how these so-called permissive adhesion molecules support synaptic specificity. Here we show that the temporal expression dynamics of the zinc-finger protein sequoia is the major determinant of Drosophila photoreceptor connectivity into distinct synaptic layers. Neighbouring R8 and R7 photoreceptors show consecutive peaks of elevated sequoia expression, which correspond to their sequential target-layer innervation. Loss of sequoia in R7 leads to a projection switch into the R8 recipient layer, whereas a prolonged expression in R8 induces a redirection of their axons into the R7 layer. The sequoia-induced axon targeting is mediated through the ubiquitously expressed Cadherin-N cell adhesion molecule. Our data support a model in which recognition specificity during synaptic layer formation is generated through a temporally restricted axonal competence to respond to broadly expressed adhesion molecules. Because developing neurons innervating the same target area often project in a distinct, birth-order-dependent sequence, temporal identity seems to contain crucial information in generating not only cell type diversity during neuronal division but also connection diversity of projecting neurons.
Sensory experiences exert a powerful influence on the function and future performance of neuronal circuits in the mammalian neocortex. Restructuring of synaptic connections is believed to be one mechanism by which cortical circuits store information about the sensory world. Excitatory synaptic structures, such as dendritic spines, are dynamic entities that remain sensitive to alteration of sensory input throughout life. It remains unclear, however, whether structural changes at the level of dendritic spines can outlast the original experience and thereby provide a morphological basis for long-term information storage. Here we follow spine dynamics on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in functionally defined regions of adult mouse visual cortex during plasticity of eye-specific responses induced by repeated closure of one eye (monocular deprivation). The first monocular deprivation episode doubled the rate of spine formation, thereby increasing spine density. This effect was specific to layer-5 cells located in binocular cortex, where most neurons increase their responsiveness to the non-deprived eye. Restoring binocular vision returned spine dynamics to baseline levels, but absolute spine density remained elevated and many monocular deprivation-induced spines persisted during this period of functional recovery. However, spine addition did not increase again when the same eye was closed for a second time. This absence of structural plasticity stands out against the robust changes of eye-specific responses that occur even faster after repeated deprivation. Thus, spines added during the first monocular deprivation experience may provide a structural basis for subsequent functional shifts. These results provide a strong link between functional plasticity and specific synaptic rearrangements, revealing a mechanism of how prior experiences could be stored in cortical circuits.
Alcohol-induced memory impairment in man has been attributed to deficiencies in subcortical noradrenergic and cholinergic systems, as well as to damage in midbrain structures. Korsakoff's psychosis, a disease in which alcohol poisoning causes apparently irreversible memory defects, is characterized by lesions in cholinergic and noradrenergic nuclei and by a decrease in the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the content of noradrenaline (NA) in forebrain areas such as cerebral cortex and hippocampus, innervated by these nuclei. Prolonged intake of ethanol in rodents similarly produces signs of noradrenergic and cholinergic deafferentation in the cortex and hippocampus, as well as persistent memory deficits. To test whether alcohol-induced memory impairments depend on cholinergic deafferentation, we transplanted cholinergic-rich fetal basal forebrain cell suspensions into the cortex and hippocampus of alcohol-treated rats. The substantial and persistent memory losses produced in our rats by ethanol intake were associated with an impairment of cholinergic function, and were reversed by cholinergic-rich transplants into cortex and hippocampus.
Calcium channels play an important role in regulating various neuronal processes, including synaptic transmission and cellular plasticity. The N-type calcium channels, which are sensitive to omega-conotoxin, are involved in the control of transmitter release from neurons. A functional N-type calcium channel complex was purified from rabbit brain. The channel consists of a 230-kilodalton subunit (alpha 1B) that is tightly associated with a 160-kilodalton subunit (alpha 2 delta), a 57-kilodalton subunit (beta 3), and a 95-kilodalton glycoprotein subunit. The complex formed a functional calcium channel with the same pharmacological properties and conductance as those of the native omega-conotoxin-sensitive calcium channel in neurons.
Presumptive chick neuroectoderm responds to RNA from brain and heart by forming neural tubes, but it does not respond to liver RNA. This dif ferential response can be correlated with the presence of Folin-positive material in those RNA preparations which elicit the formation of neural structures.
Somatostatin, the growth hormone-inhibiting factor, when microinjected into the third ventricle of the rat brain, paradoxically induced the release of growth hormone. A pituitary site of action having been ruled out, this result supports the concept that exogenous somatostatin within the hypothalamus acts either to suppress the release of somatostatin from somatostatin-containing neurons, possibly via an ultrashort-loop feedback mechanism, or to augment release of hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing factor, thereby inducing a release of growth hormone. Injection of somatostatin into the third ventricle also decreased plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, probably by inhibiting the release of luteinizing hormone-releasing factor and thyrotropin-releasing factor.
Long-term memory is thought to be mediated by protein synthesis-dependent, late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP). Two secretory proteins, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have been implicated in this process, but their relationship is unclear. Here we report that tPA, by activating the extracellular protease plasmin, converts the precursor proBDNF to the mature BDNF (mBDNF), and that such conversion is critical for L-LTP expression in mouse hippocampus. Moreover, application of mBDNF is sufficient to rescue L-LTP when protein synthesis is inhibited, which suggests that mBDNF is a key protein synthesis product for L-LTP expression.
The uptake of 45Ca2+ by nerve-ending fractions from brains of mice was inhibited in vitro by 10(-9)M concentrations of beta-endorphin and in mice injected intraventricularly with 7 picomoles of beta-endorphin. That the effect was a specific opiate agonist response of beta-endorphin was demonstrated by use of the opiate antagonist, naloxone, which reversed the action. A role for beta-endorphin in the regulation of calcium flux and neurotransmitter release should be considered.
The relationship between the semantic processing of words and of pictures is a matter of debate among cognitive scientists. We studied the functional anatomy of such processing by using positron-emission tomography (PET). We contrasted activity during two semantic tasks (probing knowledge of associations between concepts, and knowledge of the visual attributes of these concepts) and a baseline task (discrimination of physical stimulus size), performed either with words or with pictures. Modality-specific activations unrelated to semantic processing occurred in the left inferior parietal lobule for words, and the right middle occipital gyrus for pictures. A semantic network common to both words and pictures extended from the left superior occipital gyrus through the middle and inferior temporal cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus. A picture-specific activation related to semantic tasks occurred in the left posterior inferior temporal sulcus, and word-specific activations related to semantic tasks were localized to the left superior temporal sulcus, left anterior middle temporal gyrus, and left inferior frontal sulcus. Thus semantic tasks activate a distributed semantic processing system shared by both words and pictures, with a few specific areas differentially active for either words or pictures.
Accurate binocular depth perception requires information about both stereopsis (relative depth) and distance (absolute depth). It is unclear how these two types of information are integrated in the visual system. In alert, behaving monkeys the responsiveness of a large majority of neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1) was modulated by the viewing distance. This phenomenon affected particularly disparity-related activity and background activity and was not dependent on the pattern of retinal stimulation. Therefore, extraretinal factors, probably related to ocular vergence or accommodation, or both, can affect processing early in the visual pathway. Such modulations could be useful for (i) judging true distance and (ii) scaling retinal disparity to give information about three-dimensional shape.
Although frontal cortex is thought to be important in controlling behavior across long periods of time, most studies of this area concentrate on neuronal responses instantaneously relevant to the current task. In order to investigate the relationship of frontal activity to behavior over longer time periods, we trained rhesus monkeys on a difficult oculomotor task. Their performance fluctuated during the day, and the activity of prefrontal neurons, even measured while the monkeys waited for the targets to appear at the beginning of each set of trials, correlated with performance in a probabilistic rather than a determinist manner: neurons reflected past or predicted future performance, much more than they reflected current performance. We suggest that this activity is related to processes such as arousal or motivation that set the tone for behavior rather than controlling it on a millisecond basis, and could result from ascending pathways that utilize slow, second-messenger synaptic processes.
Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow of normal subjects, while they were discriminating different attributes (shape, color, and velocity) of the same set of visual stimuli. Psychophysical evidence indicated that the sensitivity for discriminating subtle stimulus changes was higher when subjects focused attention on one attribute than when they divided attention among several attributes. Correspondingly, attention enhanced the activity of different regions of extrastriate visual cortex that appear to be specialized for processing information related to the selected attribute.
In everyday life, the successful monitoring of behavior requires continuous updating of the effectiveness of motor acts; one crucial step is becoming aware of the movements one is performing. We studied the anatomical distribution of lesions in right-brain-damaged hemiplegic patients, who obstinately denied their motor impairment, claiming that they could move their paralyzed limbs. Denial was associated with lesions in areas related to the programming of motor acts, particularly Brodmann's premotor areas 6 and 44, motor area 4, and the somatosensory cortex. This association suggests that monitoring systems may be implemented within the same cortical network that is responsible for the primary function that has to be monitored.
It is usually assumed that people are visually aware of at least some of the neuronal activity in the primary visual area, V1, of the neocortex. But the neuroanatomy of the macaque monkey suggests that, although primates may be aware of neural activity in other visual cortical areas, they are not directly aware of that in area V1. There is some psychophysical evidence in humans that supports this hypothesis.
While awake, unanesthetized monkeys held their eyes stationary, a motionless or slowly moving stimulus falling on the receptive field of striate cortex neurons produced an excitatory response. When a rapid eye movement was made across the same stimulus, many of these neurons continued to give an excitatory response. But the discharge of other neurons was unchanged or was suppressed during the eye movement.
GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, where it exerts its effects through ionotropic (GABA(A/C)) receptors to produce fast synaptic inhibition and metabotropic (GABA(B)) receptors to produce slow, prolonged inhibitory signals. The gene encoding a GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R1) has been cloned; however, when expressed in mammalian cells this receptor is retained as an immature glycoprotein on intracellular membranes and exhibits low affinity for agonists compared with the endogenous receptor on brain membranes. Here we report the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a new subtype of the GABAB receptor (GABA(B)R2), which we identified by mining expressed-sequence-tag databases. Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that this new GABA(B)R2-receptor subtype forms heterodimers with GABA(B)R1 through an interaction at their intracellular carboxy-terminal tails. Upon expression with GABA(B)R2 in HEK293T cells, GABA(B)R1 is terminally glycosylated and expressed at the cell surface. Co-expression of the two receptors produces a fully functional GABA(B) receptor at the cell surface; this receptor binds GABA with a high affinity equivalent to that of the endogenous brain receptor. These results indicate that, in vivo, functional brain GABA(B) receptors may be heterodimers composed of GABA(B)R1 and GABA(B)R2.
Partially synchronous 40-Hz oscillations of cortical neurons have been implicated in cognitive function. Specifically, coherence of these oscillations between different parts of the cortex may provide conjunctive properties to solve the 'binding problem': associating features detected by the cortex into unified perceived objects. Here we report an emergent 40-Hz oscillation in networks of inhibitory neurons connected by synapses using GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors in slices of rat hippocampus and neocortex. These network inhibitory postsynaptic potential oscillations occur in response to the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. The oscillations can entrain pyramidal cell discharges. The oscillation frequency is determined both by the net excitation of interneurons and by the kinetics of the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials between them. We propose that interneuron network oscillations, in conjunction with intrinsic membrane resonances and long-loop (such as thalamocortical) interactions, contribute to 40-Hz rhythms in vivo.
Working memory is the process of maintaining an active representation of information so that it is available for use. In monkeys, a prefrontal cortical region important for spatial working memory lies in and around the principal sulcus, but in humans the location, and even the existence, of a region for spatial working memory is in dispute. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans, an area in the superior frontal sulcus was identified that is specialized for spatial working memory. This area is located more superiorly and posteriorly in the human than in the monkey brain, which may explain why it was not recognized previously.
The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) elicits a wide array of physiological effects by binding to several receptor subtypes. The 5-HT2 family of receptors belongs to a large group of seven-transmembrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptors and includes three receptor subtypes (5-HT2A, 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C)) which are linked to phospholipase C, promoting the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and a subsequent increase in the intracellular levels of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol. Here we show that transcripts encoding the 2C subtype of serotonin receptor (5-HT(2C)R) undergo RNA editing events in which genomically encoded adenosine residues are converted to inosines by the action of double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase(s). Sequence analysis of complementary DNA isolates from dissected brain regions have indicated the tissue-specific expression of seven major 5-HT(2C) receptor isoforms encoded by eleven distinct RNA species. Editing of 5-HT(2C)R messenger RNAs alters the amino-acid coding potential of the predicted second intracellular loop of the receptor and can lead to a 10-15-fold reduction in the efficacy of the interaction between receptors and their G proteins. These observations indicate that RNA editing is a new mechanism for regulating serotonergic signal transduction and suggest that this post-transcriptional modification may be critical for modulating the different cellular functions that are mediated by other members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily.
We report the development of a pseudorabies virus that can be used for retrograde tracing from selected neurons. This virus encodes a green fluorescent protein marker and replicates only in neurons that express the Cre recombinase and in neurons in synaptic contact with the originally infected cells. The virus was injected into the arcuate nucleus of mice that express Cre only in those neurons that express neuropeptide Y or the leptin receptor. Sectioning of the brains revealed that these neurons receive inputs from neurons in other regions of the hypothalamus, as well as the amygdala, cortex, and other brain regions. These data suggest that higher cortical centers modulate leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. This method of neural tracing may prove useful in studies of other complex neural circuits.
Altered processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a central event in the formation of amyloid deposits in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. To investigate whether cellular APP processing is controlled by cell-surface neurotransmitter receptors, human embryonic kidney (293) cell lines were transfected with the genes for human brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Stimulation of m1 and m3 receptor subtypes with carbachol increased the basal release of APP derivatives within minutes of treatment, indicating that preexisting APP is released in response to receptor activation. Receptor-activated APP release was blocked by staurosporine, suggesting that protein kinases mediate neurotransmitter receptor-controlled APP processing.
A series of transcription factors critical for maintenance of the neural stem cell state have been identified, but the role of functionally important corepressors in maintenance of the neural stem cell state and early neurogenesis remains unclear. Previous studies have characterized the expression of both SMRT (also known as NCoR2, nuclear receptor co-repressor 2) and NCoR in a variety of developmental systems; however, the specific role of the SMRT corepressor in neurogenesis is still to be determined. Here we report a critical role for SMRT in forebrain development and in maintenance of the neural stem cell state. Analysis of a series of markers in SMRT-gene-deleted mice revealed the functional requirement of SMRT in the actions of both retinoic-acid-dependent and Notch-dependent forebrain development. In isolated cortical progenitor cells, SMRT was critical for preventing retinoic-acid-receptor-dependent induction of differentiation along a neuronal pathway in the absence of any ligand. Our data reveal that SMRT represses expression of the jumonji-domain containing gene JMJD3, a direct retinoic-acid-receptor target that functions as a histone H3 trimethyl K27 demethylase and which is capable of activating specific components of the neurogenic program.
A question of long-standing interest to philosophers, psychologists and neuroscientists is how the brain selects which signals enter consciousness. Binocular rivalry and attention both involve selection of visual stimuli, but affect perception quite differently. During binocular rivalry, awareness alternates between two different stimuli presented to the two eyes. In contrast, attending to one of two different stimuli impairs discrimination of the ignored stimulus, but without causing it to disappear from consciousness. Here we show that despite this difference, attention and rivalry rely on shared object-based selection mechanisms. We cued attention to one of two superimposed transparent surfaces and then deleted the image of one surface from each eye, resulting in rivalry. Observers usually reported seeing only the cued surface. They were also less accurate in judging unpredictable changes in the features of the uncued surface. Our design ensured that selection of the cued surface could not have resulted from spatial, ocular or feature-based mechanisms. Rather, attention was drawn to one surface, and this caused the other surface to be perceptually suppressed during rivalry. These results raise the question of how object representations compete during these two forms of perceptual selection, even as the features of those objects change unpredictably over time.
Sensory information reaches the cerebral cortex through the thalamus, which differentially relays this input depending on the state of arousal. Such 'gating' involves inhibition of the thalamocortical relay neurons by the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We reconstructed the thalamocortical circuit as an artificial and biological hybrid network in vitro. With visual input simulated as retinal cell activity, we show here that when the gain in the thalamic inhibitory feedback loop is greater than a critical value, the circuit tends towards oscillations -- and thus imposes a temporal decorrelation of retinal cell input and thalamic relay output. This results in the functional disconnection of the cortex from the sensory drive, a feature typical of sleep states. Conversely, low gain in the feedback inhibition and the action of noradrenaline, a known modulator of arousal, converge to increase input output correlation in relay neurons. Combining gain control of feedback inhibition and modulation of membrane excitability thus enables thalamic circuits to finely tune the gating of spike transmission from sensory organs to the cortex.
The possibility that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by overexpression or duplication of one or more genes on chromosome 21 has been raised by the observation of AD-like neuropathologic changes in individuals with Down syndrome and by the mapping of both the defect for familial AD and the amyloid beta protein gene to this autosome. Possible duplication on chromosome 21 was investigated in both familial and sporadic AD by means of restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the amyloid and SODI loci, as well as for DNA markers in the vicinity of the familial AD defect and in the critical Down syndrome region of chromosome 21. No evidence of increased DNA dosage was observed in either brain or leukocytes of patients with inherited or sporadic forms of AD. Duplication of these regions is therefore not a frequent event in either form of AD. Furthermore, no significant allelic association was detected between AD and any of the loci, including the amyloid and SODI genes, providing no support for the hypothesis that defects in these specific genes are the primary cause of AD.
These are comments written by the Governing Council of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM), the primary international organization dedicated to neuroimaging research. The purpose of these comments is to identify and frame issues concerning data sharing within the neuroimaging community. Data sharing has become an important issue in most fields of science. The neuroimaging community is no exception, and it clearly perceives potential benefits in such efforts, as have been realized in other fields such as genomics. At the same time, such efforts can be costly (both in time and expense), and there are important factors that differentiate brain imaging from other fields and that pose specific challenges to the generation of useful neuroimaging databases. These include the rapid pace of change in brain imaging technologies; the complexity of the variables that must be specified to meaningfully interpret the results (such as the method of image acquisition, behavioral design, and subject characteristics); and concerns about participant confidentiality. These issues are outlined with the goal of framing and promoting a public discussion of the benefits and risks of data sharing, which can inform the field of neuroimaging as well as others that face similar challenges.
Two types of histamine receptor, the H1- and H2-receptors, are found not only on vascular smooth muscle cells but on the perivascular autonomic nerve terminals. Activation of the prejunctional histamine receptors modifies transmitter release from the nerve terminals. Recently, histamine was shown to inhibit its own release from depolarized slices of rat cerebral cortex. This phenomenon was found to be mediated by a novel class of histamine receptor, the H3-receptor, that was pharmacologically distinct from the H1- and H2-receptors. Up to now, there has been no indication whether this third class of histamine receptor is present in any tissue other than the brain. We report here that histamine depresses sympathetic neurotransmission in the guinea-pig mesenteric artery by interacting with histamine H3-receptors on the perivascular nerve terminals. The pharmacological properties of these receptors are similar to those reported for the H3-receptors in the brain. Our data provide evidence for the existence of H3-receptors in the autonomic nervous system.
During the development of the nervous system, growing axons must traverse considerable distances to find their targets. In insects, this problem is solved in part by pioneer neurons, which lay down the first axonal pathways when distances are at a minimum. Here the existence of a similar kind of neuron in the developing mammalian telencephalon is described. These are the subplate cells, the first postmitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex. Axons from subplate neurons traverse the internal capsule and invade the thalamus early in fetal life, even before the neurons of cortical layers 5 and 6, which will form the adult subcortical projections, are generated. During postnatal life, after the adult pattern of axonal projections is firmly established, most subplate neurons disappear. These observations raise the possibility that the early axonal scaffold formed by subplate cells may prove essential for the establishment of permanent subcortical projections.
The mouse-adapted strain of poliovirus type 2 (Lansing) induces fatal poliomyelitis in mice after intracerebral inoculation, whereas mice inoculated with poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) show no signs of disease. Previous work indicated that the adaptation to mouse virulence is associated with the viral capsid proteins and that mutations in neutralization antigenic site I of poliovirus reduce neurovirulence of the Lansing strain in mice. The role of antigenic site I in mouse neurovirulence was further explored by constructing an antigenic hybrid virus. Six amino acids in antigenic site I of the Mahoney strain were replaced with a sequence specific for the Lansing strain by using a mutagenesis cartridge. The hybrid virus was neutralized by polyclonal antisera elicited by the type 1 and type 2 strains of poliovirus and by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against antigenic site I of type 2 virus. The hybrid virus induced paralytic disease in mice, an observation demonstrating that a short sequence of amino acids in antigenic site I is an important determinant of poliovirus host range. Antigenic site I may be involved in attachment of poliovirus to cells of the mouse central nervous system.
Simulations were performed of layers I and II of olfactory paleocortex, as connected to its primary input structure, olfactory bulb. Induction of synaptic long-term potentiation by means of repetitive sampling of inputs caused the simulation to organize encodings of learned cues into a hierarchical memory that uncovered statistical relationships in the cue environment, corresponding to the performance of hierarchical clustering by the biological network. Simplification led to characterization of those parts of the network responsible for the mechanism, resulting in a novel, efficient algorithm for hierarchical clustering. The hypothesis is put forward that these corticobulbar networks and circuitry of similar design in other brain regions contain computational elements sufficient to construct perceptual hierarchies for use in recognizing environmental cues.
Selective antagonism of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) and noradrenaline transport by antidepressants is a key element in the 'amine' hypothesis of affective disorders. Uptake and/or transport sites of 5HT have been reported to be reduced in platelets of patients suffering from depression and in post-mortem brain samples of depressed patients and suicide victims. To date there has been little molecular information available on the structure and regulation of 5HT transporters. Using the polymerase chain reaction with degenerate oligonucleotides derived from two highly conserved regions of the transporters for noradrenaline and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), we have identified a large family of related gene products expressed in rodent brain. One of these products hybridizes to a single 3.7-kilobase RNA restricted to rat midbrain and brainstem, where it is highly enriched within the serotonergic raphe complex. Transfection with a single 2.3-kilobase brainstem complementary DNA clone is sufficient to confer expression of a Na(+)-dependent 5HT transporter upon nonneural cells, with transport selectively and potently antagonized by 5HT uptake-specific antidepressants, including paroxetine, citalopram and fluoxetine.
Hippocampal neurons provide a population code for location. In young rats, environments are reliably 'mapped' by groups of neurons that have firing locations ('place fields') that can be stable for several months. Old animals exhibit deficits in spatial memory, raising the question of whether the quality or stability of their hippocampal 'cognitive maps' is altered. By recording from large groups of neurons, we observed the hippocampal spatial code to be multistable. In young rats, the place field maps were reliable both within and between episodes in a familiar environment. In old rats, place field maps were accurate and stable during an episode, but frequently exhibited complete rearrangements between episodes. In a spatial memory task, both young and old rats exhibited bimodal performance, consistent with map multistability early in training. However, the performance of young rats became almost unimodal with further training, whereas that of old rats remained markedly bimodal. The multistability of the hippocampal map provides an insight into the dynamics of neural coding in high-level cortical structures and their changes during ageing, and may provide an explanation for the frequent failure of place recognition in elderly humans.
gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. In the cerebral cortex, GABA-containing cells represent a subpopulation of interneurons. With semithin frozen sections, it is possible to demonstrate that most GABA neurons in the rat somatosensory cortex contain the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin and that parvalbumin is found virtually only in GABA neurons. Parvalbumin seems to influence the electrical properties and enzymatic machinery to modulate neuronal excitability and activity. The specific role of parvalbumin in GABA-containing cortical cells may be related to controlling the effectiveness of their inhibitory action.
Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanding polyglutamine repeat in the IT15 or huntingtin gene. Although this gene is widely expressed and is required for normal development, the pathology of HD is restricted to the brain, for reasons that remain poorly understood. The huntingtin gene product is expressed at similar levels in patients and controls, and the genetics of the disorder suggest that the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat induces a toxic gain of function, perhaps through interactions with other cellular proteins. Here we report the identification of a protein (huntingtin-associated protein (HAP)-1) that binds to huntingtin. This binding is enhanced by an expanded polyglutamine repeat, the length of which is also known to correlate with the age of disease onset. The HAP-1 protein is enriched in the brain, suggesting a possible basis for the selective brain pathology of HD.
The auditory brainstem response varies in a circadian rhythm that is negatively correlated with the circadian rhythm in oral temperature. The auditory brainstem responses and oral temperature were recorded every 3 hours from three healthy male subjects during a 2-day period. The data indicate that a reduction of 1 degree C in oral temperature is associated with an increase of 200 microseconds in the latency of wave V of the auditory brainstem response, and of 160 microseconds in the interval between waves I and V.
The rapid antidepressant response after ketamine administration in treatment-resistant depressed patients suggests a possible new approach for treating mood disorders compared to the weeks or months required for standard medications. However, the mechanisms underlying this action of ketamine [a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist] have not been identified. We observed that ketamine rapidly activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, leading to increased synaptic signaling proteins and increased number and function of new spine synapses in the prefrontal cortex of rats. Moreover, blockade of mTOR signaling completely blocked ketamine induction of synaptogenesis and behavioral responses in models of depression. Our results demonstrate that these effects of ketamine are opposite to the synaptic deficits that result from exposure to stress and could contribute to the fast antidepressant actions of ketamine.
In the visual cortex of mammals, response properties of single neurons can be changed by restricted visual experience during early postnatal development. Covering one eye for four to eight hours when kittens are at the peak of the sensitive period is sufficient to weaken the influence of the occluded eye on cortical neurons resulting in a noticeable shift of ocular dominance towards the open eye. The underlying changes in synaptic connections do not occur so readily when a kitten is anaesthetized and paralysed. We report here that an ocular dominance shift is prevented in alert kittens that receive repeated brief monocular exposures when these are followed by ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia. This retrograde effect on cortical plasticity suggests that the process by which synaptic activity is converted into structural changes has been disturbed.
The formation of clusters of altered axons and dendrites surrounding extracellular deposits of amyloid filaments (neuritic plaques) is a major feature of the human brain in both aging and Alzheimer's disease. A panel of antibodies against amyloid filaments and their constituent proteins from humans with Alzheimer's disease cross-reacted with neuritic plaque and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in five other species of aged mammals, including monkey, orangutan, polar bear, and dog. Antibodies to a 28-amino acid peptide representing the partial protein sequence of the human amyloid filaments recognized the cortical and microvascular amyloid of all of the aged mammals examined. Plaque amyloid, plaque neurites, and neuronal cell bodies in the aged animals showed no reaction with antibodies to human paired helical filaments. Thus, with age, the amyloid proteins associated with progressive cortical degeneration in Alzheimer's disease are also deposited in the brains of other mammals. Aged primates can provide biochemically relevant models for principal features of Alzheimer's disease: cerebrovascular amyloidosis and neuritic plaque formation.
A fundamental question about human memory is which brain structures are involved, and when, in transforming experiences into memories. This experiment sought to identify neural correlates of memory formation with the use of intracerebral electrodes implanted in the brains of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded directly from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) as the patients studied single words. ERPs elicited by words subsequently recalled in a memory test were contrasted with ERPs elicited by unrecalled words. Memory formation was associated with distinct but interrelated ERP differences within the rhinal cortex and the hippocampus, which arose after about 300 and 500 milliseconds, respectively. These findings suggest that declarative memory formation is dissociable into subprocesses and sequentially organized within the MTL.
Systemic administration of the neuroleptic drug alpha-flupenthixol attenuated lever-pressing behavior in rats responding for rewarding brain stimulation. The magnitude of this attenuation was dose-dependent and resembled the effects of reward reduction and termination. However, when the operant response requirements of the same rats were changed to nose poking, identical drug treatments produced relatively little attenuation in performance. These data do not support the belief that neuroleptics produce a general state of anhedonia. Rather, the apparent suppression of reinforced behaviors depends at least in part on the kinetic requirements of the response.
A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the human serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been associated with several dimensions of neuroticism and psychopathology, especially anxiety traits, but the predictive value of this genotype against these complex behaviors has been inconsistent. Serotonin [5- hydroxytryptamine, (5-HT)] function influences normal fear as well as pathological anxiety, behaviors critically dependent on the amygdala in animal models and in clinical studies. We now report that individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) promoter polymorphism, which has been associated with reduced 5-HTT expression and function and increased fear and anxiety-related behaviors, exhibit greater amygdala neuronal activity, as assessed by BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging, in response to fearful stimuli compared with individuals homozygous for the long allele. These results demonstrate genetically driven variation in the response of brain regions underlying human emotional behavior and suggest that differential excitability of the amygdala to emotional stimuli may contribute to the increased fear and anxiety typically associated with the short SLC6A4 allele.
Neurons expressing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), found in the septal-preoptic nuclei and hypothalamus, control the release of gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary gland and facilitate reproductive behaviour. LHRH-expressing neurons are also found in the nervus terminalis, a cranial nerve that is a part of the accessory olfactory system and which projects directly from the nose to the septal-preoptic nuclei in the brain. During development, LHRH-immunoreactivity is detected in the peripheral parts of the nervus terminalis before it is found in the brain. Using a combination of LHRH immunocytochemistry and tritiated thymidine autoradiography in fetal mice, we show that LHRH neurons originate in the medial olfactory placode of the developing nose, migrate across the nasal septum and enter the forebrain with the nervus terminalis, arching into the septal-preoptic area and hypothalamus. Clinically, this migratory route for LHRH-expressing neurons could explain the deficiency of gonadotropins seen in 'Kallmann's syndrome' (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with anosmia).
Neurons in the cerebral cortex are organized into anatomical columns, with ensembles of cells arranged from the surface to the white matter. Within a column, neurons often share functional properties, such as selectivity for stimulus orientation; columns with distinct properties, such as different preferred orientations, tile the cortical surface in orderly patterns. This functional architecture was discovered with the relatively sparse sampling of microelectrode recordings. Optical imaging of membrane voltage or metabolic activity elucidated the overall geometry of functional maps, but is averaged over many cells (resolution >100 microm). Consequently, the purity of functional domains and the precision of the borders between them could not be resolved. Here, we labelled thousands of neurons of the visual cortex with a calcium-sensitive indicator in vivo. We then imaged the activity of neuronal populations at single-cell resolution with two-photon microscopy up to a depth of 400 microm. In rat primary visual cortex, neurons had robust orientation selectivity but there was no discernible local structure; neighbouring neurons often responded to different orientations. In area 18 of cat visual cortex, functional maps were organized at a fine scale. Neurons with opposite preferences for stimulus direction were segregated with extraordinary spatial precision in three dimensions, with columnar borders one to two cells wide. These results indicate that cortical maps can be built with single-cell precision.
The steroid anaesthetic Althesin (Glaxo), which is a mixture of two C21 steroids, alphaxalone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnane-11, 20-dione--the active compound) and alphadolone acetate (21-acetoxy-3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnane-11, 20-dione), has been especially useful for the study of forebrain-autonomic and neuroendocrine functions. As determined by the loss of the righting reflex, Child et al. found no sex difference in the anaesthetic dose of Althesin administered intravenously (i.v.). However, in our neuroendocrine studies in which the anaesthetic was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) and at dosage sufficient to produce surgical anaesthesia and analgesia, we observed a sex difference in the efficacy of Althesin. This may explain the difficulties that have been encountered in obtaining adequate anaesthesia (blockade of the somatomotor response to pain) with Althesin. Here we report, using cortical electroencephalography, that Althesin is a more potent anaesthetic than either sodium pentobarbitone or urethane, and that anaesthesia in the male rat requires about four times more Althesin (administered i.p.) than in the female. This sex difference is age dependent, can be abolished by administering oestrogen to the male, does not depend on sexual differentiation of the brain, and cannot be attributed to a sex difference in the metabolic clearance rate of alphaxolone. These results, taken together with those of Richards and Hesketh, suggest that the effect of alphaxalone may be mediated by interactions with synaptic membranes that are more specific than simply a generalized change in membrane structure, and that these interactions are affected by sex steroids.
Box turtles were implanted with thermodes astride the preoptic tissue of the brainstem. The rate of evaporative water loss could be transiently increased by heating the rostral brainstem. Heating tissue in the anterior hypothalamus affected evaporative water loss only a high ambient temperatures. The magnitude of the response was proportional both to the change in hypothalamic temperature and to the ambient temperature with which the turtle was in equilibrium. The major fuction of a high rate of evaporative water loss in turtles is probably to protect the brain from overheating during thermal stress.
Schwann cells in developing and regenerating peripheral nerves express elevated levels of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. Neurotrophins are key mediators of peripheral nervous system myelination. Our results show that myelin formation is inhibited in the absence of functional p75NTR and enhanced by blocking TrkC activity. Moreover, the enhancement of myelin formation by endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor is mediated by the p75NTR receptor, whereas TrkC receptors are responsible for neurotrophin-3 inhibition. Thus p75NTR and TrkC receptors have opposite effects on myelination.
If vision in one eye is blurred or occluded during a critical period in postnatal development, neurons in the visual cortex lose their responses to stimulation through that eye within a few days. Anatomical changes in the nerve terminals that provide input to the visual cortex have previously been observed only after weeks of deprivation, suggesting that synapses become physiologically ineffective before the branches on which they sit are withdrawn. Reconstruction of single geniculocortical axonal arbors in the cat after either brief or prolonged monocular occlusion revealed striking axonal rearrangements in both instances. Rapid withdrawal of the branches of deprived-eye arbors suggests that axonal branches bearing synapses respond quickly to changing patterns of neuronal activity.
The primate visual system is often divided into two channels, designated M and P, whose signals are relayed to the cerebral cortex by neurons in the magnocellular and parvicellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. We have identified a third population of geniculocortical neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of macaques, which is immunoreactive for the alpha subunit of type II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. This large third population occupies interlaminar regions (intercalated layers) ventral to each principal layer. Retrograde labeling of kinase-immunoreactive cells from the primary visual cortex shows that they provide the geniculocortical input to cytochrome oxidase-rich puffs in layers II and III.
The gut-derived hormone ghrelin exerts its effect on the brain by regulating neuronal activity. Ghrelin-induced feeding behaviour is controlled by arcuate nucleus neurons that co-express neuropeptide Y and agouti-related protein (NPY/AgRP neurons). However, the intracellular mechanisms triggered by ghrelin to alter NPY/AgRP neuronal activity are poorly understood. Here we show that ghrelin initiates robust changes in hypothalamic mitochondrial respiration in mice that are dependent on uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Activation of this mitochondrial mechanism is critical for ghrelin-induced mitochondrial proliferation and electric activation of NPY/AgRP neurons, for ghrelin-triggered synaptic plasticity of pro-opiomelanocortin-expressing neurons, and for ghrelin-induced food intake. The UCP2-dependent action of ghrelin on NPY/AgRP neurons is driven by a hypothalamic fatty acid oxidation pathway involving AMPK, CPT1 and free radicals that are scavenged by UCP2. These results reveal a signalling modality connecting mitochondria-mediated effects of G-protein-coupled receptors on neuronal function and associated behaviour.
Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with complementary DNA encoding the RIIA sodium channel alpha subunit from rat brain led to expression of functional sodium channels with the rapid, voltage-dependent activation and inactivation characteristic of sodium channels in brain neurons. The sodium currents mediated by these transfected channels were inhibited by tetrodotoxin, persistently activated by veratridine, and prolonged by Leiurus alpha-scorpion toxin, indicating that neurotoxin receptor sites 1 through 3 were present in functional form. The RIIA sodium channel alpha subunit cDNA alone is sufficient for stable expression of functional sodium channels with the expected kinetic and pharmacological properties in mammalian somatic cells.
Tetrodotoxin (3 x 10(-8) molar) promoted the release of thiamine from perfused rat and frog nerve preparations in a manner similar to other neuroactive drugs. When the rats were injected with thiamine labeled with sulfur-35, analyses of brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve homogenates revealed labeled thiamine in membrane, synaptosomes, and mitochondrial subfractions. However, on incubation of these fractions with tetrodotoxin, thiamine was released only from the membrane fragments.
Ghrelin is an acylated peptide that stimulates the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. Ghrelin-producing neurons are located in the hypothalamus, whereas ghrelin receptors are expressed in various regions of the brain, which is indicative of central-and as yet undefined-physiological functions. Here we show that ghrelin is involved in the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis. Intracerebroventricular injections of ghrelin strongly stimulated feeding in rats and increased body weight gain. Ghrelin also increased feeding in rats that are genetically deficient in growth hormone. Anti-ghrelin immunoglobulin G robustly suppressed feeding. After intracerebroventricular ghrelin administration, Fos protein, a marker of neuronal activation, was found in regions of primary importance in the regulation of feeding, including neuropeptide Y6 (NPY) neurons and agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons. Antibodies and antagonists of NPY and AGRP abolished ghrelin-induced feeding. Ghrelin augmented NPY gene expression and blocked leptin-induced feeding reduction, implying that there is a competitive interaction between ghrelin and leptin in feeding regulation. We conclude that ghrelin is a physiological mediator of feeding, and probably has a function in growth regulation by stimulating feeding and release of growth hormone.
In cats with midsagittal section of the optic chiasm, some visual cortex neurons can be driven not only by the ipsilateral eye, through the direct geniculocortical pathways, but also by the contralateral eye, through the opposite visual cortex and corpus callosum. The receptive fields and the response characteristics observed upon stimulation of the contralateral eye are very similar to those observed upon stimulation of the ipsilateral eye; the two monocular receptive fields of a given cell lie in corresponding points of heteronymous halves of the visual field in close contact with the vertical meridian, thus adding in visual space and forming a binocular receptive area which crosses the vertical meridian and extends equally on either side of it.
Cortical columns generate separate streams of information that are distributed to numerous cortical and subcortical brain regions. We asked whether local intracortical circuits reflect these different processing streams by testing whether the intracortical connectivity among pyramidal neurons reflects their long-range axonal targets. We recorded simultaneously from up to four retrogradely labelled pyramidal neurons that projected to the superior colliculus, the contralateral striatum or the contralateral cortex to assess their synaptic connectivity. Here we show that the probability of synaptic connection depends on the functional identities of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. We first found that the frequency of monosynaptic connections among corticostriatal pyramidal neurons is significantly higher than among corticocortical or corticotectal pyramidal neurons. We then show that the probability of feed-forward connections from corticocortical neurons to corticotectal neurons is approximately three- to fourfold higher than the probability of monosynaptic connections among corticocortical or corticotectal cells. Moreover, we found that the average axodendritic overlap of the presynaptic and postsynaptic pyramidal neurons could not fully explain the differences in connection probability that we observed. The selective synaptic interactions we describe demonstrate that the organization of local networks of pyramidal cells reflects the long-range targets of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons.
The distribution of catecholamine varicosities within the brainstem reticular formation of the immature cat was determined by means of the formaldehyde-induced fluorescence technique. A continuous pattern of intense, green, medium-sized varicosities exists at nearly all brainstem levels. At most of these levels the varicosities appear within the boundaries of reticular formation nuclei. However, in rostral mesencephalon, some of the varicosities of the pattern lie in proximity to perikarya of the red nucleus. In addition, numerous varicosities in caudal medulla appear to extend from the pattern into nonreticular formation nuclei. A comparable pattern of reticular formation fluorescence is absent in the rat and this finding is believed to represent a true interspecies difference.
Increased discharge activity of mesopontine cholinergic neurons participates in the production of electroencephalographic (EEG) arousal; such arousal diminishes as a function of the duration of prior wakefulness or of brain hyperthermia. Whole-cell and extracellular recordings in a brainstem slice show that mesopontine cholinergic neurons are under the tonic inhibitory control of endogenous adenosine, a neuromodulator released during brain metabolism. This inhibitory tone is mediated postsynaptically by an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance and by an inhibition of the hyperpolarization-activated current. These data provide a coupling mechanism linking neuronal control of EEG arousal with the effects of prior wakefulness, brain hyperthermia, and the use of the adenosine receptor blockers caffeine and theophylline.
Adrenalectomy of adult male rats resulted in a nearly complete loss of hippocampal granule cells 3 to 4 months after surgery. Nissl and immunocytochemical staining of hippocampal neurons revealed that the granule cell loss was selective; there was no apparent loss of hippocampal pyramidal cells or of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-, somatostatin-, neuropeptide Y-, calcium binding protein-, or parvalbumin-containing hippocampal interneurons. The hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells of adrenalectomized animals exhibited normal electrophysiological responses to afferent stimulation, whereas responses evoked in the dentate gyrus were severely attenuated. Corticosterone replacement prevented both the adrenalectomy-induced granule cell loss and the attenuated physiological response. Thus, the adrenal glands play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the normal adult brain.
Cognitive and motor deficits are now recognized as significant clinical features of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Juvenile rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were found to exhibit cognitive and motor deficits characteristic of HIV infection. Impairment on a motor skill task was the most reliable indicator of infection. Various cognitive impairments were also evident. These deficits were related to SIV infection of the brain but not to inflammatory lesions at a particular locus. The results suggest that the SIV-infected rhesus macaque is a valuable model for understanding the cause of HIV-associated central nervous system dysfunction and for developing a treatment.
Patients with lesions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of the brain, which includes the hippocampus, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, are severely impaired in their ability to remember and recognize words or faces which they saw only a short time ago. These lesions also prevent the effect of word repetition on cortical event-related potentials that are associated with these tasks. We have been able to study the response of individual neurons in the human medial temporal lobe to such delayed recognition tasks in epileptic patients undergoing neurosurgery. We found that some MTL neurons preferentially fired on sight of one particular word from a set of ten words used in a memory task, and others fired in response to one particular face. This stimulus-specific firing was maximal during the time that the neocortical event potentials are most sensitive to stimulus repetition, suggesting that the MTL contributes specific information to the cortex during the retrieval of recent memories.
The cerebellar flocculus has been implicated in vestibulo-oculomotor control. One major central input to this structure originates from brainstem cells in the paramedian tract (PMT), whose function is unknown. Here it is reported that PMT cells in the pons carry vestibular and eye movement signals and their pharmacological inactivation produces a leaky integrator combined with vestibular imbalance. The results suggest that PMT cells provide the cerebellum with sensory and motor signals that are essential for velocity-to-position integration, a common premotor process that is required in all motor systems.
After intravenous injection, cytochrome c does not enter the cerebrospinal fluid. In most areas of the brain, the marker is prevented from leaving cerebral vessels by the capillary endothelium. In the choroid plexus, the marker passes freely out of capillaries into the extracellular space. However, it does not traverse tight junctions between epithelial cells and is rapidly incorporated into mnembrane-bound vesicles within the cell cytoplasm. Thereafter, cytochrome c is apparently removed by lysosomal degradation. These data suggest that there are at least two morphologically distinct blood-brain barriers to cytochrome c and that pinocytosis may be a mechanism for intracellular degradation rather than transcellular transport.
The cholinergic system plays a crucial role in learning and memory. Lesions of cholinergic nuclei, pharmacological manipulations of cholinergic systems, intracerebral transplantation of fetal tissue and anatomical changes in cholinergic pathways during ageing have all been correlated with altered cognitive behaviour. However, it has not been proved that regional acetylcholine is causally required for learning and memory. Here we describe how we achieved a permanent and selective impairment of learning and memory by damaging the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, a nucleus that provides the major cholinergic innervation of the neocortex, in adult rats. To test the hypothesis that acetylcholine is essential for restoration of cognitive function, we implanted genetically modified cells that produce acetylcholine into denervated neocortical target regions. After grafting, rats with increased neocortical acetylcholine levels showed a significant improvement in a spatial navigation task. Acetylcholine is thus not only necessary for learning and memory, as previously argued, but its presence within the neocortex is also sufficient to ameliorate learning deficits and restore memory following damage to the nucleus basalis.
The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multi-ligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules, interacts with distinct molecules implicated in homeostasis, development and inflammation, and certain diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Engagement of RAGE by a ligand triggers activation of key cell signalling pathways, such as p21ras, MAP kinases, NF-kappaB and cdc42/rac, thereby reprogramming cellular properties. RAGE is a central cell surface receptor for amphoterin, a polypeptide linked to outgrowth of cultured cortical neurons derived from developing brain. Indeed, the co-localization of RAGE and amphoterin at the leading edge of advancing neurites indicated their potential contribution to cellular migration, and in pathologies such as tumour invasion. Here we demonstrate that blockade of RAGE-amphoterin decreased growth and metastases of both implanted tumours and tumours developing spontaneously in susceptible mice. Inhibition of the RAGE-amphoterin interaction suppressed activation of p44/p42, p38 and SAP/JNK MAP kinases; molecular effector mechanisms importantly linked to tumour proliferation, invasion and expression of matrix metalloproteinases.
The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.
Rats made phenylketonuric by a diet containing high levels of either phenylalanine alone, or phenylalanine and tyrosine, show a marked reduction in total cerebral stores of serotonin. Evidence from studies both in vitro and in vivo indicates that an important mechanism of this impairment in the metabolism of serotonin is the inhibition by high levels of these amino acids of the active transport of the precursor of serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, into brain.
The primary visual cortex (area 17) of the Old World monkey is divided into alternating right- and left-eye dominance columns that are highly modifiable by visual experience during a critical period in development but display little morphological or physiological plasticity during adult life. However, changes in immunocytochemical staining for a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase occur in visual cortical neurones of adult monkeys after brief monocular deprivation and concentrations of putative neurotransmitters or their related enzymes can be altered with changes in neuronal activity in other systems. We therefore examined the effects of monocular deprivation on the immunocytochemical staining for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its synthetic enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), in adult monkey area 17. The staining for GABA and GAD in neuronal somata and terminals was markedly reduced within ocular dominance columns associated with a removed or a visually deprived eye, suggesting that the GABA concentration in cortical neurones may depend on their levels of activity. Thus area 17 of adult monkeys may retain a greater degree of plasticity than previously recognized and sensory experience can profoundly affect transmitter levels, in the cortex, apparently by regulating levels of a synthetic enzyme.
In seven right-handed adults, the brain electrical patterns before accurate performance differed from the patterns before inaccurate performance. Activity overlying the left frontal cortex and the motor and parietal cortices contralateral to the performing hand preceded accurate left- or right-hand performance. Additional strong activity overlying midline motor and premotor cortices preceded left-hand performance. These measurements suggest that brief, spatially distributed neural activity patterns, or "preparatory sets," in distinct cognitive, somesthetic-motor, and integrative motor areas of the human brain may be essential precursors of accurate visuomotor performance.
The amyloid proteins isolated from neuritic plaques and the cerebrovasculature of Alzheimer's disease are self-aggregating moieties termed A4 protein and beta-protein, respectively. A putative A4 amyloid precursor (herein termed A4(695] has been characterized by analysis of a human brain complementary DNA. We report here the sequence of a closely related amyloid cDNA, A4(751), distinguished from A4(695) by the presence of a 168 base-pair (bp) sequence which adds 57 amino acids to, and removes one residue from, the predicted A4(695) protein. The peptide predicted from this insert is very similar to the Kunitz family of serine proteinase inhibitors. The two A4-specific messenger RNAs are differentially expressed: in a limited survey, A4(751) mRNA appears to be ubiquitous, whereas A4(695) mRNA has a restricted pattern of expression which includes cells from neuronal tissue. These data may have significant implications for understanding amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease.
The concept that astrocytes release neuroactive molecules (gliotransmitters) to affect synaptic transmission has been a paradigm shift in neuroscience research over the past decade. This concept suggests that astrocytes, together with pre- and postsynaptic neuronal elements, make up a functional synapse. Astrocyte release of gliotransmitters (for example, glutamate and adenosine triphosphate) is generally accepted to be a Ca2+-dependent process. We used two mouse lines to either selectively increase or obliterate astrocytic Gq G protein-coupled receptor Ca2+ signaling to further test the hypothesis that astrocytes release gliotransmitters in a Ca2+-dependent manner to affect synaptic transmission. Neither increasing nor obliterating astrocytic Ca2+ fluxes affects spontaneous and evoked excitatory synaptic transmission or synaptic plasticity. Our findings suggest that, at least in the hippocampus, the mechanisms of gliotransmission need to be reconsidered.
Within the Hoxb homeobox gene complex, Hoxb-1 is the earliest member expressed in the mesoderm and neuroectoderm of primitive streak and presomite embryos, preceding rhombomere-restricted expression in the hindbrain. Ectopic exposure of embryos to retinoic acid alters spatial aspects of Hox gene expression patterns. However, the role of retinoids in regulating these genes during normal development is unclear. We have now identified two enhancers, 3' of the mouse Hoxb-1 gene, which together reconstruct the early endogenous expression pattern and mediate the early ectopic response to retinoic acid. Furthermore, these regions are functionally conserved in both chicken and pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) Hoxb-1 genes. The enhancer that controls the retinoic acid response, and regulates expression predominantly in neuroectoderm, contains a retinoic acid response element (RARE). Point mutations in the RARE abolish expression in neuroectoderm. Therefore, this RARE is not only involved in the ectopic response to retinoic acid, but is also essential for establishing aspects of the early Hoxb-1 expression pattern.
To elucidate molecular, cellular, and circuit changes that occur in the brain during learning, we investigated the role of a glutamate receptor subtype in fear conditioning. In this form of learning, animals associate two stimuli, such as a tone and a shock. Here we report that fear conditioning drives AMPA-type glutamate receptors into the synapse of a large fraction of postsynaptic neurons in the lateral amygdala, a brain structure essential for this learning process. Furthermore, memory was reduced if AMPA receptor synaptic incorporation was blocked in as few as 10 to 20% of lateral amygdala neurons. Thus, the encoding of memories in the lateral amygdala is mediated by AMPA receptor trafficking, is widely distributed, and displays little redundancy.
When different images are presented to the two eyes, they compete for perceptual dominance, such that one image is visible while the other is suppressed. This binocular rivalry is thought to reflect competition between monocular neurons within the primary visual cortex. However, neurons whose activity correlates with perception during rivalry are found mainly in higher cortical areas, and respond to input from both eyes. Thus rivalry may involve competition between alternative perceptual interpretations at a higher level of analysis. To investigate this, we tested the effect of rapidly alternating the rival stimuli between the two eyes. Under these conditions, the perceptual alternations exhibit the same temporal dynamics as with static patterns, and a single phase of perceptual dominance can span multiple alternations of the stimuli. Thus neural representations of the two stimuli compete for visual awareness independently of the eye through which they reach the higher visual areas. This finding places binocular rivalry in the general category of multistable phenomena, such as ambiguous figures, and provides a new way to study the neural cause and resolution of perceptual ambiguities.
Conventional approaches to understanding consciousness are generally concerned with the contribution of specific brain areas or groups of neurons. By contrast, it is considered here what kinds of neural processes can account for key properties of conscious experience. Applying measures of neural integration and complexity, together with an analysis of extensive neurological data, leads to a testable proposal-the dynamic core hypothesis-about the properties of the neural substrate of consciousness.
Optical imaging of cortical activity offers several advantages over conventional electrophysiological and anatomical techniques. One can map a relatively large region, obtain successive maps to different stimuli in the same cortical area and follow variations in response over time. In the intact mammalian brain this imaging has been accomplished with the aid of voltage sensitive dyes. However, it has been known for many years that some intrinsic changes in the optical properties of the tissue are dependent on electrical or metabolic activity. Here we show that these changes can be used to study the functional architecture of cortex. Optical maps of whisker barrels in the rat and the orientation columns in the cat visual cortex, obtained by reflection measurements of the intrinsic signal, were confirmed with voltage sensitive dyes or by electrophysiological recordings. In addition, we describe an intrinsic signal originating from small arteries which can be used to investigate the communication between local neuronal activity and the microvasculature. One advantage of the method is that it is non-invasive and does not require dyes, a clear benefit for clinical applications.
The identification of neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs) by in vivo brain imaging could have important implications for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. We describe a metabolic biomarker for the detection and quantification of NPCs in the human brain in vivo. We used proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify and characterize a biomarker in which NPCs are enriched and demonstrated its use as a reference for monitoring neurogenesis. To detect low concentrations of NPCs in vivo, we developed a signal processing method that enabled the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the analysis of the NPC biomarker in both the rodent brain and the hippocampus of live humans. Our findings thus open the possibility of investigating the role of NPCs and neurogenesis in a wide variety of human brain disorders.
Actions performed by others may have different relevance for the observer, and thus lead to different behavioral responses, depending on the regions of space in which they are executed. We found that in rhesus monkeys, the premotor cortex neurons activated by both the execution and the observation of motor acts (mirror neurons) are differentially modulated by the location in space of the observed motor acts relative to the monkey, with about half of them preferring either the monkey's peripersonal or extrapersonal space. A portion of these spatially selective mirror neurons encode space according to a metric representation, whereas other neurons encode space in operational terms, changing their properties according to the possibility that the monkey will interact with the object. These results suggest that a set of mirror neurons encodes the observed motor acts not only for action understanding, but also to analyze such acts in terms of features that are relevant to generating appropriate behaviors.
The role of experience in the development of the cerebral cortex has long been controversial. Patterned visual experience in the cat begins when the eyes open about a week after birth. Cortical maps for orientation and ocular dominance in the primary visual cortex of cats were found to be present by 2 weeks. Early pattern vision appeared unimportant because these cortical maps developed identically until nearly 3 weeks of age, whether or not the eyes were open. The naive maps were powerfully dominated by the contralateral eye, and experience was needed for responses to the other eye to become strong, a process unlikely to be strictly Hebbian. With continued visual deprivation, responses to both eyes deteriorated, with a time course parallel to the well-known critical period of cortical plasticity. The basic structure of cortical maps is therefore innate, but experience is essential for specific features of these maps, as well as for maintaining the responsiveness and selectivity of cortical neurons.
The tonotopic organization of brainstem auditory nuclei was compared in embryonic and hatchling chickens. In embryos, neurons at any given position in these nuclei were maximally sensitive to lower frequency sounds than the best frequency after hatching. This finding indicates that neurons are maximally stimulated by sounds of different frequencies as development proceeds and supports the hypothesis that during development there is a change in the spatial encoding of frequency along the cochlea.
This experiment examined the effects on memory of various amnestic treatments in animals earlier treated with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine (PBZ). Thirty minutes before being trained in a one-trial inhibitory (passive) avoidance task, animals received an injection of PBZ or saline. Immediately after training, each animal received one of the following amnestic treatments: stimulation of the frontal cortex or amygdala, pentylenetetrazol, diethyldithiocarbamate, or cycloheximide. In control animals, each treatment produced retrograde amnesia. However, PBZ-treated animals did not develop amnesia. These findings suggest that there may be a common neurobiological mechanism underlying the amnesias produced by many treatments.
Nerve cells in the monkey's prefrontal cortex and nucleus medialis dorsalis of the thalamus show changes of firing frequency associated with the performance of a delayed response test. Most cells increase firing during the cue presentation period or at the beginning of the ensuing delay; spike discharge highler than that in intertrial periods is present in some cells throughout the delay. These changes are interpreted as suggestive evidence of a role of frontothalamic circuits in the attentive process involved in short-term memory
The drug, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), depletes striatal dopamine levels in primates and certain rodents, including mice, and produces parkinsonian-like symptoms in humans and nonhuman primates. To investigate the consequences of grafting adrenal medullary tissue into the brain of a rodent model of Parkinson's disease, a piece of adult mouse adrenal medulla was grafted unilaterally into mouse striatum 1 week after MPTP treatment. This MPTP treatment resulted in the virtual disappearance of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers and severely depleted striatal dopamine levels. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after grafting, dense tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers were observed in the grafted striatum, while only sparse fibers were seen in the contralateral striatum. In all cases, tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers appeared to be from the host rather than from the grafts, which survived poorly. These observations suggest that, in mice, adrenal medullary grafts exert a neurotrophic action in the host brain to enhance recovery of dopaminergic neurons. This effect may be relevant to the symptomatic recovery in Parkinson's disease patients who have received adrenal medullary grafts.
Inbred tht strains Fischer 344 (F344) and Buffalo (BUF) differ in serveral physiological and behavioral measures. It was found that the activity of adrenomedullary and regional brain phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase is at least four times higher in F344 rats than in BUF rats; these strain-dependent differences corresponded directly with the epinephrine content of the medulla-pons and hypothalamus. Conversely, alpha-adrenergic receptor density in brain regions containing phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase is two to three times lower in F344 rats than in BUF rats; alpha-receptors in frontal cortex (a brain region lacking phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity and epinephrine) are similar in both strains. These findings suggest that strain-dependent differences in alpha-receptors are regulated by inherited differences in presynaptic adrenergic neuronal function in different brain regions.
Computer models based on the detailed biology of the brain can help us understand the myriad complexities of human cognition and intelligence. Here, we review models of the higher level aspects of human intelligence, which depend critically on the prefrontal cortex and associated subcortical areas. The picture emerging from a convergence of detailed mechanistic models and more abstract functional models represents a synthesis between analog and digital forms of computation. Specifically, the need for robust active maintenance and rapid updating of information in the prefrontal cortex appears to be satisfied by bistable activation states and dynamic gating mechanisms. These mechanisms are fundamental to digital computers and may be critical for the distinctive aspects of human intelligence.
Spontaneous cortical activity--ongoing activity in the absence of intentional sensory input--has been studied extensively, using methods ranging from EEG (electroencephalography), through voltage sensitive dye imaging, down to recordings from single neurons. Ongoing cortical activity has been shown to play a critical role in development, and must also be essential for processing sensory perception, because it modulates stimulus-evoked activity, and is correlated with behaviour. Yet its role in the processing of external information and its relationship to internal representations of sensory attributes remains unknown. Using voltage sensitive dye imaging, we previously established a close link between ongoing activity in the visual cortex of anaesthetized cats and the spontaneous firing of a single neuron. Here we report that such activity encompasses a set of dynamically switching cortical states, many of which correspond closely to orientation maps. When such an orientation state emerged spontaneously, it spanned several hypercolumns and was often followed by a state corresponding to a proximal orientation. We suggest that dynamically switching cortical states could represent the brain's internal context, and therefore reflect or influence memory, perception and behaviour.
Neurogenesis occurs in the olfactory system of the adult brain throughout life, in both invertebrates and vertebrates, but its physiological regulation is not understood. We show that the production of neuronal progenitors is stimulated in the forebrain subventricular zone of female mice during pregnancy and that this effect is mediated by the hormone prolactin. The progenitors then migrate to produce new olfactory interneurons, a process likely to be important for maternal behavior, because olfactory discrimination is critical for recognition and rearing of offspring. Neurogenesis occurs even in females that mate with sterile males. These findings imply that forebrain olfactory neurogenesis may contribute to adaptive behaviors in mating and pregnancy.
The motions of overlapping contours in a visual scene may arise from the physical motion(s) of either a single or multiple surface(s). A central problem facing the visual motion system is that of assigning the most likely interpretation. The rules underlying this perceptual decision can be explored using a visual stimulus formed by superimposing two moving gratings. The resultant percept is either that of a single coherently moving 'plaid pattern' (coherent motion) or of the two component gratings sliding noncoherently across one another (noncoherent motion). When plaid patterns are configured to mimic one transparent grating overlying another, the percept of noncoherent motion dominates. We now report that neurons in the visual cortex of rhesus monkeys exhibit changes in direction tuning that parallel this perceptual phenomenon: sensitivity to the motions of the component gratings is enhanced under conditions that favour the perception of noncoherent motion. These results challenge models of cortical visual processing that fail to take into account the contribution of figural image segmentation cues to the analysis of visual motion.
Systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is neurotoxic to cerebral dopaminergic neurones in several animal species, and can cause parkinsonism in man. The mechanism of this action may be indirect. MPTP is oxidized in the brain to a pyridinium species, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+)6. This oxidation is greatly decreased by inhibition of monoamine oxidase B6, as are the biochemical effects of MPTP in the mouse and its neurotoxicity in the monkey. We now show that MPP+ exerts a powerful neurotoxic action on the nigrostriatal dopamine system of the rodent.
Our current understanding of spatial behaviour and parietal lobe function is largely based on the belief that spatial neglect in humans (a lack of awareness of space on the side of the body contralateral to a brain injury) is typically associated with lesions of the posterior parietal lobe. However, in monkeys, this disorder is observed after lesions of the superior temporal cortex, a puzzling discrepancy between the species. Here we show that, contrary to the widely accepted view, the superior temporal cortex is the neural substrate of spatial neglect in humans, as it is in monkeys. Unlike the monkey brain, spatial awareness in humans is a function largely confined to the right superior temporal cortex, a location topographically reminiscent of that for language on the left. Hence, the decisive phylogenetic transition from monkey to human brain seems to be a restriction of a formerly bilateral function to the right side, rather than a shift from the temporal to the parietal lobe. One may speculate that this lateralization of spatial awareness parallels the emergence of an elaborate representation for language on the left side.
Programmed cell death (apoptosis) occurs during normal development of the central nervous system. However, the mechanisms that determine which neurons will succumb to apoptosis are poorly understood. Blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors for only a few hours during late fetal or early neonatal life triggered widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain, suggesting that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, acting at NMDA receptors, controls neuronal survival. These findings may have relevance to human neurodevelopmental disorders involving prenatal (drug-abusing mothers) or postnatal (pediatric anesthesia) exposure to drugs that block NMDA receptors.
A positive relation was found between the amount of eye movement during rapid-eye-movement or paradoxical sleep and estimates of intellectual level in a group of retarded adults. This result supports the hypothesis that during sleep the brain carries out processes important for cognitive function.
Current thinking about long-term memory in the cortex is focused on changes in the strengths of connections between neurons. But ongoing structural plasticity in the adult brain, including synapse formation/elimination and remodelling of axons and dendrites, suggests that memory could also depend on learning-induced changes in the cortical 'wiring diagram'. Given that the cortex is sparsely connected, wiring plasticity could provide a substantial boost in storage capacity, although at a cost of more elaborate biological machinery and slower learning.
Electrical stimulation of certain hypothalamic regions in cats and rodents can elicit attack behaviour, but the exact location of relevant cells within these regions, their requirement for naturally occurring aggression and their relationship to mating circuits have not been clear. Genetic methods for neural circuit manipulation in mice provide a potentially powerful approach to this problem, but brain-stimulation-evoked aggression has never been demonstrated in this species. Here we show that optogenetic, but not electrical, stimulation of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral subdivision (VMHvl) causes male mice to attack both females and inanimate objects, as well as males. Pharmacogenetic silencing of VMHvl reversibly inhibits inter-male aggression. Immediate early gene analysis and single unit recordings from VMHvl during social interactions reveal overlapping but distinct neuronal subpopulations involved in fighting and mating. Neurons activated during attack are inhibited during mating, suggesting a potential neural substrate for competition between these opponent social behaviours.
Adrenal steroids bind specifically to hippocampal neurons under normal conditions and may contribute to hippocampal cell loss during aging, but little is known about the neurophysiological mechanisms by which they may change hippocampal cell functions. In the present studies, adrenal steroids have been shown to modulate a well-defined membrane conductance in hippocampal pyramidal cells. The calcium-dependent slow afterhyperpolarization is reduced in hippocampal slices from adrenalectomized rats, and it is increased after in vivo or in vitro administration of the adrenal steroid, corticosterone. Calcium action potentials are also reduced in adrenalectomized animals, indicating that the primary effect of corticosteroids may be on calcium conductance. The afterhyperpolarization component reduced by adrenalectomy is greater in aged rats than in young rats, suggesting that, with aging, there is an increased effect of corticosteroids on some calcium-mediated brain processes. Because elevated concentrations of intracellular calcium can be cytotoxic, these observations may increase the understanding of glucocorticoid involvement in brain aging as well as of the normal functions of these steroids in the brain.
The prefrontal cortex is a higher brain region that regulates thought, behavior, and emotion using representational knowledge, operations often referred to as working memory. We tested the influence of protein kinase C (PKC) intracellular signaling on prefrontal cortical cognitive function and showed that high levels of PKC activity in prefrontal cortex, as seen for example during stress exposure, markedly impair behavioral and electrophysiological measures of working memory. These data suggest that excessive PKC activation can disrupt prefrontal cortical regulation of behavior and thought, possibly contributing to signs of prefrontal cortical dysfunction such as distractibility, impaired judgment, impulsivity, and thought disorder.
From birth to day 21, rat offspring received daily injections of naltrexone at a dosage that blocked morphine-induced analgesia 24 hours a day. At 21 days, body, brain, and cerebellar weights of naltrexone-injected animals were 18, 11, and 5 percent greater than corresponding control weights. In addition, morphometric analysis of the cerebrum revealed a somatosensory cortex that was 18 percent thicker than that of the controls. The cerebellum of naltrexone-treated rats was 41 percent larger in total area and contained at least 70 percent more glial cells and 30 percent more granule neurons. Neurons derived prenatally were unaffected by drug treatment. These results show that naltrexone can stimulate body and brain growth in rats and suggest a role for the endorphin and opiate receptor system in development.
As the human life span increases, the number of people suffering from cognitive decline is rising dramatically. The mechanisms underlying age-associated memory impairment are, however, not understood. Here we show that memory disturbances in the aging brain of the mouse are associated with altered hippocampal chromatin plasticity. During learning, aged mice display a specific deregulation of histone H4 lysine 12 (H4K12) acetylation and fail to initiate a hippocampal gene expression program associated with memory consolidation. Restoration of physiological H4K12 acetylation reinstates the expression of learning-induced genes and leads to the recovery of cognitive abilities. Our data suggest that deregulated H4K12 acetylation may represent an early biomarker of an impaired genome-environment interaction in the aging mouse brain.
The long-standing rationalist tradition in moral psychology emphasizes the role of reason in moral judgment. A more recent trend places increased emphasis on emotion. Although both reason and emotion are likely to play important roles in moral judgment, relatively little is known about their neural correlates, the nature of their interaction, and the factors that modulate their respective behavioral influences in the context of moral judgment. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using moral dilemmas as probes, we apply the methods of cognitive neuroscience to the study of moral judgment. We argue that moral dilemmas vary systematically in the extent to which they engage emotional processing and that these variations in emotional engagement influence moral judgment. These results may shed light on some puzzling patterns in moral judgment observed by contemporary philosophers.
Some animals have larger brains than others, but it is not yet known why. Species differences in life-style, including dietary habits and patterns of development of the young, are associated with variation in brain weight, independently of the effects of body weight and evolutionary history. Taken together with behavioral and neuroanatomical analyses, these studies begin to suggest the evolutionary pressures that favor different sized brains and brain components.
The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a serine-threonine kinase that regulates cell-cycle progression and growth by sensing changes in energy status. We demonstrated that mTOR signaling plays a role in the brain mechanisms that respond to nutrient availability, regulating energy balance. In the rat, mTOR signaling is controlled by energy status in specific regions of the hypothalamus and colocalizes with neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Central administration of leucine increases hypothalamic mTOR signaling and decreases food intake and body weight. The hormone leptin increases hypothalamic mTOR activity, and the inhibition of mTOR signaling blunts leptin's anorectic effect. Thus, mTOR is a cellular fuel sensor whose hypothalamic activity is directly tied to the regulation of energy intake.
Dynamic spatial patterns of correlation of electrical potentials recorded from the human brain were shown in diagrams generated by mathematical pattern recognition. The patterns for "move" and "no-move" variants of a brief visuospatial task were compared. In the interval spanning the P300 peak of the evoked potential, higher correlations of the right parietal electrode with occipital and central electrodes distinguished the no-move task from the move task. In the next interval, spanning the readiness potential in the move task, higher correlations of the left central electrode with occipital and frontal electrodes characterized the move task. These results conform to neuropsychological expectations of localized processing and their temporal sequence. The rapid change in the side and site of localized processes may account for conflicting reports of lateralization in studies which lacked adequate spatial and temporal resolution.
With spontaneous activity as a measure of arousal, dose response curves were established for scopolamine and amphetamine administered to 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 100-day-old rats. Amphetamine always increased activity, but scopolamine had no efect on younger rats, which suggests that adrenergic excitatory areas in the brainstem mature more rapidly than cholinergic inhibitory areas in the forebrain.
The subventricular zone (SVZ) is a principal source of adult neural stem cells in the rodent brain, generating thousands of olfactory bulb neurons every day. If the adult human brain contains a comparable germinal region, this could have considerable implications for future neuroregenerative therapy. Stem cells have been isolated from the human brain, but the identity, organization and function of adult neural stem cells in the human SVZ are unknown. Here we describe a ribbon of SVZ astrocytes lining the lateral ventricles of the adult human brain that proliferate in vivo and behave as multipotent progenitor cells in vitro. This astrocytic ribbon has not been observed in other vertebrates studied. Unexpectedly, we find no evidence of chains of migrating neuroblasts in the SVZ or in the pathway to the olfactory bulb. Our work identifies SVZ astrocytes as neural stem cells in a niche of unique organization in the adult human brain.
Intraoperative electrical stimulation, which temporarily inactivates restricted regions during brain surgery, can map cognitive functions in humans with spatiotemporal resolution unmatched by other methods. Using this technique, we found that stimulation of the right inferior parietal lobule or the caudal superior temporal gyrus, but not of its rostral portion, determined rightward deviations on line bisection. However, the strongest shifts occurred with subcortical stimulation. Fiber tracking identified the stimulated site as a section of the superior occipitofrontal fasciculus, a poorly known parietal-frontal pathway. These findings suggest that parietal-frontal communication is necessary for the symmetrical processing of the visual scene.
Receptive fields of sensory cortical neurons are plastic, changing in response to alterations of neural activity or sensory experience. In this way, cortical representations of the sensory environment can incorporate new information about the world, depending on the relevance or value of particular stimuli. Neuromodulation is required for cortical plasticity, but it is uncertain how subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as the cholinergic nucleus basalis, interact with and refine cortical circuits. Here we determine the dynamics of synaptic receptive field plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex (also known as AI) using in vivo whole-cell recording. Pairing sensory stimulation with nucleus basalis activation shifted the preferred stimuli of cortical neurons by inducing a rapid reduction of synaptic inhibition within seconds, which was followed by a large increase in excitation, both specific to the paired stimulus. Although nucleus basalis was stimulated only for a few minutes, reorganization of synaptic tuning curves progressed for hours thereafter: inhibition slowly increased in an activity-dependent manner to rebalance the persistent enhancement of excitation, leading to a retuned receptive field with new preference for the paired stimulus. This restricted period of disinhibition may be a fundamental mechanism for receptive field plasticity, and could serve as a memory trace for stimuli or episodes that have acquired new behavioural significance.
Neuropeptides may have functions in the central nervous system (CNS) other than altering neuronal excitability. For example, they may act as regulators of brain metabolism by affecting glycogenolysis. Since it has been suggested that glial cells might provide metabolic support for neuronal activity, they may well be one of the targets for neuropeptide regulation of metabolism. Consistent with this view are reports that peptide-containing nerve terminals have been seen apposed to astrocytes, but it is also quite possible that peptides could act at sites lacking morphological specialization. Primary cultures containing CNS glial cells have been shown to respond to beta-adrenergic agonists with an increase in cyclic AMP and, as a result, with an increase in glycogenolysis and have also been shown to respond to a variety of peptides with changes in cyclic AMP. In the study reported here, we have examined the effects of several peptides on relatively pure cultures of rat astrocytes. We demonstrate that the increase in intracellular cyclic AMP induced by noradrenaline is markedly enhanced by somatostatin and substance P and is inhibited by enkephalin, even though these peptides on their own have little or no effect on the basal levels of cyclic AMP. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on the other hand increases cyclic AMP in the absence of noradrenaline. These results suggest that neuropeptides influence glial cells as well as neurones in the CNS and, in the case of somatostatin and substance P, provide further examples of neuropeptides modulating the response to another chemical signal without having a detectable action on their own.
It is self-evident that the adult mammalian brain and spinal cord do not regenerate after injury, but recent discoveries have forced a reconsideration of this accepted principle. Advances in our understanding of how the brain develops have provided a rough blueprint for how we may bring about regeneration in the damaged brain. Studies in developmental neurobiology, intracellular signalling and neuroimmunology are bringing the regeneration field closer to success. Notwithstanding these advances, clear and indisputable evidence for adult functional regeneration remains to be shown.
The autosomal recessive mouse mutation reeler leads to impaired motor coordination, tremors and ataxia. Neurons in affected mice fail to reach their correct locations in the developing brain, disrupting the organization of the cerebellar and cerebral cortices and other laminated regions. Here we use a previously characterized reeler allele (rl(tg)) to close a gene, reelin, deleted in two reeler alleles. Normal but not mutant mice express reelin in embryonic and postnatal neurons during periods of neuronal migration. The encoded protein resembles extracellular matrix proteins involved in cell adhesion. The reeler phenotype thus seems to reflect a failure of early events associated with brain lamination which are normally controlled by reelin.
The neural substrate subserving magnetic orientation is largely unknown in vertebrates and unstudied in mammals. We combined a behavioral test for magnetic compass orientation in mole rats and immunocytochemical visualization of the transcription factor c-Fos as a marker of neuronal activity. We found that the superior colliculus of the Zambian mole rat (Cryptomys anselli) contains neurons that are responsive to magnetic stimuli. These neurons are directionally selective and organized within a discrete sublayer. Our results constitute evidence for the involvement of a specific mammalian brain structure in magnetoreception.
There are three distinct enolase isoenzymes in brain; neuron-specific enolase (NSE), formerly referred to as neuron-specific protein, which is specifically localized in neurons, a nonneuronal enolase (NNE), and a third hybrid form. Light microscopy with immunocytochemical techniques has permitted localization of non-neuronal enolase. The NNE is located in glial cells with no staining of endothelial cells or neurons. Thus, NSE and NNE can be used as specific metabolic markers for neurons and glial cells, respectively.
A popular hypothesis in the social sciences is that humans have social preferences to reduce inequality in outcome distributions because it has a negative impact on their experienced reward. Although there is a large body of behavioural and anthropological evidence consistent with the predictions of these theories, there is no direct neural evidence for the existence of inequality-averse preferences. Such evidence would be especially useful because some behaviours that are consistent with a dislike for unequal outcomes could also be explained by concerns for social image or reciprocity, which do not require a direct aversion towards inequality. Here we use functional MRI to test directly for the existence of inequality-averse social preferences in the human brain. Inequality was created by recruiting pairs of subjects and giving one of them a large monetary endowment. While both subjects evaluated further monetary transfers from the experimenter to themselves and to the other participant, we measured neural responses in the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, two areas that have been shown to be involved in the valuation of monetary and primary rewards in both social and non-social contexts. Consistent with inequality-averse models of social preferences, we find that activity in these areas was more responsive to transfers to others than to self in the 'high-pay' subject, whereas the activity of the 'low-pay' subject showed the opposite pattern. These results provide direct evidence for the validity of this class of models, and also show that the brain's reward circuitry is sensitive to both advantageous and disadvantageous inequality.
Messenger RNAs isolated from adult or newborn rat spinal cord were fractionated in a sucrose gradient. The fractions were injected into Xenopus oocytes to determine their potencies for expression of glycine receptors (GlyRs), which were then examined electrophysiologically. The sedimentation profiles disclosed two classes of GlyR mRNAs, one heavy and the other light. The adult spinal cord was rich in heavy GlyR mRNA, whereas the light GlyR mRNA was more abundant in neonatal spinal cord and in adult cerebral cortex. Glycine receptors encoded by heavy and light mRNAs of adult spinal cord showed some electrophysiological differences. Thus there are two types of GlyRs encoded by mRNAs of different sizes, and the expression of these mRNAs is developmentally regulated. A tissue- and age-dependent distribution of heterogeneous GlyR mRNAs may imply diverse roles of the GlyRs in neuronal function in the central nervous system.
The finding of neurogenesis in the adult brain led to the discovery of adult neural stem cells. TLX was initially identified as an orphan nuclear receptor expressed in vertebrate forebrains and is highly expressed in the adult brain. The brains of TLX-null mice have been reported to have no obvious defects during embryogenesis; however, mature mice suffer from retinopathies, severe limbic defects, aggressiveness, reduced copulation and progressively violent behaviour. Here we show that TLX maintains adult neural stem cells in an undifferentiated, proliferative state. We show that TLX-expressing cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from adult brains can proliferate, self-renew and differentiate into all neural cell types in vitro. By contrast, TLX-null cells isolated from adult mutant brains fail to proliferate. Reintroducing TLX into FACS-sorted TLX-null cells rescues their ability to proliferate and to self-renew. In vivo, TLX mutant mice show a loss of cell proliferation and reduced labelling of nestin in neurogenic areas in the adult brain. TLX can silence glia-specific expression of the astrocyte marker GFAP in neural stem cells, suggesting that transcriptional repression may be crucial in maintaining the undifferentiated state of these cells.
The concept of a hypothalamic neurohumoral control for anterior pituitary secretion postulates the existence of a growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) of neuronal origin that stimulates the pituitary gland to release growth hormone (GH). Such a compound has not yet been isolated and characterized from the brain, although there is extensive physiological and biochemical evidence for its existence (reviewed in ref. 2). However, a 44-amino-acid amidated peptide having the physiological properties of GRF as well as chemical similarities was recently isolated from a human pancreatic tumour that had caused acromegaly. Two shorter biologically active fragments of 40 and 37 residues were also isolated. The synthetic replicates of these human pancreas GRF (hpGRF) peptides specifically stimulate GH release in vitro and in vivo. Assuming similarity or identity between the putative hypothalamic GRF and the tumour-derived hpGRF, we have used immunohistochemistry to search for hpGRF-like immunoreactivity in the brain. We report here that antisera against the hpGRF1-40 peptide specifically stain neuronal cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus of the primate hypothalamus, with fibres projecting to the median eminence and ending in contact with portal vessels. This topography is characteristic of a neuronal system elaborating a releasing factor. These results provide evidence that hypothalamic GRF is very similar, if not identical, to hpGRF.
Stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus in rats resulted in increased plasma growth hormone levels within 5 minutes, as measured by radioimmunoassay. Stimulation of the cerebral cortex was without effect. These observations confirm previous results involving destructive lesions and establish the ventromedial nucleus as a hypothalamic locus involved in the control of growth hormone secretion.
Understanding how neural activity in sensory cortices relates to perception is a central theme of neuroscience. Action potentials of sensory cortical neurons can be strongly correlated to properties of sensory stimuli and reflect the subjective judgements of an individual about stimuli. Microstimulation experiments have established a direct link from sensory activity to behaviour, suggesting that small neuronal populations can influence sensory decisions. However, microstimulation does not allow identification and quantification of the stimulated cellular elements. The sensory impact of individual cortical neurons therefore remains unknown. Here we show that stimulation of single neurons in somatosensory cortex affects behavioural responses in a detection task. We trained rats to respond to microstimulation of barrel cortex at low current intensities. We then initiated short trains of action potentials in single neurons by juxtacellular stimulation. Animals responded significantly more often in single-cell stimulation trials than in catch trials without stimulation. Stimulation effects varied greatly between cells, and on average in 5% of trials a response was induced. Whereas stimulation of putative excitatory neurons led to weak biases towards responding, stimulation of putative inhibitory neurons led to more variable and stronger sensory effects. Reaction times for single-cell stimulation were long and variable. Our results demonstrate that single neuron activity can cause a change in the animal's detection behaviour, suggesting a much sparser cortical code for sensations than previously anticipated.
In the mammalian cortex, it is generally assumed that the output information of neurons is encoded in the number and the timing of action potentials. Here, we show, by using direct patchclamp recordings from presynaptic hippocampal mossy fiber boutons, that axons transmit analog signals in addition to action potentials. Excitatory presynaptic potentials result from subthreshold dendritic synaptic inputs, which propagate several hundreds of micrometers along the axon and modulate action potential-evoked transmitter release at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse. This combined analog and action potential coding represents an additional mechanism for information transmission in a major hippocampal pathway.
Can we decipher speech content ("what" is being said) and speaker identity ("who" is saying it) from observations of brain activity of a listener? Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging with a data-mining algorithm and retrieve what and whom a person is listening to from the neural fingerprints that speech and voice signals elicit in the listener's auditory cortex. These cortical fingerprints are spatially distributed and insensitive to acoustic variations of the input so as to permit the brain-based recognition of learned speech from unknown speakers and of learned voices from previously unheard utterances. Our findings unravel the detailed cortical layout and computational properties of the neural populations at the basis of human speech recognition and speaker identification.
Parietal and premotor cortex regions are serious contenders for bringing motor intentions and motor responses into awareness. We used electrical stimulation in seven patients undergoing awake brain surgery. Stimulating the right inferior parietal regions triggered a strong intention and desire to move the contralateral hand, arm, or foot, whereas stimulating the left inferior parietal region provoked the intention to move the lips and to talk. When stimulation intensity was increased in parietal areas, participants believed they had really performed these movements, although no electromyographic activity was detected. Stimulation of the premotor region triggered overt mouth and contralateral limb movements. Yet, patients firmly denied that they had moved. Conscious intention and motor awareness thus arise from increased parietal activity before movement execution.
The release of glutamate during brain anoxia or ischaemia triggers the death of neurons, causing mental or physical handicap. The mechanism of glutamate release is controversial, however. Four release mechanisms have been postulated: vesicular release dependent on external calcium or Ca2+ released from intracellular stores; release through swelling-activated anion channels; an indomethacin-sensitive process in astrocytes; and reversed operation of glutamate transporters. Here we have mimicked severe ischaemia in hippocampal slices and monitored glutamate release as a receptor-gated current in the CA1 pyramidal cells that are killed preferentially in ischaemic hippocampus. Using blockers of the different release mechanisms, we demonstrate that glutamate release is largely by reversed operation of neuronal glutamate transporters, and that it plays a key role in generating the anoxic depolarization that abolishes information processing in the central nervous system a few minutes after the start of ischaemia. A mathematical model incorporating K+ channels, reversible uptake carriers and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor channels reproduces the main features of the response to ischaemia. Thus, transporter-mediated glutamate homeostasis fails dramatically in ischaemia: instead of removing extracellular glutamate to protect neurons, transporters release glutamate, triggering neuronal death.
A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the brain. The principal component of amyloid fibrils is beta/A4 amyloid protein, which can be generated by the aberrant processing of a large membrane-bound glycoprotein, the beta/A4 amyloid protein precursor (APP)3. To test whether overexpression of APP generates abnormally processed derivatives that affect the viability of neurons, we stably transfected full-length human APP complementary DNA into murine embryonal carcinoma P19 cells. These cells differentiate into post-mitotic neurons and astrocytes after exposure to retinoic acid. When differentiation of the APP cDNA-transfected P19 cells was induced, all neurons showed severe degenerative changes and disappeared within a few days. The degenerating neurons contained large amounts of APP derivatives that were truncated at the amino terminus and encompassed the entire beta/A4 domain. These results suggest that post-mitotic neurons are vulnerable to overexpressed APP, which undergoes aberrant processing to generate potentially amyloidogenic fragments.
Blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging uses alterations in brain hemodynamics to infer changes in neural activity. Are these hemodynamic changes regulated at a spatial scale capable of resolving functional columns within the cerebral cortex? To address this question, we made simultaneous measurements of tissue oxygenation and single-cell neural activity within the visual cortex. Results showed that increases in neuronal spike rate were accompanied by immediate decreases in tissue oxygenation. We used this decrease in tissue oxygenation to predict the orientation selectivity and ocular dominance of neighboring neurons. Our results establish a coupling between neural activity and oxidative metabolism and suggest that high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging may be used to localize neural activity at a columnar level.
Most antianxiety drugs (anxiolytics) work by modulating neurotransmitters in the brain. Benzodiazepines are fast and effective anxiolytic drugs; however, their long-term use is limited by the development of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Ligands of the translocator protein [18 kilodaltons (kD)] may promote the synthesis of endogenous neurosteroids, which also exert anxiolytic effects in animal models. Here, we found that the translocator protein (18 kD) ligand XBD173 enhanced gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurotransmission and counteracted induced panic attacks in rodents in the absence of sedation and tolerance development. XBD173 also exerted antipanic activity in humans and, in contrast to benzodiazepines, did not cause sedation or withdrawal symptoms. Thus, translocator protein (18 kD) ligands are promising candidates for fast-acting anxiolytic drugs with less severe side effects than benzodiazepines.
Our capacity to process and respond behaviourally to multiple incoming stimuli is very limited. To optimize the use of this limited capacity, attentional mechanisms give priority to behaviourally relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant distractors. In visual areas, attended stimuli induce enhanced responses and an improved synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma frequency band (40-70 Hz). Both effects probably improve the neuronal signalling of attended stimuli within and among brain areas. Attention also results in improved behavioural performance and shortened reaction times. However, it is not known how reaction times are related to either response strength or gamma-band synchronization in visual areas. Here we show that behavioural response times to a stimulus change can be predicted specifically by the degree of gamma-band synchronization among those neurons in monkey visual area V4 that are activated by the behaviourally relevant stimulus. When there are two visual stimuli and monkeys have to detect a change in one stimulus while ignoring the other, their reactions are fastest when the relevant stimulus induces strong gamma-band synchronization before and after the change in stimulus. This enhanced gamma-band synchronization is also followed by shorter neuronal response latencies on the fast trials. Conversely, the monkeys' reactions are slowest when gamma-band synchronization is high in response to the irrelevant distractor. Thus, enhanced neuronal gamma-band synchronization and shortened neuronal response latencies to an attended stimulus seem to have direct effects on visually triggered behaviour, reflecting an early neuronal correlate of efficient visuo-motor integration.
Tetrahydropapaveroline (THP), a dopamine-dopaldehyde condensation product, was delivered directly into the cerebral ventricle of rats automatically every 15 minutes for 12 days. The animals were given access to both water and ethylalcohol, the latter being presented in 12 concentrations from 3 to 30 percent. Within 3 to 6 days of the start of the infusion of THP, the rats, which normally rejected alcohol, drank alcohol solutions in increasingly excessive amounts; this was accompanied by symptoms that were similar to those of withdrawal and intoxication. These results provide evidence that an abnormal metabolite in the brain may produce the addictive state caused by alcoholic beverages.
Using an immunocytochemical method for the localization of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), we have observed GABAergic nerve terminals distributed throughout all layers of normal monkey sensorimotor cortex. These terminals displayed ultrastructural characteristics that suggested that they arose from aspinous and sparsely spinous stellate neurons. In monkeys (Macaca mulatta and M. fascicularis) made epileptic by cortical application of alumina gel, a highly significant numerical decrease of GAD-positive nerve terminals occurred at sites of seizure foci indicating a functional loss of GABAergic inhibitory synapses. A loss of such inhibition at seizure foci could lead to epileptic activity of cortical pyramidal neurons.
Most natural actions are chosen voluntarily from many possible choices. An action is often chosen based on the reward that it is expected to produce. What kind of cellular activity in which area of the cerebral cortex is involved in selecting an action according to the expected reward value? Results of an analysis in monkeys of cellular activity during the performance of reward-based motor selection and the effects of chemical inactivation are presented. We suggest that cells in the rostral cingulate motor area, one of the higher order motor areas in the cortex, play a part in processing the reward information for motor selection.
Sustained exposure to glucocorticoids, the adrenocortical stress hormones, is toxic to neurons, and such toxicity appears to play a role in neuron loss during aging. Previous work has shown that glucocorticoids compromise the capacity of neurons to survive a variety of metabolic insults. This report extends those observations by showing that ischemic injury to neurons in rat brain is also potentiated by exposure to high physiological titers of glucocorticoids and is attenuated by adrenalectomy. The synergy between ischemic and glucocorticoid brain injury was seen even when glucocorticoid levels were manipulated after the ischemic insult. Pharmacological interventions that diminish the adrenocortical stress response may improve neurological outcome from stroke or cardiac arrest.
To generate behaviour, the brain must transform sensory information into signals that are appropriate to control movement. Sensory and motor coordinate frames are fundamentally different, however: sensory coordinates are based on the spatiotemporal patterns of activity arising from the various sense organs, whereas motor coordinates are based on the pulling directions of muscles or groups of muscles. Results from psychophysical experiments suggest that in the process of transforming sensory information into motor control signals, the brain encodes movements in abstract or extrinsic coordinate frames, that is ones not closely related to the geometry of the sensory apparatus or of the skeletomusculature. Here we show that an abstract code underlies movements of the head by the barn owl. Specifically, the data show that subsequent to the retinotopic code for space in the optic tectum yet before the motor neuron code for muscle tensions there exists a code for head movement in which upward, downward, leftward and rightward components of movement are controlled by four functionally distinct neural circuits. Such independent coding of orthogonal components of movement may be a common intermediate step in the transformation of sensation into behaviour.
The activity of single neurons in precentral cortex of unanesthetized monkeys (Macaca mulatta) was conditioned by reinforcing high rates of neuronal discharge with delivery of a food pellet. Auditory or visual feedback of unit firing rates was usually provided in addition to food reinforcement. After several training sessions, monkeys could increase the activity of newly isolated cells by 50 to 500 percent above rates before reinforcement.
The potential utility of cultured neuroblastoma cells as donor tissue for neutral implants into the mammalian brain has been examined. Cells from a human neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32, were labeled with [3H]thymidine and chemically rendered amitotic. These differentiated IMR-32 cells were grafted into the hippocampi of five adult African Green monkeys, and graft survival was evaluated for up to 270 days after transplantation. Autoradiographically labeled grafted cells were identified in four animals. Processes from grafted cells could be followed for distances of up to 150 micrometers into the host brain. No evidence for neoplastic growth of the transplant was found. Thus, grafted neuroblastoma cells can survive for prolonged periods in the primate brain and may serve as a practical source of donor tissue for neural implants.
One of the major limitations in the use of genetically modified mice for studying cognitive functions is the lack of regional and temporal control of gene function. To overcome these limitations, a forebrain-specific promoter was combined with the tetracycline transactivator system to achieve both regional and temporal control of transgene expression. Expression of an activated calcium-independent form of calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) resulted in a loss of hippocampal long-term potentiation in response to 10-hertz stimulation and a deficit in spatial memory, a form of explicit memory. Suppression of transgene expression reversed both the physiological and the memory deficit. When the transgene was expressed at high levels in the lateral amygdala and the striatum but not other forebrain structures, there was a deficit in fear conditioning, an implicit memory task, that also was reversible. Thus, the CaMKII signaling pathway is critical for both explicit and implicit memory storage, in a manner that is independent of its potential role in development.
Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a lasting enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission that follows specific patterns of electrical stimulation. Although the mechanism of LTP has been intensively studied, particularly in the hippocampus, its significance for normal brain function remains unproven. It has been proposed that LTP-like mechanisms may contribute to naturally occurring, experience-dependent synaptic modifications in the visual cortex. The formation of normal binocular connections within the visual cortex requires simultaneous input from both eyes during a postnatal critical period that can be delayed by rearing animals in complete darkness. To explore the role of LTP in this experience-dependent maturation process, we induced LTP in visual cortical slices taken at different ages from light-reared and dark-reared rats. Susceptibility to LTP coincides with the critical period and, like the critical period, can be prolonged by rearing animals in darkness. These findings support the hypothesis that LTP reflects a normal mechanism of experience-dependent synaptic modification in the developing mammalian brain.
Gold-filled Sendai virus envelopes were fused with cell suspensions from the basal forebrain of fetal rat donors, and the resulting gold-labeled cells were transplanted into the neocortex of adult rat recipients. Not only did large numbers of labeled cells remain intact through 3 months in the neocortex, but sizable numbers migrated subcortically to the recipient's lesioned nucleus basalis region (a distance of 4 to 5 millimeters). Since this technique is capable of labeling most transplanted cells for long periods of time, it may be useful in determining the survival, migration, and connectivity of intracerebrally transplanted tissues.
Intraperitoneal injection of monosodium glutamate in neonatal rates resulted in a 90 percent loss of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic areas of the brain, whereas the amount of hormone in the pituitary gland did not change. The dramatic reduction of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the brain suggests that is primary source there is the neuronal perikarya of the arcuate nucleus.
Until now, neurobiologists have had little luck in finding the matchmakers of nerve cell connections, called synapses, in the brain. In today's issue of Cell, researchers report that a single protein can apparently trigger synapse formation between brain neurons isolated from mice and grown in culture. If the finding is borne out in living animals, it could provide fresh insights into how the brain is wired during embryonic development and might eventually provide new ways to enhance or at least maintain synapse formation in the brains of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.
Cortical population coding could in principle rely on either the mean rate of neuronal action potentials, or the relative timing of action potentials, or both. When a single sensory stimulus drives many neurons to fire at elevated rates, the spikes of these neurons become tightly synchronized, which could be involved in 'binding' together individual firing-rate feature representations into a unified object percept. Here we demonstrate that the relative timing of cortical action potentials can signal stimulus features themselves, a function even more basic than feature grouping. Populations of neurons in the primary auditory cortex can coordinate the relative timing of their action potentials such that spikes occur closer together in time during continuous stimuli. In this way cortical neurons can signal stimuli even when their firing rates do not change. Population coding based on relative spike timing can systemically signal stimulus features, it is topographically mapped, and it follows the stimulus time course even where mean firing rate does not.
Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) respond differently to a simple visual element presented in isolation from when it is embedded within a complex image. This difference, a specific modulation by surrounding elements in the image, is mediated by short- and long-range connections within V1 and by feedback from other areas. Here we study the role of short-range connections in this process, and relate it to the layout of local inhomogeneities in the cortical maps of orientation and space. By measuring correlation between neuron pairs located in optically imaged maps of V1 orientation columns we show that the strength of local connections between cells is a graded function of lateral separation across cortex, largely radially symmetrical and relatively independent of orientation preferences. We then show the contextual influence of flanking visual elements on neuronal responses varies systematically with a neuron's position within the cortical orientation map. The strength of this contextual influence on a neuron can be predicted from a model of local connections based on simple overlap with particular features of the orientation map. This indicates that local intracortical circuitry could endow neurons with a graded specialization for processing angular visual features such as corners and T junctions, and this specialization could have its own functional cortical map, linked with the orientation map.
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) mediate ischemic brain damage but also mediate essential neuronal excitation. To treat stroke without blocking NMDARs, we transduced neurons with peptides that disrupted the interaction of NMDARs with the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95. This procedure dissociated NMDARs from downstream neurotoxic signaling without blocking synaptic activity or calcium influx. The peptides, when applied either before or 1 hour after an insult, protected cultured neurons from excitotoxicity, reduced focal ischemic brain damage in rats, and improved their neurological function. This approach circumvents the negative consequences associated with blocking NMDARs and may constitute a practical stroke therapy.
Dopamine-containing neurons of the mammalian midbrain are required for normal behavior and movements. In vivo they fire action potentials in bursts, but in vitro they discharge regularly spaced action potentials. Burst firing in vitro has now been shown to be robustly induced by the glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) although not by the non-NMDA agonists kainate or quisqualate. The hyperpolarization between bursts of action potentials results from electrogenic sodium ion extrusion by a ouabain-sensitive pump. This mechanism of burst generation in mammalian neurons may be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.
Changes in gene regulation likely influenced the profound phenotypic divergence of humans from other mammals, but the extent of adaptive substitution in human regulatory sequences remains unknown. We identified 992 conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) with a significant excess of human-specific substitutions. These accelerated elements were disproportionately found near genes involved in neuronal cell adhesion. To assess the uniqueness of human noncoding evolution, we examined CNSs accelerated in chimpanzee and mouse. Although we observed a similar enrichment near neuronal adhesion genes in chimpanzee, the accelerated CNSs themselves exhibited almost no overlap with those in human, suggesting independent evolution toward different neuronal phenotypes in each species. CNSs accelerated in mouse showed no bias toward neuronal cell adhesion. Our results indicate that widespread cis-regulatory changes in human evolution may have contributed to uniquely human features of brain development and function.
The human brain localizes mental operations of the kind posited by cognitive theories. These local computations are integrated in the performance of cognitive tasks such as reading. To support this general hypothesis, new data from neural imaging studies of word reading are related to results of studies on normal subjects and patients with lesions. Further support comes from studies in mental imagery, timing, and memory.
After systemic administration to immature rodents, L-cysteine destroys neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and striatum, but the underlying mechanism has never been clarified. This neurotoxicity of L-cysteine, in vitro or in vivo, has now been shown to be mediated primarily through the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor (with quisqualate receptor participation at higher concentrations). In addition, the excitotoxic potency of L-cysteine was substantially increased in the presence of physiological concentrations of bicarbonate ion. L-Cysteine is naturally present in the human brain and in the environment, and is much more powerful than beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine, a bicarbonate-dependent excitotoxin, which has been implicated in an adult neurodegenerative disorder endemic to Guam. Thus, the potential involvement of this common sulfur-containing amino acid in neurodegenerative processes affecting the central nervous system warrants consideration.
Systematic changes in neuronal connections have been observed during the development of many vertebrate neuronal systems. These changes have usually involved a refinement from an initial exuberance of connections or a response to some experimental perturbation. Here we report on a system of neuronal connections, which, during a protracted developmental period, undergo ordered changes in response to normally occurring changes in functional requirements. In the frog Xenopus laevis, interocular alignment changes markedly during late larval and post-metamorphic life, producing a progressive enlargement of the binocular portion of the visual field. An intertectal system links the two mid-brain optic tecta and is concerned with the neural representation of binocular visual space. In the adult animal, connections in this system link corresponding points (points receiving information from one locus of binocular visual space) on the two tecta. Changes in eye position with development, however, change the set of corresponding points. Therefore, if the intertectal connections link corresponding tectal points throughout development, they must undergo an ordered change with time. We present electrophysiological evidence that the intertectal connections do, indeed, undergo such changes in response to changes in eye alignment, and that the changes are major.
A prominent feature of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases is accumulation of misfolded protein in vulnerable neurons. When levels of misfolded protein overwhelm degradative pathways, the result is cellular toxicity and neurodegeneration. Cellular mechanisms for degrading misfolded protein include the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the main non-lysosomal degradative pathway for ubiquitinated proteins, and autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradative pathway. The UPS and autophagy have long been viewed as complementary degradation systems with no point of intersection. This view has been challenged by two observations suggesting an apparent interaction: impairment of the UPS induces autophagy in vitro, and conditional knockout of autophagy in the mouse brain leads to neurodegeneration with ubiquitin-positive pathology. It is not known whether autophagy is strictly a parallel degradation system, or whether it is a compensatory degradation system when the UPS is impaired; furthermore, if there is a compensatory interaction between these systems, the molecular link is not known. Here we show that autophagy acts as a compensatory degradation system when the UPS is impaired in Drosophila melanogaster, and that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a microtubule-associated deacetylase that interacts with polyubiquitinated proteins, is an essential mechanistic link in this compensatory interaction. We found that compensatory autophagy was induced in response to mutations affecting the proteasome and in response to UPS impairment in a fly model of the neurodegenerative disease spinobulbar muscular atrophy. Autophagy compensated for impaired UPS function in an HDAC6-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression of HDAC6 was sufficient to rescue degeneration associated with UPS dysfunction in vivo in an autophagy-dependent manner. This study suggests that impairment of autophagy (for example, associated with ageing or genetic variation) might predispose to neurodegeneration. Morover, these findings suggest that it may be possible to intervene in neurodegeneration by augmenting HDAC6 to enhance autophagy.
Two rhesus monkeys, exposed continuously to realistic patterns and levels of noise for 9 months, exhibited sustained elevations in blood pressure that did not return to baseline values after the noise ended. Auditory brainstem responses, measured before and after exposure, indicated no change in auditory sensitivity.
In cats under halothane or methoxyflurane, iontophoretic applications of choline are only eight times weaker than applications of acetylcholine in evoking firing of neurons in the sensorimotor region of the cerebral cortex. The action of choline is suppressed by atropine but not by two agents that block choline uptake (hemicholinium-3 and triethylcholine), and is not potentiated by an anticholinesterase (physostigmine). Choline therefore appears to excite cortical neurons by a direct action, which may be a significant component of its beneficial therapeutic effects.
Sex steroid hormones and catecholamines have physiological interactions in the brain. By the combined use of autoradiography and fluorescence histochemistry, steroid hormone target sites and catecholamine neurons were visualized simultaneously in the same tissue preparation. By this dual localization method, [3H]estradiol and [3H]dihydrotestosterone target sites were identified in nuclei of many catecholamine cell bodies in the brainstem, and catecholamine nerve terminals were observed near certain steroid hormone target neurons. These results suggest close anatomical interrelations between steroid hormone sites of action and catecholamine sites of production and action in the brain.
Although the H2 subclass of histamine receptor has been revealed by classical pharmacological approaches, the direct identification of this adenylate cyclase-linked receptor has, despite much effort, remained elusive. Initial studies using 3H-metiamide and 3H-histamine and, subsequently, work from our own laboratory and others using 3H-cimetidine and 3H-ranitidine in various tissues, has shown the unsuitability of these ligands for labelling the H2 receptor. We report here our results using 3H-tiotidine, a more potent H2-antagonist than either cimetidine or ranitidine, and show that this ligand meets the criteria for labeling the H2 receptor in guinea pig cerebral cortex membranes.
In cultures of hippocampal neurons, induction of long-term synaptic potentiation or depression by repetitive synaptic activity is accompanied by a retrograde spread of potentiation or depression, respectively, from the site of induction at the axonal outputs to the input synapses on the dendrites of the presynaptic neuron. We report here that rapid retrograde synaptic modification also exists in an intact developing retinotectal system. Local application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to the Xenopus laevis optic tectum, which induced persistent potentiation of retinotectal synapses, led to a rapid modification of synaptic inputs at the dendrites of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), as shown by a persistent enhancement of light-evoked excitatory synaptic currents and spiking activity of RGCs. This retrograde effect required TrkB receptor activation, phospholipase Cgamma activity and Ca2+ elevation in RGCs, and was accounted for by a selective increase in the number of postsynaptic AMPA-subtype glutamate receptors at RGC dendrites. Such retrograde information flow in the neuron allows rapid regulation of synaptic inputs at the dendrite in accordance to signals received at axon terminals, a process reminiscent of back-propagation algorithm for learning in neural networks.
Developmental dyslexia is characterized by a severe reading problem in people who have normal intelligence and schooling. Impaired reading of alphabetic scripts is associated with dysfunction of left temporoparietal brain regions. These regions perform phonemic analysis and conversion of written symbols to phonological units of speech (grapheme-to-phoneme conversion); two central cognitive processes that mediate reading acquisition. Furthermore, it has been assumed that, in contrast to cultural diversities, dyslexia in different languages has a universal biological origin. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging with reading-impaired Chinese children and associated controls, that functional disruption of the left middle frontal gyrus is associated with impaired reading of the Chinese language (a logographic rather than alphabetic writing system). Reading impairment in Chinese is manifested by two deficits: one relating to the conversion of graphic form (orthography) to syllable, and the other concerning orthography-to-semantics mapping. Both of these processes are critically mediated by the left middle frontal gyrus, which functions as a centre for fluent Chinese reading that coordinates and integrates various information about written characters in verbal and spatial working memory. This finding provides an insight into the fundamental pathophysiology of dyslexia by suggesting that rather than having a universal origin, the biological abnormality of impaired reading is dependent on culture.
The prefrontal cortex is essential for the temporal integration of sensory information in behavioural and linguistic sequences. Such information is commonly encoded in more than one sense modality, notably sight and sound. Connections from sensory cortices to the prefrontal cortex support its integrative function. Here we present the first evidence that prefrontal cortex cells associate visual and auditory stimuli across time. We gave monkeys the task of remembering a tone of a certain pitch for 10 s and then choosing the colour associated with it. In this task, prefrontal cortex cells responded selectively to tones, and most of them also responded to colours according to the task rule. Thus, their reaction to a tone was correlated with their subsequent reaction to the associated colour. This correlation faltered in trials ending in behavioural error. We conclude that prefrontal cortex neurons are part of integrative networks that represent behaviourally meaningful cross-modal associations. The orderly and timely activation of neurons in such networks is crucial for the temporal transfer of information in the structuring of behaviour, reasoning and language.
Local paroxysmal discharges of epileptic tissue within the human brain, which may be electrically recorded as voltage spikes in the electroencephalogram, also generate extracranial magnetic fields. These fields were assessed by means of recently developed neuromagnetometric techniques. Surface measurements of magnetic spike field strength in the region of the focus appear sufficient to establish the location, depth, orientation, and polarity of currents underlying the paroxysmal discharge.
The sensation and perception of smell (olfaction) are largely dependent on sniffing, which is an active stage of stimulus transport and therefore an integral component of mammalian olfaction. Electrophysiological data obtained from study of the hedgehog, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey indicate that sniffing (whether or not an odorant is present) induces an oscillation of activity in the olfactory bulb, driving the piriform cortex in the temporal lobe, in other words, the piriform is driven by the olfactory bulb at the frequency of sniffing. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that is dependent on the level of oxygen in the blood to determine whether sniffing can induce activation in the piriform of humans, and whether this activation can be differentiated from activation induced by an odorant. We find that sniffing, whether odorant is present or absent, induces activation primarily in the piriform cortex of the temporal lobe and in the medial and posterior orbito-frontal gyri of the frontal lobe. The source of the sniff-induced activation is the somatosensory stimulation that is induced by air flow through the nostrils. In contrast, a smell, regardless of sniffing, induces activation mainly in the lateral and anterior orbito-frontal gyri of the frontal lobe. The dissociation between regions activated by olfactory exploration (sniffing) and regions activated by olfactory content (smell) shows a distinction in brain organization in terms of human olfaction.
X-irradiation administered in single doses of 10 to 40 r has a widespread effect on the developing rat brain. It first diminishes the formation of cytoplasmic basophilic material in the nerve cells and inhibits their growth. Single doses of 20 to 40 r cause permanent alterations of individual nerve cells, and interfere with their organization into neuronal assemblies, such as layers of the cerebral cortex.
Stem cells persist throughout life by self-renewing in numerous tissues including the central and peripheral nervous systems. This raises the issue of whether there is a conserved mechanism to effect self-renewing divisions. Deficiency in the polycomb family transcriptional repressor Bmi-1 leads to progressive postnatal growth retardation and neurological defects. Here we show that Bmi-1 is required for the self-renewal of stem cells in the peripheral and central nervous systems but not for their survival or differentiation. The reduced self-renewal of Bmi-1-deficient neural stem cells leads to their postnatal depletion. In the absence of Bmi-1, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene p16Ink4a is upregulated in neural stem cells, reducing the rate of proliferation. p16Ink4a deficiency partially reverses the self-renewal defect in Bmi-1-/- neural stem cells. This conserved requirement for Bmi-1 to promote self-renewal and to repress p16Ink4a expression suggests that a common mechanism regulates the self-renewal and postnatal persistence of diverse types of stem cell. Restricted neural progenitors from the gut and forebrain proliferate normally in the absence of Bmi-1. Thus, Bmi-1 dependence distinguishes stem cell self-renewal from restricted progenitor proliferation in these tissues.
Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people around the world. Currently, there are no treatments that prevent or slow the disease. Like other neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by protein misfolding in the brain. This process and the associated brain damage begin years before the substantial neurodegeneration that accompanies dementia. Studies using new neuroimaging techniques and fluid biomarkers suggest that Alzheimer's disease pathology can be detected preclinically. These advances should allow the design of new clinical trials and early mechanism-based therapeutic intervention.
Glutamate-mediated damage to oligodendrocytes contributes to mental or physical impairment in periventricular leukomalacia (pre- or perinatal white matter injury leading to cerebral palsy), spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and stroke. Unlike neurons, white matter oligodendrocytes reportedly lack NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. It is believed that glutamate damages oligodendrocytes, especially their precursor cells, by acting on calcium-permeable AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)/kainate receptors alone or by reversing cystine-glutamate exchange and depriving cells of antioxidant protection. Here we show that precursor, immature and mature oligodendrocytes in the white matter of the cerebellum and corpus callosum exhibit NMDA-evoked currents, mediated by receptors that are blocked only weakly by Mg2+ and that may contain NR1, NR2C and NR3 NMDA receptor subunits. NMDA receptors are present in the myelinating processes of oligodendrocytes, where the small intracellular space could lead to a large rise in intracellular ion concentration in response to NMDA receptor activation. Simulating ischaemia led to development of an inward current in oligodendrocytes, which was partly mediated by NMDA receptors. These results point to NMDA receptors of unusual subunit composition as a potential therapeutic target for preventing white matter damage in a variety of diseases.
The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was examined by measuring the density of dopamine receptors in the postmortem brains of 81 control subjects and 59 schizophrenics from four different countries. The densities of dopamine receptors in the tissues from the schizophrenic patients had a bimodal distribution in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. One mode occurred 25 percent above the control density, and a second mode occurred at a density 2.3 times that of the control density for all three regions. Although almost all the patients had been medicated with neuroleptics, the two modes had the same dissociation constant for the labeled ligand used, suggesting that the neuroleptic doses were similar for the two populations of schizophrenics. The results thus provide direct evidence for two distinct categories of schizophrenia.
Prolonged, nonlocalized brain slow potential changes, frequently associated with cortical spreading depression, occur spontaneously during 5 days following brain implant surgery in rats. These potentials are accompanied by reductions in multiple nerve cell activity and reductions in behavioral motility. The method used in this study provides a tool for evaluating recovery from neurosurgical trauma or other brain injuries, and for testing procedures that facilitate or impede this process.
Extracellular single-unit recording techniques were used to test the ability of proglumide to block cholecystokinin-induced excitation of rat midbrain dopaminergic neurons and dopamine-sensitive prefrontal cortex cells. Intravenous and iontophoretic proglumide administration consistently blocked cholecystokinin-induced excitations while having no effect on glutamic acid-induced increases in activity. This selective blockade of central cholecystokinin effects by proglumide suggests that this drug may be valuable for studying the possible role of cholecystokinin as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the central nervous system.
Biosynthesis of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (L-pyroglutamyl-L-histidyl-L-proline amide) in vitro was studied. Rat hypothalamic fragments were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer that contained either (14)C-labeled proline, histidine, or glutamic acid (the three probable precursor amino acids,) and for control purposes each of 16 other naturally occurring amino acids. A number of labeled peptides were synthesized. With the use of synthetic thyrotropin-releasing hormone, detected by the Pauly reagent or with (125)1-labeled thyrotropin-releasing hormone as a marker, thin-layer chromatograms, paper electrophoresis, and carboxymethyl cellulose ion exchange chromatography revealed that only proline, histidine, and glutamic acid were consistently incorporated into peptides associated with the thyrotropin-releasing hormone region. This synthesizing activity was found in stalk median eminence, ventral hypothalamus. and dorsal hypothalamus but not in neural lobe or cerebral cortex. Because the biosynthetic peptide has identical properties with L-pyroglutamyl-L-histidyl-L-proline amide, it is probable that rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone is similar or identical to both bovine and porcine thyrotropin-releasing hormone and that the native material is present in the pyroglutamyl form in tissues.
Tritiated corticosterone injected subcutaneously into adrenalectomized male rats 1 hour before killing produced intense labeling of the hippocampus in radioautograms prepared by a method that reduced or prevented diffusion of the radioactive material. The pyramidal neurons of the cornu ammonis and the granule neurons of the gyrus dentatus contained more radioactivity than did other regions of the brain; however, the intensity of labeling varied among adjacent neurons. The nuclei of many neurons were clearly labeled but radioactivity was relatively sparse in the cytoplasm, in the axons where they branch from cell bodies, and in adjacent neuropil.
Growing retinal axons home to their distant target, the tectum, even when they are displaced from their normal pathway. This argues for long-range guidance mechanisms in the embryonic brain. Growth cones may orientate to diffusible attractants released from the target, as proposed in other systems, or they may use a stable distribution of positional information in the neuroepithelium. To distinguish between these possibilities, small pieces of the presumptive optic tract, through which retinal axons will normally grow, were rotated by approximately 90 degrees either clockwise or counterclockwise. When the retinal axons later encountered the rotated neuroepithelium, they also turned clockwise or counterclockwise, in correspondence with the direction of rotation. This demonstrates that long-range navigation of retinal axons in the vertebrate brain is based partly on stable, local positional factors, rather than on remote diffusible factors.
Units in areas of the midbrain rich in neurons containing serotonin respond to parenteral injections of d-lysergic acid diethylamide by a reversible cessation of spontaneous activity. The dose required is at or below threshold for gross behavioral effects. An inhibition of neurons containing serotonin after administration of d-lysergic acid diethylamide could account for the decreased metabolism of serotonin produced by this drug.
Mammalian neurons can synthesize choline by methylating phosphatidylethanolamine and hydrolyzing the resulting phosphatidylcholine. This process is stimulated by catecholamines. The phosphatidylethanolamine is synthesized in part from phosphatidylserine; hence the amino acids methionine (acting after conversion to S-adenosylmethionine) and serine can be the ultimate precursors of choline. Brain choline concentrations are generally higher than plasma concentrations, but depend on plasma concentrations because of the kinetic characteristics of the blood-brain-barrier transport system. When cholinergic neurons are activated, acetylcholine release can be enhanced by treatments that increase plasma choline (for example, consumption of certain foods).
Dopamine receptor belong to a large class of neurotransmitter and hormone receptors that are linked to their signal transduction pathways through guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). Pharmacological, biochemical and physiological criteria have been used to define two subcategories of dopamine receptors referred to as D1 and D2. D1 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and are coupled with the Gs regulatory protein. By contrast, activation of D2 receptors results in various responses including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol turnover, increase in K+ channel activity and inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization. The G protein(s) linking the D2 receptors to these responses have not been identified, although D2 receptors have been shown to both copurify and functionally reconstitute with both Gi and Go related proteins. The diversity of responses elicited by D2-receptor activation could reflect the existence of multiple D2 receptor subtypes, the identification of which is facilitated by the recent cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a rat D2 receptor. This receptor exhibits considerable amino-acid homology with other members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Here we report the identification and cloning of a cDNA encoding an RNA splice variant of the rat D2 receptor cDNA. This cDNA codes for a receptor isoform which is predominantly expressed in the brain and contains an additional 29 amino acids in the third cytoplasmic loop, a region believed to be involved in G protein coupling.
Five characters separate man from other hominoids-a large neocortex, bipedality, reduced anterior dentition with molar dominance, material culture, and unique sexual and reproductive behavior. Evidence provided by the fossil record, primate behavior, and demographic analysis shows that the traditional view that early human evolution was a direct consequence of brain expansion and material culture is incorrect, and that the unique sexual and reproductive behavior of man may be the sine qua non of human origin.
Until now, the only well documented, fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain has been glutamate. Although there is evidence for adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) acting as a transmitter in the peripheral nervous system, suggestions for such a role in the central nervous system have so far not been supported by any direct evidence. Here we report the recording of evoked and miniature synaptic currents in the rat medial habenula. The fast rise time of the currents showed that they were mediated by a ligand-activated ion channel rather than a second messenger system, thus limiting the known transmitter candidates. Evidence was found for the presence on the cells of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, acetylcholine and ATP receptors, but not for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT3) or glycine receptors. The evoked currents were unaffected by blockers of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid or acetylcholine receptors but were blocked by the ATP receptor-blocker, suramin and the desensitizing ATP receptor-agonist alpha,beta-methylene-ATP. Our evidence identifies for the first time synaptic currents in the brain, mediated directly by ATP receptors.
Astrocytes in the brain form an intimately associated network with neurons. They respond to neuronal activity and synaptically released glutamate by raising intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), which could represent the start of back-signalling to neurons. Here we show that coactivation of the AMPA/kainate and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on astrocytes stimulates these cells to release glutamate through a Ca2+-dependent process mediated by prostaglandins. Pharmacological inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis prevents glutamate release, whereas application of prostaglandins (in particular PGE2) mimics and occludes the releasing action of GluR agonists. PGE2 promotes Ca2+-dependent glutamate release from cultured astrocytes and also from acute brain slices under conditions that suppress neuronal exocytotic release. When applied to the CA1 hippocampal region, PGE2 induces increases in [Ca2+]i both in astrocytes and in neurons. The [Ca2+]i increase in neurons is mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes, because it is abolished by GluR antagonists. Our results reveal a new pathway of regulated transmitter release from astrocytes and outline the existence of an integrated glutamatergic cross-talk between neurons and astrocytes in situ that may play critical roles in synaptic plasticity and in neurotoxicity.
Most of our long-term memories of episodes or objects are organized so that we can retrieve them by association. Clinical neuropsychologists assess human memory by the paired-associate learning test, in which a series of paired words or figures is presented and the subject is then asked to retrieve the other pair member associated with each cue. Patients with lesions of the temporal lobe show marked impairment in this test. In our study, we trained monkeys in a pair-association task using a set of computer-generated paired patterns. We found two types of task-related neurons in the anterior temporal cortex. One type selectively responded to both pictures of the paired associates. The other type, which had the strongest response to one picture during the cue presentation, exhibited increasing activity during the delay period when the associate of that picture was used as a cue. These results provide new evidence that single neurons acquire selectivity for visual patterns through associative learning. They also indicate neural mechanisms for storage and retrieval in the long-term memory of paired associates.
In the brain and heart, rapidly inactivating (A-type) voltage-gated potassium (Kv) currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. Although pore-forming alpha-subunits of the Kv4, or Shal-related, channel family form A-type currents in heterologous cells, these differ significantly from native A-type currents. Here we describe three Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs) that bind to the cytoplasmic amino termini of Kv4 alpha-subunits. We find that expression of KChIP and Kv4 together reconstitutes several features of native A-type currents by modulating the density, inactivation kinetics and rate of recovery from inactivation of Kv4 channels in heterologous cells. All three KChIPs co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate with brain Kv4 alpha-subunits, and are thus integral components of native Kv4 channel complexes. The KChIPs have four EF-hand-like domains and bind calcium ions. As the activity and density of neuronal A-type currents tightly control responses to excitatory synaptic inputs, these KChIPs may regulate A-type currents, and hence neuronal excitability, in response to changes in intracellular calcium.
Each neuron in the mammalian brain carries many postsynaptic membrane specializations containing high densities of receptors that mediate signal transduction upon neurotransmitter release from the apposed nerve terminal. Little is known about the mechanisms by which receptors are transported to and anchored at postsynaptic sites, but extracellular as well as intracellular components may be involved. Ultrastructural studies have shown that the peripheral membrane protein gephyrin, which co-purifies with the postsynaptic inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) upon affinity chromatography, is situated on the cytoplasmic face of glycinergic postsynaptic membranes. Moreover, gephyrin binds with high affinity to polymerized tubulin and has been postulated to link the GlyR to the subsynaptic cytoskeleton. Here we report that treatment of rat spinal neurons in culture with gephyrin antisense oligonucleotides prevents the formation of GlyR clusters in the dendritic plasma membrane. Thus, gephyrin is essential for localizing the GlyR to presumptive postsynaptic plasma membrane specializations.
Benzodiazepines inhibit Ca2+-calmodulin-stimulated membrane protein phosphorylation. The effects of the benzodiazepines on protein phosphorylation are stereospecific and produced by membrane-bound benzodiazepine. The potency of benzodiazepine kinase inhibition is correlated with the ability of the benzodiazepines to inhibit electric shock-induced convulsions. These findings provide evidence that some of the anticonvulsant and neuronal stabilizing effects of benzodiazepines may be modulated by the Ca2+-calmodulin protein kinase system and indicate that this calmodulin-kinase system represents an identifiable benzodiazepine receptor in brain that is distinquishable by several criteria from the previously described high affinity benzodiazepine receptor.
Protein kinase C (PKC) is believed to have a crucial role in synaptic transmitter release and long-term potentiation. An important substrate of PKC in the brain is the neuron-specific presynaptically localized protein B-50 (also termed GAP-43, F1, pp46 or P-57). B-50 has been implicated in the regulation of polyphosphoinositide metabolism and calmodulin binding, and in the mechanisms of neurite outgrowth, long-term potentiation and transmitter release. It is still unknown, however, whether B-50 (and/or its phosphorylation) is essential to any of these processes. Here we report the results of studies in which antibodies to B-50, which interfere with B-50 phosphorylation, were introduced into rat cortical synaptosomes that were permeabilized with streptolysin-O (SL-O). We found that the release of [3H]noradrenaline, induced by increasing the Ca2+ concentration in the buffer, is inhibited completely by the antibodies. These results provide the first demonstration of a causal relationship between the PKC substrate B-50 and the release of neurotransmitter.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by impairments in social behaviors that are sometimes coupled to specialized cognitive abilities. A small percentage of ASD patients carry mutations in genes encoding neuroligins, which are postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules. We introduced one of these mutations into mice: the Arg451-->Cys451 (R451C) substitution in neuroligin-3. R451C mutant mice showed impaired social interactions but enhanced spatial learning abilities. Unexpectedly, these behavioral changes were accompanied by an increase in inhibitory synaptic transmission with no apparent effect on excitatory synapses. Deletion of neuroligin-3, in contrast, did not cause such changes, indicating that the R451C substitution represents a gain-of-function mutation. These data suggest that increased inhibitory synaptic transmission may contribute to human ASDs and that the R451C knockin mice may be a useful model for studying autism-related behaviors.
Sensory processing centres in both the vertebrate and the invertebrate brain are often organized into reiterated columns, thus facilitating an internal topographic representation of the external world. Cells within each column are arranged in a stereotyped fashion and form precise patterns of synaptic connections within discrete layers. These connections are largely confined to a single column, thereby preserving the spatial information from the periphery. Other neurons integrate this information by connecting to multiple columns. Restricting axons to columns is conceptually similar to tiling. Axons and dendrites of neighbouring neurons of the same class use tiling to form complete, yet non-overlapping, receptive fields. It is thought that, at the molecular level, cell-surface proteins mediate tiling through contact-dependent repulsive interactions, but proteins serving this function have not yet been identified. Here we show that the immunoglobulin superfamily member Dscam2 restricts the connections formed by L1 lamina neurons to columns in the Drosophila visual system. Our data support a model in which Dscam2 homophilic interactions mediate repulsion between neurites of L1 cells in neighbouring columns. We propose that Dscam2 is a tiling receptor for L1 neurons.
The use of different receptor blocking agents and single-unit recording techniques indicates that feedback inhibition of brain noradrenaline neurons by tricyclic antidepressants is mediated by presynaptic alpha-receptors. After chronic imipramine treatment, noradrenaline neurons in the locus coeruleus of rat brain remained partly depressed, in agreement with clinical data. They were, however, resistant to further inhibition by imipramine or clonidine.
Antisera to atriopeptin III and to a cyanogen bromide fragment of the precursor molecule atriopeptigen were prepared and used to examine the distribution of atriopeptin-like immunoreactive material in the heart and brain of the rat. Granules of this material were seen in myocytes throughout the right and left atria and were densest in the perinuclear region. The distribution of atriopeptin-like immunoreactive material in the heart is consistent with previous reports of atrial secretory granules. In the brain neurons containing the material were observed in the hypothalamus and the pontine tegmentum. Atriopeptin in the brain may serve as a neurotransmitter in neural systems controlling blood volume and composition, the same physiological functions regulated by blood-borne atriopeptin.
Self-movement of an organism through the environment is guided jointly by information provided by the vestibular system and by visual pathways that are specialized for detecting 'optic flow'. Motion of any object through space, including the self-motion of organisms, can be described with reference to six degrees of freedom: rotation about three orthogonal axes, and translation along these axes. Here we describe neurons in the pigeon brain that respond best to optic flow resulting from translation along one of the three orthogonal axes. We show that these translational optic flow neurons, like rotational optic flow neurons, share a common spatial frame of reference with the semicircular canals of the vestibular system. The three axes to which these neurons respond best are the vertical axis and two horizontal axes orientated at 45 degrees to either side of the body midline.
Economic choice is the behaviour observed when individuals select one among many available options. There is no intrinsically 'correct' answer: economic choice depends on subjective preferences. This behaviour is traditionally the object of economic analysis and is also of primary interest in psychology. However, the underlying mental processes and neuronal mechanisms are not well understood. Theories of human and animal choice have a cornerstone in the concept of 'value'. Consider, for example, a monkey offered one raisin versus one piece of apple: behavioural evidence suggests that the animal chooses by assigning values to the two options. But where and how values are represented in the brain is unclear. Here we show that, during economic choice, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode the value of offered and chosen goods. Notably, OFC neurons encode value independently of visuospatial factors and motor responses. If a monkey chooses between A and B, neurons in the OFC encode the value of the two goods independently of whether A is presented on the right and B on the left, or vice versa. This trait distinguishes the OFC from other brain areas in which value modulates activity related to sensory or motor processes. Our results have broad implications for possible psychological models, suggesting that economic choice is essentially choice between goods rather than choice between actions. In this framework, neurons in the OFC seem to be a good candidate network for value assignment underlying economic choice.
Many important physiological processes, including neurotransmitter release and muscle contraction, are regulated by the concentration of Ca2+ ions in the cell. Levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+ can be elevated by the entry of Ca2+ ions through voltage-dependent channels which are selective for Ca2+, Ba2+ and Sr2+ ions. We have measured currents through single, voltage-dependent calcium channels from rat brain that have been incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Channel gating was voltage-dependent: membrane depolarization increased the channel open times and decreased the closed times. The channels were selective for divalent cations over monovalent ions. The well-known calcium channel blockers, lanthanum and cadmium, produced a concentration-dependent reduction of the apparent single-channel conductance. Contrary to expectations, the nature of the divalent cation carrying current through the channel affected not only the single-channel conductance, but also the channel open times, with mean open times being shortest for barium.
One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the neurofibrillary tangle, which contains paired helical filaments (PHFs) composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau is hyperphosphorylated in PHFs, and phosphorylation of tau abolishes its ability to bind microtubules and promote microtubule assembly. Restoring the function of phosphorylated tau might prevent or reverse PHF formation in Alzheimer's disease. Phosphorylation on a serine or threonine that precedes proline (pS/T-P) alters the rate of prolyl isomerization and creates a binding site for the WW domain of the prolyl isomerase Pin1. Pin1 specifically isomerizes pS/T-P bonds and regulates the function of mitotic phosphoproteins. Here we show that Pin1 binds to only one pT-P motif in tau and copurifies with PHFs, resulting in depletion of soluble Pin1 in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Pin1 can restore the ability of phosphorylated tau to bind microtubules and promote microtubule assembly in vitro. As depletion of Pin1 induces mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death, sequestration of Pin1 into PHFs may contribute to neuronal death. These findings provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), a brain secretory polypeptide of insects, stimulates the prothoracic glands to produce and release ecdysone, the steroid essential to insect development. The complementary DNAs encoding PTTH of the silkmoth Bombyx mori were cloned and characterized, and the complete amino acid sequence was deduced. The data indicated that PTTH is first synthesized as a 224-amino acid polypeptide precursor containing three proteolytic cleavage signals. The carboxyl-terminal component (109 amino acids) that follows the last cleavage signal represents one PTTH subunit. Two PTTH subunits are linked together by disulfide bonds, before or after cleavage from prepro-PTTH, to form a homodimeric PTTH. When introduced into Escherichia coli cells, the complementary DNA directed the expression of an active substance that was functionally indistinguishable from natural PTTH. In situ hybridization showed the localization of the prepro-PTTH mRNA to two dorsolateral neurosecretory cells of the Bombyx brain.
The ability to maintain adequate nutrient intake is critical for survival. Complex interrelated neuronal circuits have developed in the mammalian brain to regulate many aspects of feeding behaviour, from food-seeking to meal termination. The hypothalamus and brainstem are thought to be the principal homeostatic brain areas responsible for regulating body weight. However, in the current 'obesogenic' human environment food intake is largely determined by non-homeostatic factors including cognition, emotion and reward, which are primarily processed in corticolimbic and higher cortical brain regions. Although the pleasure of eating is modulated by satiety and food deprivation increases the reward value of food, there is currently no adequate neurobiological account of this interaction between homeostatic and higher centres in the regulation of food intake in humans. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that peptide YY3-36 (PYY), a physiological gut-derived satiety signal, modulates neural activity within both corticolimbic and higher-cortical areas as well as homeostatic brain regions. Under conditions of high plasma PYY concentrations, mimicking the fed state, changes in neural activity within the caudolateral orbital frontal cortex predict feeding behaviour independently of meal-related sensory experiences. In contrast, in conditions of low levels of PYY, hypothalamic activation predicts food intake. Thus, the presence of a postprandial satiety factor switches food intake regulation from a homeostatic to a hedonic, corticolimbic area. Our studies give insights into the neural networks in humans that respond to a specific satiety signal to regulate food intake. An increased understanding of how such homeostatic and higher brain functions are integrated may pave the way for the development of new treatment strategies for obesity.
A loss in the number of functional, sodium ion-dependent, high-affinity choline transport sites was observed in the cortex and hippocampus of mice given an intracerebroventricular injection of 65 nanomoles of AF64A (ethylcholine mustard aziridinium ion) 3 days earlier. Such an effect was not observed in the striatum. This effect of AF64A represents a long-term neurochemical deficit at cholinergic nerve terminals in some brain regions which can lead to a persistent deficiency in central cholinergic transmission. The AF64A-treated animal may thus be a model for certain psychiatric or neurological disorders that appear to involve central cholinergic hypofunction.
To characterize the precursor of mammalian thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a rat hypothalamic lambda gt11 library was screened with an antiserum directed against a synthetic peptide representing a portion of the rat TRH prohormone. The nucleotide sequence of the immunopositive complementary DNA encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 29,247. This protein contained five copies of the sequence Gln-His-Pro-Gly flanked by paired basic amino acids and could therefore generate five TRH molecules. In addition, potential cleavage sites in the TRH precursor could produce other non-TRH peptides, which may be secreted. In situ hybridization to rat brain sections demonstrated that the pre-proTRH complementary DNA detected neurons concentrated in the parvocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus, the same location as cells detected by immunohistochemistry. These findings indicate that mammalian TRH arises by posttranslational processing of a larger precursor protein. The ability of the TRH prohormone to generate multiple copies of the bioactive peptide may be an important mechanism in the amplification of hormone production.
Neuronal death induced by activating N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been linked to Ca2+ and Na+ influx through associated channels. Whole-cell recording from cultured mouse cortical neurons revealed a NMDA-evoked outward current, INMDA-K, carried by K+ efflux at membrane potentials positive to -86 millivolts. Cortical neurons exposed to NMDA in medium containing reduced Na+ and Ca2+ (as found in ischemic brain tissue) lost substantial intracellular K+ and underwent apoptosis. Both K+ loss and apoptosis were attenuated by increasing extracellular K+, even when voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were blocked. Thus NMDA receptor-mediated K+ efflux may contribute to neuronal apoptosis after brain ischemia.
beta-Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the defining neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, but their pathophysiological relation is unclear. Injection of beta-amyloid Abeta42 fibrils into the brains of P301L mutant tau transgenic mice caused fivefold increases in the numbers of NFTs in cell bodies within the amygdala from where neurons project to the injection sites. Gallyas silver impregnation identified NFTs that contained tau phosphorylated at serine 212/threonine 214 and serine 422. NFTs were composed of twisted filaments and occurred in 6-month-old mice as early as 18 days after Abeta42 injections. Our data support the hypothesis that Abeta42 fibrils can accelerate NFT formation in vivo.
The circuitry and function of mammalian visual cortex are shaped by patterns of visual stimuli, a plasticity likely mediated by synaptic modifications. In the adult cat, asynchronous visual stimuli in two adjacent retinal regions controlled the relative spike timing of two groups of cortical neurons with high precision. This asynchronous pairing induced rapid modifications of intracortical connections and shifts in receptive fields. These changes depended on the temporal order and interval between visual stimuli in a manner consistent with spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. Parallel to the cortical modifications found in the cat, such asynchronous visual stimuli also induced shifts in human spatial perception.
Little has been done in the study of these intriguing questions, and I do not wish to give the impression that any extensive set of ideas exists that could be called a "theory." What is quite surprising, as far as the histories of science and philosophy are concerned, is that the major impetus for the fantastic growth of interest in brain processes, both psychological and physiological, has come from a device, a machine, the digital computer. In dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the rigorous requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity, uncertainty, and irrationality then we could use computers a million times more effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field of neurophysiology. The more we study the information processing aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become. It will be a very long time before we understand these processes sufficiently to reproduce them. In any case, the mathematician sees hundreds and thousands of formidable new problems in dozens of blossoming areas, puzzles galore, and challenges to his heart's content. He may never resolve some of these, but he will never be bored. What more can he ask?
Cognitive functions dependent on the prefrontal cortex, such as the ability to suppress behavior (response inhibition) and to learn from complex feedback (probabilistic learning), play critical roles in activities of daily life. To what extent do different neurochemical systems modulate these two cognitive functions? Here, using stop-signal and probabilistic learning tasks, we show a double dissociation for the involvement of noradrenaline and serotonin in human cognition. In healthy volunteers, inhibition of central noradrenaline reuptake improved response inhibition but had no effect on probabilistic learning, whereas inhibition of central serotonin reuptake impaired probabilistic learning with no effect on response inhibition.
Cranial radiation therapy causes a progressive decline in cognitive function that is linked to impaired neurogenesis. Chronic inflammation accompanies radiation injury, suggesting that inflammatory processes may contribute to neural stem cell dysfunction. Here, we show that neuroinflammation alone inhibits neurogenesis and that inflammatory blockade with indomethacin, a common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, restores neurogenesis after endotoxin-induced inflammation and augments neurogenesis after cranial irradiation.
Intracranial injection of angiotensin II (AII) or activation of the cerebral isorenin-angiotensin system with intracranial renin causes an immediate thirst and a delayed sodium appetite in the rat. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a polypeptide trophic factor for peripheral sympathetic and sensory neurones, has also been reported to be a potent stimulus to thirst and sodium appetite when injected into the brain of the rat. Lewis et al. drew attention to the marked similarity between the effects of 2.5S NGF and renin on thirst and sodium appetite and suggested that the NGF responses were mediated by the cerebral isorenin-angiotensin system. We report here that NGF-induced thirst and sodium appetite, as well as increased blood pressure and increase ornithine decarboxylase activity in the brain and liver, depend on the formation of AII (see also ref. 6).
A wide variety of voltage-gated K+ channels are involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. Their heterogeneity arises in part from the large number of genes encoding different K+ channel subunits (reviewed in ref. 1). In addition, heterologous expression studies indicate that assembly of distinct subunits into heteromultimeric channels may contribute further to K+ channel diversity. A question has been whether heteromeric K+ channels actually form in vivo, and if so, whether specific combinations of subunits could account for major K+ currents identified in neurons. We present here biochemical evidence that Kv1.4 and Kv1.2, two K+ channel subunits of the Shaker subfamily, co-assemble in rat brain. The Kv1.4/Kv1.2 heteromultimer combines features of both parent subunits, resulting in an A-type K+ channel. Immunocytochemical evidence suggests that the heteromultimers are localized in axons and nerve terminals. We propose that Kv1.4/Kv1.2 heteromultimers may form the molecular basis of a presynaptic A-type K+ channel involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.
The name of the senior author of "Catecholamine uptake in cerebral cortex: an adaptive change induced by fighting" (8 June 1973, page 1050) was misspelled. It should be Edith D. Hendley and not Edith D. Henley.
Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in Japan (incidence is 0.7-1.2 per 10,000 births), is characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy associated with brain malformation (micropolygria) due to a defect in the migration of neurons. We previously mapped the FCMD gene to a region of less than 100 kilobases which included the marker locus D9S2107 on chromosome 9q31. We have also described a haplotype that is shared by more than 80% of FCMD chromosomes, indicating that most chromosomes bearing the FCMD mutation could be derived from a single ancestor. Here we report that there is a retrotransposal insertion of tandemly repeated sequences within this candidate-gene interval in all FCMD chromosomes carrying the founder haplotype (87%). The inserted sequence is about 3 kilobases long and is located in the 3' untranslated region of a gene encoding a new 461-amino-acid protein. This gene is expressed in various tissues in normal individuals, but not in FCMD patients who carry the insertion. Two independent point mutations confirm that mutation of this gene is responsible for FCMD. The predicted protein, which we term fukutin, contains an amino-terminal signal sequence, which together with results from transfection experiments suggests that fukutin is a secreted protein. To our knowledge, FCMD is the first human disease to be caused by an ancient retrotransposal integration.
Complex cells in striate cortex of macaque showed a rapid pattern-specific adaptation. Adaptation made cells more sensitive to orientation change near the adapting orientation. It reduced correlations among the responses of populations of cells, thereby increasing the information transmitted by each action potential. These changes were brought about by brief exposures to stationary patterns, on the time scale of a single fixation. Thus, if successive fixations expose neurons' receptive fields to images with similar but not identical structure, adaptation will remove correlations and improve discriminability.
Second messenger systems may modulate neuronal activity through protein phosphorylation. However, interactions between two major second messenger pathways, the cyclic AMP and phosphatidylinositol systems, are not well understood. The effects of activators of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C on resting membrane properties, action potentials, and currents recorded from mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons and cerebral hemisphere neurons grown in primary dissociated cell culture were investigated. Neither forskolin (FOR) nor phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) altered resting membrane properties but both increased the duration of calcium-dependent action potentials in both central and peripheral neurons. By means of the single-electrode voltage clamp technique, FOR and PDBu were shown to decrease the same voltage-dependent potassium conductance. This suggests that two independent second messenger systems may affect the same potassium conductance.
Neurogenesis persists in the olfactory bulb (OB) of the adult mammalian brain. New interneurons are continually added to the OB from the subventricular zone (SVZ) via the rostral migratory stream (RMS). Here we show that secreted prokineticin 2 (PK2) functions as a chemoattractant for SVZ-derived neuronal progenitors. Within the OB, PK2 may also act as a detachment signal for chain-migrating progenitors arriving from the RMS. PK2 deficiency in mice leads to a marked reduction in OB size, loss of normal OB architecture, and the accumulation of neuronal progenitors in the RMS. These findings define an essential role for G protein-coupled PK2 signaling in postnatal and adult OB neurogenesis.
Non-mammalian vertebrates have an intrinsically photosensitive iris and thus a local pupillary light reflex (PLR). In contrast, it is thought that the PLR in mammals generally requires neuronal circuitry connecting the eye and the brain. Here we report that an intrinsic component of the PLR is in fact widespread in nocturnal and crepuscular mammals. In mouse, this intrinsic PLR requires the visual pigment melanopsin; it also requires PLCb4, a vertebrate homologue of the Drosophila NorpA phospholipase C which mediates rhabdomeric phototransduction. The Plcb4(-/-) genotype, in addition to removing the intrinsic PLR, also essentially eliminates the intrinsic light response of the M1 subtype of melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (M1-ipRGCs), which are by far the most photosensitive ipRGC subtype and also have the largest response to light. Ablating in mouse the expression of both TRPC6 and TRPC7, members of the TRP channel superfamily, also essentially eliminated the M1-ipRGC light response but the intrinsic PLR was not affected. Thus, melanopsin signalling exists in both iris and retina, involving a PLCb4-mediated pathway that nonetheless diverges in the two locations.
An important task in vision is to detect objects moving within a stationary scene. During normal viewing this is complicated by the presence of eye movements that continually scan the image across the retina, even during fixation. To detect moving objects, the brain must distinguish local motion within the scene from the global retinal image drift due to fixational eye movements. We have found that this process begins in the retina: a subset of retinal ganglion cells responds to motion in the receptive field centre, but only if the wider surround moves with a different trajectory. This selectivity for differential motion is independent of direction, and can be explained by a model of retinal circuitry that invokes pooling over nonlinear interneurons. The suppression by global image motion is probably mediated by polyaxonal, wide-field amacrine cells with transient responses. We show how a population of ganglion cells selective for differential motion can rapidly flag moving objects, and even segregate multiple moving objects.
Senile dementia of the Alzheimer type is a chronic, progressive neuropsychiatric condition characterized clinically by global intellectual impairment and neuropathologically by the presence of numerous argyrophilic plaques and tangles. Neurochemical investigations have established loss of the cholinergic and aminergic projections to the cerebral cortex and a loss of the content of somatostatin, with preservation of cholecystokinin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neuropeptides also located in cells intrinsic to the cortex. We describe here the relationship between cortical somatostatin immunoreactivity and the plaques and tangles of diseased tissue by immunocytochemical and silver impregnation techniques on paraffin-embedded tissue. In sections of Alzheimer's tissue, cortical somatostatin-immunoreactive perikarya exhibited morphological changes consistent with neuronal degeneration. Silver-stained material immunostained subsequently showed that many neurones containing tangles were also somatostatin positive. No such colocalization was observed using antisera to other neuropeptides. Our findings indicate that a subclass of somatostatin-positive neurones are affected selectively in Alzheimer's disease and that these neurones also contain neuronal tangles. Thus, destruction of somatostatin-containing neurones is an early and perhaps critical event in the disease process.
Intracellular recordings were made from locus coeruleus neurons in a brain slice preparation. Opiates and opioid peptides produced a dose-dependent, stereospecific, naloxone-reversible hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane. This was associated with an increase in membrane conductance.
Throughout the animal kingdom, the sight of a rapidly approaching object usually signals danger and elicits an escape response. Gibson suggested that the symmetrical expansion of an object's image (looming) is the critical variable determining that the object is on a collision course with the observer. Similarly, large expanding flow-fields like those produced by locomotion may precipitate manoeuvres such as turning or landing. From such observations it has been shown that the optic flow parameter, tau, which specifies time to contact with the approaching object best fits the behavioural data. We describe a subpopulation of neurons in the nucleus rotundus of the pigeon brain that respond selectively to objects moving on a collision course towards the bird.
Injection of 2.5,5, 10, or 20 milligrams of p-chloroamphetamine per kilogram of body weight into rats produced evidence of cytopathological changes in sections of brain stained by a Nissl or silver method. As early as 1 day after drug injection cells demonstrated an intense Nissl staining, intense argyrophilia, cellular shrinkage, and perineuronal spaces. At 30 days after injection both stains revealed cellular debris and glial reactions characteristic of cellular dissolution. The neurotoxic effects of 2.5, 5, or 10 milligrams of p-chloroamphetamine per kilogram were primarily restricted to an area of the ventral midbrain tegmentum corresponding to the distribution of the B-9 serotonergic cell group. After 20 milligrams of p-chloroamphetamine per kilogram there was also evidence of neurotoxic effects on cells within the substantia nigra. These results confirm previous suggestions that the long-term reduction in serotonin content of brain, tryptophan-5-hydroxylase activity, and uptake of serotonin after injection of p-chloroamphetamine is due to a neurotoxic effect of the drug or some metabolite on serotonergic cell bodies.
Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine repeat in the protein huntingtin (Htt) with mutant Htt (mHtt) expressed throughout the body and similarly in all brain regions. Yet, HD neuropathology is largely restricted to the corpus striatum. We report that the small guanine nucleotide-binding protein Rhes, which is localized very selectively to the striatum, binds physiologically to mHtt. Using cultured cells, we found Rhes induces sumoylation of mHtt, which leads to cytotoxicity. Thus, Rhes-mHtt interactions can account for the localized neuropathology of HD.
Sensory neuroscience seeks to understand how the brain encodes natural environments. However, neural coding has largely been studied using simplified stimuli. In order to assess whether the brain's coding strategy depends on the stimulus ensemble, we apply a new information-theoretic method that allows unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation.
Intravenous bicuculline was used to examine how removing gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition affects the visual response properties of single cortical neurons. Simple neurons were depressed and complex neurons showed increase in the vigor and range of responses. Hypercomplex cells were no longer inhibited by elongated stimuli. The results are consistent with present evidence concerning the origin and distribution of inhibitory connections within the cortex.
Measles virus generally produces acute illness. Rarely, however, persistent infection of brain cells occurs, resulting in a chronic and fatal neurological disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Evidence indicates that expression of the measles virus matrix protein is selectively restricted in this persistent infection, but the mechanism underlying this restriction has not been identified. Defective translation of matrix messenger RNA has been described in one SSPE cell line. This report presents evidence that in a different SSPE tissue culture cell line IP-3-Ca, the matrix protein is synthesized but fails to accumulate. A general scheme is proposed to reconcile the different levels at which restriction of matrix protein has been observed.
Single neurons in the midbrain tegmentum of rats showed clear discriminatory responses to three tones announcing either food or water or no reinforcement. Subjects were required to press a single lever and remain motionless for 2 seconds during which time unit activity from several brain sites was recorded. One of the tones, randomly designated, was sounded halfway through this period. Manipulation of drive states revealed that the highest activity was associated with tones announcing the reinforcement for which the animal was most strongly motivated. Thus, from a hungry animal sustained or increased firing rates were elicited by a " food" tone and differentially lowered rates by the other tones.
Originally described by Lugaresi et al. in 1986 (ref. 1), fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rare inherited neurological disease characterized by the subacute progression of intractable insomnia and other autonomic abnormalities, cerebellar and pyramidal signs, myoclonus and dementia; neuropathologically, the major feature is severe neuronal loss with associated gliosis in the ventral and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. The disease has been related to the group of spongiform encephalopathies by virtue of the presence of low levels of proteinase-resistant amyloid protein (PrPres) in the brain, and of a pathogenic single-allele mutation at codon 178 of the PRNP gene that encodes PrPres (refs 2, 5). Here we report the successful transmission of the disease to experimental animals, placing FFI within the group of infectious cerebral amyloidoses.
Involvement of the Hox genes in regional specifications of the vertebrate body axis is suggested by sequence similarity with the homeotic selector genes of Drosophila, the conservation of a collinear relationship between genomic organization and site of expression, and mutational analysis. Subdivision of vertebrate embryo hindbrain neuroepithelium into lineage compartments (rhombomeres) underlies segmental patterning of neuronal differentiation. The rhombomere boundaries delimit domains of expression of Hox genes, presumed to be determinants of rhombomere phenotype, suggesting that Hox genes confer positional value; the formation of rhombomere 4 (r4) is followed by strong expression of Hox-2.9 within its confines. If the Hox genes are determinants, their expression should be autonomous from the developmental stage at which regional commitment becomes fixed and irreversible. We have transplanted the future r4 region (from state-9-chick embryos) into the more anterior position of r2 and probed for Hox-2.9 transcripts. We report here that Hox-2.9 was expressed in the ectopic r4 as strongly as in the normal r4, whereas reciprocal grafts of future r2 to r4 position did not express Hox-2.9. The phenotype of ectopic rhombomeres developed according to their original position, as demonstrated by retrograde tracing of efferent cranial nerve nuclei. As early as stage-9-(six somites), both Hox-2.9 expression and segment identity are autonomous in the chick embryo hindbrain, independent both of position in the neuroepithelium and of signals from the underlying mesoderm.
Viruses frequently persist in neurons, suggesting that these cells can evade immune surveillance. In a mouse model, 5 x 10(6) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), did not lyse infected neurons or cause immunopathologic injury. In contrast, intracerebral injection of less than 10(3) CTL caused disease and death when viral antigens were expressed on leptomeningeal and choroid plexus cells of the nervous system. The neuronal cell line OBL21 expresses little or no major histocompatibility (MHC) class I surface glycoproteins and when infected with LCMV, resisted lysis by virus-specific CTLs. Expression of MHC heavy chain messenger RNA was limited, but beta 2-microglobulin messenger RNA and protein was made normally. OBL21 cells were made sensitive to CTL lysis by transfection with a fusion gene encoding another MHC class I molecule. Hence, neuronal cells probably evade immune surveillance by failing to express MHC class I molecules.
Schizophrenia is a complex disorder, caused by both genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. Research on pathogenesis has traditionally focused on neurotransmitter systems in the brain, particularly those involving dopamine. Schizophrenia has been considered a separate disease for over a century, but in the absence of clear biological markers, diagnosis has historically been based on signs and symptoms. A fundamental message emerging from genome-wide association studies of copy number variations (CNVs) associated with the disease is that its genetic basis does not necessarily conform to classical nosological disease boundaries. Certain CNVs confer not only high relative risk of schizophrenia but also of other psychiatric disorders. The structural variations associated with schizophrenia can involve several genes and the phenotypic syndromes, or the 'genomic disorders', have not yet been characterized. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies with the potential to implicate individual genes in complex diseases may reveal underlying biological pathways. Here we combined SNP data from several large genome-wide scans and followed up the most significant association signals. We found significant association with several markers spanning the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21.3-22.1, a marker located upstream of the neurogranin gene (NRGN) on 11q24.2 and a marker in intron four of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) on 18q21.2. Our findings implicating the MHC region are consistent with an immune component to schizophrenia risk, whereas the association with NRGN and TCF4 points to perturbation of pathways involved in brain development, memory and cognition.
Hypogonadism in the mutant hpg mouse is characterized by a deficiency of hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). Affected male mice exhibit immature reproductive organs, small abdominal testes and low pituitary and plasma gonadotropin concentrations. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of fetal brain transplants to establish functional connections with host tissues. We therefore sought to use this approach to correct the hpg deficit. Fetal preoptic area (POA) (a site of GnRH production) from unaffected animals of the hpg strain was transplanted into the anterior third ventricle of adult hpg mice. We report that in such implanted animals, killed 2 months post-implantation, the POA grafts contained GnRH neurones, from which GnRH-positive fibres could be traced to capillaries of the median eminence. Hypothalamic GnRH and pituitary and plasma gonadotropin concentrations were increased compared with levels in untreated (hpg) animals. The testes were enlarged and had descended into the scrotum. Evidence of full spermatogenesis and interstitial cell development was present in testicular sections. No such effects were seen with transplants of cortical tissue.
The molecular mechanisms underlying directed motility of growth cones have not been determined. The role of myosin-V, an unconventional myosin, in growth cone dynamics was examined by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI). CALI of purified chick brain myosin-V absorbed onto nitrocellulose-coated cover slips inhibited the ability of myosin-V to translocate actin filaments. CALI of myosin-V in growth cones of chick dorsal root ganglion neurons resulted in rapid filopodial retraction. The rate of filopodial extension was significantly decreased, whereas the rate of filopodial retraction was not affected, which suggests a specific role for myosin-V in filopodial extension.
Rat virus selectively destroys the external germinal layer of the cerebellar cortex when inoculated intracerebrally into newborn cats. The lesions are marked by numerous intranuclear inclusion bodies and a rise of virus titers. These effects suggest that the spontaneous ataxia of cats which is accompanied by cerebellar hypoplasia, may be of viral origin.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently causes neurological dysfunction and is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with HIV encephalitis or myelopathy. The virus is found mostly in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage within the CNS, but the possibility of infection of other glial cells has been raised. Therefore, the effects of different HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains were studied in primary cultures of adult human brain containing microglial cells, the resident CNS macrophages, and astrocytes. These cultures could be productively infected with macrophage-adapted HIV-1 isolates but not with T lymphocyte-adapted HIV-1 isolates or two HIV-2 isolates. As determined with a triple-label procedure, primary astrocytes did not express HIV gag antigens and remained normal throughout the 3-week course of infection. In contrast, virus replicated in neighboring microglial cells, often leading to their cell fusion and death. The death of microglial cells, which normally serve immune functions in the CNS, may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalitis or myelopathy.
Investigation of the actions of the benzodiazepines has provided insights into the neurochemical mechanisms underlying anxiety, seizures, muscle relaxation, and sedation. Behavioral, electrophysical, pharmacological, and biochemical evidence indicates that the benzodiazepines exert their therapeutic effects by interacting with a high-affinity binding site (receptor) in the brain. The benzodiazepine receptor interacts with a receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, and enhances its inhibitory effects. The benzodiazepine receptor may also interact with endogenous substances and several naturally occurring compounds, including the purines and nicotinamide, are candidates for this role. Both the purines and nicotinamide possess some benzodiazepine-like properties in vivo, although further work will be required to confirm their possible roles as endogenous benzodiazepines.
A fundamental function of the visual system is to encode the building blocks of natural scenes-edges, textures and shapes-that subserve visual tasks such as object recognition and scene understanding. Essential to this process is the formation of abstract representations that generalize from specific instances of visual input. A common view holds that neurons in the early visual system signal conjunctions of image features, but how these produce invariant representations is poorly understood. Here we propose that to generalize over similar images, higher-level visual neurons encode statistical variations that characterize local image regions. We present a model in which neural activity encodes the probability distribution most consistent with a given image. Trained on natural images, the model generalizes by learning a compact set of dictionary elements for image distributions typically encountered in natural scenes. Model neurons show a diverse range of properties observed in cortical cells. These results provide a new functional explanation for nonlinear effects in complex cells and offer insight into coding strategies in primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas.
Recovery from viral encephalomyelitis requires immune-mediated noncytolytic clearance from neurons by mechanisms assumed to be the same for all neurons. In alphavirus encephalomyelitis, antibody clears infectious virus from neurons in all regions of the central nervous system (CNS), but CD8 T cells contribute to elimination of viral RNA. To understand the role of T cells in clearance, we infected antibody knockout mice with Sindbis virus. Virus was cleared from spinal cord and brain stem neurons, but not from cortical neurons, and required both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Infection with cytokine-expressing recombinant viruses suggested that T cells used interferon-gamma, but not tumor necrosis factor alpha, in clearing virus and that populations of neurons differ in responsiveness to this effector pathway.
Dopamine receptors belong to a superfamily of receptors that exert their biological effects through guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins. Two main dopamine receptor subtypes have been identified, D1 and D2, which differ in their pharmacological and biochemical characteristics. D1 stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity, whereas D2 inhibits it. Both receptors are primary targets for drugs used to treat many psychomotor diseases, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Whereas the dopamine D1 receptor has been cloned, biochemical and behavioural data indicate that dopamine D1-like receptors exist which either are not linked to adenylyl cyclase or display different pharmacological activities. We report here the cloning of a gene encoding a 477-amino-acid protein with strong homology to the cloned D1 receptor. The receptor, called D5, binds drugs with a pharmacological profile similar to that of the cloned D1 receptor, but displays a 10-fold higher affinity for the endogenous agonist, dopamine. As with D1, the dopamine D5 receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses reveal that the receptor is neuron-specific, localized primarily within limbic regions of the brain; no messenger RNA was detected in kidney, liver, heart or parathyroid gland. The existence of a dopamine D1-like receptor with these characteristics had not been predicted and may represent an alternative pathway for dopamine-mediated events and regulation of D2 receptor activity.
The X- and Y-cell pathways in cats form two functionally distinct, parallel systems from the retina through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the visual cortex1-4. We recently used the technique of intraaxonal injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to demonstrate major differences between X- and Y-cells in their retinogeniculate termination patterns5 (compare Figs 1 alpha and 2 alpha). Normally, axons of X-cells innervate geniculate lamina A or A1 (depending on the eye of origin) in narrow zones oriented perpendicular to the lamination. Some X-cells also terminate sparsely (that is, with few boutons) in the medial interlaminar nucleus (MIN), a subdivision of the LGN. Y-cell axons terminate either in laminae C and A (from the contralateral retina) or in lamina A1 (from the ipsilateral retina) in broad zones5,6, and most also terminate densely (with many boutons) in the MIN. We now report that cats raised with monocular lid suture develop abnormal retinogeniculate termination patterns. Many X-cell axons arising from the deprived eye have unusually broad terminal fields in lamina A or A1, and some also densely innervate the MIN. Many Y-cell axons from the deprived eye have dramatically shrunken or absent terminal fields in the A laminae and MIN. These changes constitute the most peripheral effects of monocular deprivation discovered so far, are consistent with previous reports of functional abnormalities among deprived geniculate neurones4,7,8 ad suggest possible mechanisms by which the visual environment influences neuronal development.
Small neurons of the substantia gelatinosa Rolandi and the subjacent dorsal horn of the spinal cord have been thought to exert a direct modulatory effect only on neurons located within a distance of a few spinal segemnts. By using the technique of retorograde transport of horseradish peroxidase, however, it has been found that in the rat a significant number of these cells, particularly those of the subjacent dorsal horn, ascend many spinal segments to the lateral cervical nucleus and to the lower brainstem. These data provide an anatomic basis for a role of substantia gelatinosa Rolandi and subjacent dorsal horn cells in madulating or contributing to sensory information transmission not only in nearby segments but in far distant structures.
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder marked by hallucinations, delusions, cognitive deficits and apathy, with a heritability estimated at 73-90% (ref. 1). Inheritance patterns are complex, and the number and type of genetic variants involved are not understood. Copy number variants (CNVs) have been identified in individual patients with schizophrenia and also in neurodevelopmental disorders, but large-scale genome-wide surveys have not been performed. Here we report a genome-wide survey of rare CNVs in 3,391 patients with schizophrenia and 3,181 ancestrally matched controls, using high-density microarrays. For CNVs that were observed in less than 1% of the sample and were more than 100 kilobases in length, the total burden is increased 1.15-fold in patients with schizophrenia in comparison with controls. This effect was more pronounced for rarer, single-occurrence CNVs and for those that involved genes as opposed to those that did not. As expected, deletions were found within the region critical for velo-cardio-facial syndrome, which includes psychotic symptoms in 30% of patients. Associations with schizophrenia were also found for large deletions on chromosome 15q13.3 and 1q21.1. These associations have not previously been reported, and they remained significant after genome-wide correction. Our results provide strong support for a model of schizophrenia pathogenesis that includes the effects of multiple rare structural variants, both genome-wide and at specific loci.
In the central nervous system, ageing results in a precipitous decline in adult neural stem/progenitor cells and neurogenesis, with concomitant impairments in cognitive functions. Interestingly, such impairments can be ameliorated through systemic perturbations such as exercise. Here, using heterochronic parabiosis we show that blood-borne factors present in the systemic milieu can inhibit or promote adult neurogenesis in an age-dependent fashion in mice. Accordingly, exposing a young mouse to an old systemic environment or to plasma from old mice decreased synaptic plasticity, and impaired contextual fear conditioning and spatial learning and memory. We identify chemokines--including CCL11 (also known as eotaxin)--the plasma levels of which correlate with reduced neurogenesis in heterochronic parabionts and aged mice, and the levels of which are increased in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of healthy ageing humans. Lastly, increasing peripheral CCL11 chemokine levels in vivo in young mice decreased adult neurogenesis and impaired learning and memory. Together our data indicate that the decline in neurogenesis and cognitive impairments observed during ageing can be in part attributed to changes in blood-borne factors.
Much evidence indicates that abnormal processing and extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (A beta), a proteolytic derivative of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP), is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in ref. 1). In the PDAPP transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, immunization with A beta causes a marked reduction in burden of the brain amyloid. Evidence that A beta immunization also reduces cognitive dysfunction in murine models of Alzheimer's disease would support the hypothesis that abnormal A beta processing is essential to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and would encourage the development of other strategies directed at the 'amyloid cascade'. Here we show that A beta immunization reduces both deposition of cerebral fibrillar A beta and cognitive dysfunction in the TgCRND8 murine model of Alzheimer's disease without, however, altering total levels of A beta in the brain. This implies that either a approximately 50% reduction in dense-cored A beta plaques is sufficient to affect cognition, or that vaccination may modulate the activity/abundance of a small subpopulation of especially toxic A beta species.
To ascertain whether Huntington's chorea and schizophrenia are associated with specific regional alterations in neurotensin, somatostatin, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, the concentrations of these putative neurotransmitters were measured by radioimmunoassay in postmortem brain samples from patients with Huntington's chorea or schizophrenia. Compared to 50 patients without psychiatric or neurological disease, the patients with Huntington's chorea showed significantly elevated concentrations of all three neuropeptides in the nucleus caudatus. In the nucleus accumbens somatostatin levels were increased threefold, while in the amygdala thyrotropin-releasing hormone levels were elevated. In contrast, the schizophrenics exhibited reduced levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone in two frontal cortical regions, reduced somatostatin levels in one frontal cortical area, and increased neurotensin levels in one frontal cortical area. None of the differences between the diseased brains and the controls could be accounted for by differences in age, sex, or time between death and autopsy.
Removal of sensory input from a focal region of adult neocortex can lead to a large reorganization of cortical topography within the deprived area during subsequent months. Although this form of functional recovery is now well documented across several sensory systems, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive. Weeks after binocular retinal lesions silence a corresponding portion of striate cortex in the adult cat, this cortex again becomes responsive, this time to retinal loci immediately outside the scotoma. Earlier findings showed a lack of reorganization in the lateral geniculate nucleus and an inadequate spread of geniculocortical afferents to account for the cortical reorganization, suggesting the involvement of intrinsic cortical connections. We investigated the possibility that intracortical axonal sprouting mediates long-term reorganization of cortical functional architecture. The anterograde label biocytin was used to compare the density of lateral projections into reorganized and non-deprived cortex. We report here that structural changes in the form of axonal sprouting of long-range laterally projecting neurons accompany topographic remodelling of the visual cortex.
The diencephalon is a complex integration centre and intricate relay station of the vertebrate brain. Its development involves the generation of great cellular diversity and neuronal specificity. We report here that it becomes organized in steps, through a stereotyped sequence of neuromeric subdivisions. Diencephalic neuromeres define four cellular domains (D1-D4) that can be followed throughout development, each unit contributing to a well defined part of the adult structural pattern. We propose that the segmental identity of each diencephalic unit is specified by a unique combination of genes, maintained by polyclonal cell lineage restrictions. A comparison of vertebrate and arthropod development suggests that the basic principles that control anterior axial patterning and set up neuronal specificity in the embryonic central nervous system are highly conserved in evolution.
In mice, pheromone detection is mediated by the vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium. Male mice that are deficient for Trpc2, an ion channel specifically expressed in VNO neurons and essential for VNO sensory transduction, are impaired in sex discrimination and male-male aggression. We report here that Trpc2-/- female mice show a reduction in female-specific behaviour, including maternal aggression and lactating behaviour. Strikingly, mutant females display unique characteristics of male sexual and courtship behaviours such as mounting, pelvic thrust, solicitation, anogenital olfactory investigation, and emission of complex ultrasonic vocalizations towards male and female conspecific mice. The same behavioural phenotype is observed after VNO surgical removal in adult animals, and is not accompanied by disruption of the oestrous cycle and sex hormone levels. These findings suggest that VNO-mediated pheromone inputs act in wild-type females to repress male behaviour and activate female behaviours. Moreover, they imply that functional neuronal circuits underlying male-specific behaviours exist in the normal female mouse brain.
It is not known how the visual system is organized to extract information about shape from the continuous gradations of light and dark found on shaded surfaces of three-dimensional objects. To investigate this question, we used a learning algorithm to construct a neural network model which determines surface curvatures from images of simple geometrical surfaces. The receptive fields developed by units in the network were surprisingly similar to the actual receptive fields of neurons observed in the visual cortex which are commonly believed to be 'edge' or 'bar' detectors, but have never previously been associated with shading. Thus, our study illustrates the difficulty of trying to deduce neuronal function solely from determination of their receptive fields. It is also important to consider the connections a neuron makes with other neurons in subsequent stages of processing, which we call its 'projective field'.
Voltage-sensitive sodium channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of the action potential and therefore are important for neuronal excitability. Complementary DNA clones encoding the beta 1 subunit of the rat brain sodium channel were isolated by a combination of polymerase chain reaction and library screening techniques. The deduced primary structure indicates that the beta 1 subunit is a 22,851-dalton protein that contains a single putative transmembrane domain and four potential extracellular N-linked glycosylation sites, consistent with biochemical data. Northern blot analysis reveals a 1,400-nucleotide messenger RNA in rat brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and spinal cord. Coexpression of beta 1 subunits with alpha subunits increases the size of the peak sodium current, accelerates its inactivation, and shifts the voltage dependence of inactivation to more negative membrane potentials. These results indicate that the beta 1 subunit is crucial in the assembly, expression, and functional modulation of the heterotrimeric complex of the rat brain sodium channel.
The ability of synapses to modify their synaptic strength in response to activity is a fundamental property of the nervous system and may be an essential component of learning and memory. There are three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptor, namely NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-4-propionic acid) and kainate receptors; critical roles in synaptic plasticity have been identified for two of these. Thus, at many synapses in the brain, transient activation of NMDA receptors leads to a persistent modification in the strength of synaptic transmission mediated by AMPA receptors. Here, to determine whether kainate receptors are involved in synaptic plasticity, we have used a new antagonist, LY382884 ((3S, 4aR, 6S, 8aR)-6-((4-carboxyphenyl)methyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydro isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid), which antagonizes kainate receptors at concentrations that do not affect AMPA or NMDA receptors. We find that LY382884 is a selective antagonist at neuronal kainate receptors containing the GluR5 subunit. It has no effect on long-term potentiation (LTP) that is dependent on NMDA receptors but prevents the induction of mossy fibre LTP, which is independent of NMDA receptors. Thus, kainate receptors can act as the induction trigger for long-term changes in synaptic transmission.
The paradigmatic feature of long-term memory (LTM) is its persistence. However, little is known about the mechanisms that make some LTMs last longer than others. In rats, a long-lasting fear LTM vanished rapidly when the D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390 was injected into the dorsal hippocampus 12 hours, but not immediately or 9 hours, after the fearful experience. Conversely, intrahippocampal application of the D1 agonist SK38393 at the same critical post-training time converted a rapidly decaying fear LTM into a persistent one. This effect was mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor and regulated by the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Thus, the persistence of LTM depends on activation of VTA/hippocampus dopaminergic connections and can be specifically modulated by manipulating this system at definite post-learning time points.
The hippocampus, a critical brain structure for navigation, context-dependent learning and episodic memory, is composed of anatomically heterogeneous subregions. These regions differ in their anatomical inputs as well as in their internal circuitry. A major feature of the CA3 region is its recurrent collateral circuitry, by which the CA3 pyramidal cells make excitatory synaptic contacts on each other. In contrast, pyramidal cells in the CA1 region are not extensively interconnected. Although these differences have inspired numerous theoretical models of differential processing capacities of these two regions, there have been few reports of robust differences in the firing properties of CA1 and CA3 neurons in behaving animals. The most extensively studied of these properties is the spatially selective firing of hippocampal 'place cells'. Here we report that in a dynamically changing environment, in which familiar landmarks on the behavioural track and along the wall are rotated relative to each other, the population representation of the environment is more coherent between the original and cue-altered environments in CA3 than in CA1. These results demonstrate a functional heterogeneity between the place cells of CA3 and CA1 at the level of neural population representations.
Cardiocytes in the atria contain a prohormone that gives rise to atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP's), which have intrinsic hemodynamic regulatory activity. The distribution of ANP's in the brain suggests the involvement of these peptides in central cardiovascular regulation. In conscious rats with chronic indwelling catheters, volume loading with isotonic saline or glucose increased the amount of circulating immunoreactive ANP's by a factor of 4 to 5, as determined by radioimmunoassay. Hyperosmotic challenge with a hypertonic NaCl solution or anesthesia with halothane caused similar increases in plasma ANP's. Results obtained with the denervated-heart preparation indicate that neuronal influences are important in the release of ANP's induced by volume loading. As judged from reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of extracted plasma and radioimmunoassay of collected fractions, the circulating physiologically important ANP's in the conscious rodent appear to be alpha-rANP(5-28) (atriopeptin III) and either alpha-rANP(3-28) [ANF(8-33)] or alpha-rANP(1-28) (ANF).
A discrete, ascending fiber system that supplies the hypothalamus with most of its noradrenergic terminals was destroyed at midbrain level, both electrolytically and with local injections of 6-hydroxydopamine, a destructive agent specific for catecholaminergic neurons. The result was hyperphagia leading to obesity. Fluorescence histochemical analysis showed that loss of noradrenergic terminals in ventral bundle termination areas such as the hypothalamus was necessary for hyperphagia. Damage to dorsal bundle or dopaminergic projections was not. Prior treatment with desmethylimipramine to selectively block uptake of 6-hydroxydopamine into noradrenergic neurons prevented both hyperphagia and loss of norepinephrine fluorescence. The lesions that produced hyperphagia also reduced the potency of d-amphetamine as an appetite suppressant. It is concluded that this noradrenergic bundle normally mediates suppression of feeding, thereby influences body weight, and serves as a substrate for d-amphetamine-induced loss of appetite.
Recent evidence indicates that the nucleus basalis of Meynert, a distinct population of basal forebrain neurons, is a major source of cholinergic innervation of the cerebral cortex. Postmortem studies have previously demonstrated profound reduction in the presynaptic markers for cholinergic neurons in the cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The results of this study show that neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert undergo a profound (greater than 75 percent) and selective degeneration in these patients and provide a pathological substrate of the cholinergic deficiency in their brains. Demonstration of selective degeneration of such neurons represents the first documentation of a loss of a transmitter-specific neuronal population in a major disorder of higher cortical function and, as such, points to a critical subcortical lesion in Alzheimer's patients.
Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of CAG triplet repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene (also called HD) and characterized by accumulation of aggregated fragments of polyglutamine-expanded HTT protein in affected neurons. Abnormal enrichment of HD inclusion bodies with ubiquitin, a diagnostic characteristic of HD and many other neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, has suggested that dysfunction in ubiquitin metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. Because modification of proteins with polyubiquitin chains regulates many essential cellular processes including protein degradation, cell cycle, transcription, DNA repair and membrane trafficking, disrupted ubiquitin signalling is likely to have broad consequences for neuronal function and survival. Although ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is impaired in cell-culture models of HD and of other neurodegenerative diseases, it has not been possible to evaluate the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in HD patients or in animal models of the disease, and a functional role for UPS impairment in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis remains controversial. Here we exploit a mass-spectrometry-based method to quantify polyubiquitin chains and demonstrate that the abundance of these chains is a faithful endogenous biomarker of UPS function. Lys 48-linked polyubiquitin chains accumulate early in pathogenesis in brains from the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD, from a knock-in model of HD and from human HD patients, establishing that UPS dysfunction is a consistent feature of HD pathology. Lys 63- and Lys 11-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are not typically associated with proteasomal targeting, also accumulate in the R6/2 mouse brain. Thus, HD is linked to global changes in the ubiquitin system to a much greater extent than previously recognized.
Arachidonic acid is released by phospholipase A2 when activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by neurotransmitter glutamate raises the calcium concentration in neurons, for example during the initiation of long-term potentiation and during brain anoxia. Here we investigate the effect of arachidonic acid on glutamate-gated ion channels by whole-cell clamping isolated cerebellar granule cells. Arachidonic acid potentiates, and makes more transient, the current through NMDA receptor channels, and slightly reduces the current through non-NMDA receptor channels. Potentiation of the NMDA receptor current results from an increase in channel open probability, with no change in open channel current. We observe potentiation even with saturating levels of agonist at the glutamate- and glycine-binding sites on these channels; it does not result from conversion of arachidonic acid to lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase derivatives, or from activation of protein kinase C. Arachidonic acid may act by binding to a site on the NMDA receptor, or by modifying the receptor's lipid environment. Our results suggest that arachidonic acid released by activation of NMDA (or other) receptors will potentiate NMDA receptor currents, and thus amplify increases in intracellular calcium concentration caused by glutamate. This may explain why inhibition of phospholipase A2 blocks the induction of long-term potentiation.
Direct projections from the amygdala to the entire frontal cortex were demonstrated in the cat using the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Injections throughout the prefrontal cortex labeled neurons in the ipsilateral basal magnocellular amygdaloid nucleus; injections in the premotor and motor cortices labeled neurons in the same nucleus plus a few cells in the anterior amygdaloid area.
During vertebrate development, many neurons depend for survival and differentiation on their target cells. The best documented mediator of such a retrograde trophic action is the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF and the other known members of the neurotrophin family, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) are conserved as distinct genes over large evolutionary distances. Here we report the cloning of neurotrophin-6 (NT-6), a new member of this family from the teleost fish Xiphophorus. NT-6 distinguishes itself from the other known neurotrophins in that it is not found as a soluble protein in the medium of producing cells. The addition of heparin (but not chondroitin) effects the release of NT-6 from cell surface and extracellular matrix molecules. Recombinant purified NT-6 has a spectrum of actions similar to NGF on chick sympathetic and sensory neurons, albeit with a lower potency. NT-6 is expressed in the embryonic valvulla cerebelli; expression persists in some adult tissues. The interaction of NT-6 with heparin-binding molecules may modulate its action in the nervous system.
The effects of the psychotomimetic drug phencyclidine on the neurochemistry and function of the prefrontal cortex in vervet monkeys were investigated. Monkeys treated with phencyclidine twice a day for 14 days displayed performance deficits on a task that was sensitive to prefrontal cortex function; the deficits were ameliorated by the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine. Repeated exposure to phencyclidine caused a reduction in both basal and evoked dopamine utilization in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain region that has long been associated with cognitive function. Behavioral deficits and decreased dopamine utilization remained after phencyclidine treatment was stopped, an indication that these effects were not simply due to direct drug effects. The data suggest that repeated administration of phencyclidine in monkeys may be useful for studying psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction and dopamine hypofunction in the prefrontal cortex, particularly schizophrenia.
Mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV-4, the JHM strain), a positive-strand RNA virus of the coronavirus family, is well documented as an inducer of acute and chronic demyelination in mice, as well as subacute demyelination in rats, due to a cytolytic infection of oligodendrocytes. However, experiments to explore the role of virus and host factors in the production of chronic or recurrent demyelinating disease have been limited because MHV-4 usually produces demyelination in conditions that frequently induce a fatal necrotizing encephalomyelitis. To circumvent this problem, we had made and selected mutant viruses that caused both a high incidence of demyelination and a low incidence of encephalitis-induced mortality. One such mutant, designated ts8, consistently caused acute demyelinating disease in over 90% of intracerebrally or intranasally (natural route of infection) inoculated, 4-5 week-old mice from several susceptible strains within 6-10 days. In addition, ts8 typically did not cause fatal necrotizing encephalitis, showing a low mortality (less than 5%). This reflected a unique tropism of ts8 for oligodendrocytes, but a limited one for neuronal cells. We now report that ts8 is also useful for inducing persistent infection of the mouse central nervous system (CNS). The histopathological correlate of this infection is chronic recurrent demyelination, and virus can be demonstrated ultrastructurally in intact oligodendrocytes, in the vicinity of demyelinated areas.
The categorial nature of sensory, cognitive and behavioural acts indicates that the brain classifies neuronal activity patterns into discrete representations. Pattern classification may be achieved by abrupt switching between discrete activity states of neuronal circuits, but few experimental studies have directly tested this. We gradually varied the concentration or molecular identity of odours and optically measured responses across output neurons of the olfactory bulb in zebrafish. Whereas population activity patterns were largely insensitive to changes in odour concentration, morphing of one odour into another resulted in abrupt transitions between odour representations. These transitions were mediated by coordinated response changes among small neuronal ensembles rather than by shifts in the global network state. The olfactory bulb therefore classifies odour-evoked input patterns into many discrete and defined output patterns, as proposed by attractor models. This computation is consistent with perceptual phenomena and may represent a general information processing strategy in the brain.
The neural computations used to represent olfactory information in the brain have long been investigated. Recent studies in the insect antennal lobe suggest that precise temporal and/or spatial patterns of activity underlie the recognition and discrimination of different odours, and that these patterns may be strengthened by associative learning. It remains unknown, however, whether these activity patterns persist when odour intensity varies rapidly and unpredictably, as often occurs in nature. Here we show that with naturally intermittent odour stimulation, spike patterns recorded from moth antennal-lobe output neurons varied predictably with the fine-scale temporal dynamics and intensity of the odour. These data support the hypothesis that olfactory circuits compensate for contextual variations in the stimulus pattern with high temporal precision. The timing of output neuron activity is constantly modulated to reflect ongoing changes in stimulus intensity and dynamics that occur on a millisecond timescale.
Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease with complex clinical features. Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) maps to the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q25.2-q27) and is linked strongly to the markers D6S305 and D6S253; the former is deleted in one Japanese AR-JP patient. By positional cloning within this microdeletion, we have now isolated a complementary DNA done of 2,960 base pairs with a 1,395-base-pair open reading frame, encoding a protein of 465 amino acids with moderate similarity to ubiquitin at the amino terminus and a RING-finger motif at the carboxy terminus. The gene spans more than 500 kilobases and has 12 exons, five of which (exons 3-7) are deleted in the patient. Four other AR-JP patients from three unrelated families have a deletion affecting exon 4 alone. A 4.5-kilobase transcript that is expressed in many human tissues but is abundant in the brain, including the substantia nigra, is shorter in brain tissue from one of the groups of exon-4-deleted patients. Mutations in the newly identified gene appear to be responsible for the pathogenesis of AR-JP, and we have therefore named the protein product 'Parkin'.
Grafting of neural tissue has been used to investigate the ability of central nervous system (CNS) axons to elongate into peripheral nerve grafts; to investigate the growth characteristics of material transplanted within the CNS; and to determine if grafts producing amines or peptides can replace a natural or experimentally induced depletion of these biogenic molecules. In such experiments donor tissue has been distinguished from host by injection into graft cells of horseradish peroxidase or radioactive leucine or by detecting biogenic molecules in the grafted tissue with antibodies. All these methods have limitations and a technique which allows identification of the total neuronal cell output from transplanted tissue would be a powerful tool in delineating host-graft interactions. Polymorphic cell-surface antigens have not previously been exploited as markers. The Thy-1 antigen is an abundant glycoprotein of neurones and in the mouse exists in two allotypic forms called Thy-1.1 and Thy-1.2. We now show that tissue from Thy-1.1-positive animals grafted into Thy-1.1-negative brains can be clearly identified in cryostat sections using an anti-Thy-1.1 monoclonal antibody conjugated with peroxidase. We have used the method to study grafts from normal fetal mice which correct a developmental deficiency when transplanted into hpg mutant mice.
The mammalian brain comprises a number of functionally distinct systems. It might therefore be expected that natural selection on particular behavioural capacities would have caused size changes selectively, in the systems mediating those capacities. It has been claimed, however, that developmental constraints limited such mosaic evolution, causing co-ordinated size change among individual brain components. Here we analyse comparative data to demonstrate that mosaic change has been an important factor in brain structure evolution. First, the neocortex shows about a fivefold difference in volume between primates and insectivores even after accounting for its scaling relationship with the rest of the brain. Second, brain structures with major anatomical and functional links evolved together independently of evolutionary change in other structures. This is true at the level of both basic brain subdivisions and more fine-grained functional systems. Hence, brain evolution in these groups involved complex relationships among individual brain components.
Adenosine and its analogues are potent inhibitors of synaptic activity in the central and peripheral nervous system. In the central nervous system (CNS), this appears to arise primarily by inhibition of presynaptic release of transmitters, including glutamate, which is possibly the major excitatory transmitter in the brain. In addition, postsynaptic effects of adenosine have been reported which would also serve to reduce neurotransmission. The mechanism by which adenosine inhibits CNS neurotransmission is unknown, although it appears to exert its effect via an A1 receptor which in some systems is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition, we have examined the effect of pertussis toxin (PTX) on the ability of the stable adenosine analogue (-)phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) to inhibit glutamate release from cerebellar neurones maintained in primary culture. PTX, by ADP-ribosylating the nucleotide-binding protein Ni, prevents coupling of inhibitory receptors such as the A1 receptor to adenylate cyclase. As reported here, we found that PTX, as well as preventing inhibition of adenylate cyclase by PIA, also converts the PIA-induced inhibition of glutamate release to a stimulation. Our results suggest strongly that purinergic inhibitory modulation of transmitter release occurs by inhibition of adenylate cyclase.
A classic model proposes that the mammalian neocortex is divided into areas early in neurogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms that generate the area map have been elusive. Here we provide evidence that FGF8 regulates development of the map from a source in the anterior telencephalon. Using electroporation-mediated gene transfer in mouse embryos, we show that augmenting the endogenous anterior FGF8 signal shifts area boundaries posteriorly, reducing the signal shifts them anteriorly, and introducing a posterior source of FGF8 elicits partial area duplications, revealed by ectopic somatosensory barrel fields. These findings support a role for FGF signaling in specifying positional identity in the neocortex.
Visual experience is essential for the establishment of the cerebral cortical circuitry that allows normal binocular vision. For example, the pattern of right-eye, left-eye dominance columns is permanently altered by simply closing an eye of a young primate. A critical issue is whether environmental factors also influence the development of other cortical sensory areas. In the present experiments we manipulated the tactile experience of young rats by depriving them of the sensory information that is normally provided by their large facial whiskers. Electrophysiological analyses showed that simply trimming the whiskers from the day of birth results in pronounced abnormalities in the response properties of single neurons in the adult somatic sensory cortex. Thus functional plasticity in response to early experience appears to be a fundamental aspect of cortical development.
Long-term depression (LTD) is a well-known form of synaptic plasticity of principal neurons in the mammalian brain. Whether such changes occur in interneurons is still controversial. CA3 hippocampal interneurons expressing Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors exhibited LTD after tetanic stimulation of CA3 excitatory inputs. LTD was independent of NMDA receptors and required both Ca2+ influx through postsynaptic AMPA receptors and activation of presynaptic mGluR7-like receptors. These results point to the capability of interneurons to undergo plastic changes of synaptic strength through joint activation of pre- and postsynaptic glutamate receptors.
Lasting modifications of the receptive fields of neurons in the visual cortex can be induced by pairing visual stimuli with iontophoretic application of the neuromodulators acetylcholine and noradrenaline or the excitatory amino acids N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and L-glutamate. The modifications are obtained in less than 1 hour and persist for more than 40 minutes. Thus, acetylcholine and norepinephrine have a permissive role in use-dependent neuronal plasticity. These results support the notion of a postsynaptic threshold for neuronal malleability that differs from that of sodium-dependent action potentials.
Previous research has indicated that intracerebral injection of potassium chloride, and the resultant electrical silence of the brain, lead to the attenuation of a previously conditioned emotional response; this response may reflect conditioned fear. The data reported here indicate that the normal mobilization of corticosteroids, perhaps a second index of emotionality, is also attenuated by such injections.
Investigations using synaptosomes, pinched-off nerve ending particles from brain, have greatly improved our knowledge of presynaptic function. However, these structures, like most nerve endings, are too small to be penetrated with microelectrodes. We have treated synaptosomal preparations from rat brain with a neutral protease and obtained fused structures large enough to be recorded from directly with microelectrodes; we report here that these particles (30-250 microM in diameter) contain mitochondria and structures resembling synaptic vesicles, morphological features characteristic of synaptosomes. These 'giant synaptosomes' have resting membrane potentials in the range -45 to -76 mV, are depolarized by increasing concentrations of K+, show responses to a variety of neuroactive substances and exhibit active membrane responses to depolarizing current pulses. These results suggest that this preparation will be of value in further studies of nerve terminal function.
Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the most common intraneuronal inclusion in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and have been implicated in mediating neuronal death and cognitive deficits. Here, we found that mice expressing a repressible human tau variant developed progressive age-related NFTs, neuronal loss, and behavioral impairments. After the suppression of transgenic tau, memory function recovered, and neuron numbers stabilized, but to our surprise, NFTs continued to accumulate. Thus, NFTs are not sufficient to cause cognitive decline or neuronal death in this model of tauopathy.
Two neurotrophic factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), are able to produce a long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Unlike other forms of plasticity, neurotrophin-induced plasticity exhibited an immediate requirement for protein synthesis. Plasticity in rat hippocampal slices in which the synaptic neuropil was isolated from the principal cell bodies also required early protein synthesis. Thus, the neurotrophins may stimulate the synthesis of proteins in either axonal or dendritic compartments, allowing synapses to exert local control over the complement of proteins expressed at individual synaptic sites.
Cell surface molecules have been implicated in cell interactions which underlie formation of the nervous system. The analysis of the functional properties of such molecules has profited from the combined use of antibodies and cell culture systems. It has been suggested that the interplay between these molecules modulates cell-to-cell interaction at critical developmental stages. In the mouse, N-CAM and L1 antigen have been shown to mediate Ca2+-independent adhesion among neural cells. N-CAM plays a role in fasciculation of neurites and formation of neuromuscular junction. L1 is apparently not involved in synaptogenesis, but in migration of granule cell neurones in the developing mouse cerebellar cortex. The two antigens are distinct molecular and functional entities which act synergistically in aggregation of neuroblastoma and early postnatal cerebellar cells. In view of a certain similarity in function between the two groups of molecules, it was not surprising to find that structural similarities are detectable by the monoclonal antibody L2. We show here that a carbohydrate moiety recognized by L2 and HNK-1 monoclonal antibodies, is present in mouse N-CAM and L1. The L2 epitope appears on all major neural cell types but not all N-CAM molecules express it. This heterogeneity points to a previously undetected molecular diversity which may have functional implications for modulating cell adhesion during development.
Synchronized oscillations and inhibitory interneurons have important and interconnected roles within cortical microcircuits. In particular, interneurons defined by the fast-spiking phenotype and expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin have been suggested to be involved in gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations, which are hypothesized to enhance information processing. However, because parvalbumin interneurons cannot be selectively controlled, definitive tests of their functional significance in gamma oscillations, and quantitative assessment of the impact of parvalbumin interneurons and gamma oscillations on cortical circuits, have been lacking despite potentially enormous significance (for example, abnormalities in parvalbumin interneurons may underlie altered gamma-frequency synchronization and cognition in schizophrenia and autism). Here we use a panel of optogenetic technologies in mice to selectively modulate multiple distinct circuit elements in neocortex, alone or in combination. We find that inhibiting parvalbumin interneurons suppresses gamma oscillations in vivo, whereas driving these interneurons (even by means of non-rhythmic principal cell activity) is sufficient to generate emergent gamma-frequency rhythmicity. Moreover, gamma-frequency modulation of excitatory input in turn was found to enhance signal transmission in neocortex by reducing circuit noise and amplifying circuit signals, including inputs to parvalbumin interneurons. As demonstrated here, optogenetics opens the door to a new kind of informational analysis of brain function, permitting quantitative delineation of the functional significance of individual elements in the emergent operation and function of intact neural circuitry.
Immunohistochemical analysis of adenosine deaminase in rat brain revealed an extensive plexus of adenosine deaminase-containing neurons in the basal hypothalamus. These neurons converged on and were most numerous in three major centers, namely, the tuberal, caudal, and postmammillary caudal magnocellular nuclei. Most other brain regions were devoid of cells containing adenosine deaminase. Some adenosine deaminase-containing neurons were retrogradely labeled with the fluorescent dye fast blue when the dye was injected into the frontal cortex and striatum. Specific populations of neurons having high levels of adenosine deaminase may release adenosine as a neurotransmitter.
Lissencephaly (agyria-pachygyria) is a human brain malformation manifested by a smooth cerebral surface and abnormal neuronal migration. Identification of the gene(s) involved in this disorder would facilitate molecular dissection of normal events in brain development. Type 1 lissencephaly occurs either as an isolated abnormality or in association with dysmorphic facial appearance in patients with Miller-Dieker syndrome. About 15% of patients with isolated lissencephaly and more than 90% of patients with Miller-Dieker syndrome have microdeletions in a critical 350-kilobase region in chromosome 17p13.3 (ref. 6). These deletions are hemizygous, so haplo-insufficiency for a gene in this interval is implicated. Here we report the cloning of a gene (LIS-1, lissencephaly-1) in 17p13.3 that is deleted in Miller-Dieker patients. Non-overlapping deletions involving either the 5' or 3' end of the gene were found in two patients, identifying LIS-1 as the disease gene. The deduced amino-acid sequence shows significant homology to beta-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, suggesting that it could possibly be involved in a signal transduction pathway crucial for cerebral development.
Rats with electrolytic lesions in the septal forebrain show increased sleeping times after injection with thiopental sodium or barbital, as compared with normal and other control rats and rats with lesions in the cerebral cortex or caudate nucleus.
Our two eyes obtain slightly different views of the world. The resulting differences in the two retinal images, called binocular disparities, provide us with a stereoscopic sense of depth. The primary visual cortex (V1) contains neurons that are selective for the disparity of individual elements in an image, but this information must be further analysed to complete the stereoscopic process. Here we apply the psychophysical technique of reverse correlation to investigate disparity processing in human vision. Observers viewed binocular random-dot patterns, with 'signal' dots in a specific depth plane plus 'noise' dots with randomly assigned disparities. By examining the correlation between the observers' ability to detect the plane and the particular sample of 'noise' disparities presented on each trial, we revealed detection 'filters', whose disparity selectivity was remarkably similar to that of individual neurons in monkey V1. Moreover, if the noise dots were of opposite contrast in the two eyes, the tuning inverted, just like the response patterns of V1 neurons. Reverse correlation appears to probe disparity processing at the earliest stages of binocular combination, prior to the generation of a full stereoscopic depth percept.
Normal neuroglial cells buffer the extracellular space around neurons and presynaptic terminals against increases in potassium ions. Epileptic foci resulting from brain injury are characterized by areas of intense fibrillary gliosis bordering neuronal tissue. The known pathological changes that occur in gliosis may impair glial control of extracellular potassium ions and lead to excessively excitable neuronal border regions.
There is much interest in the evolutionary forces that favored the evolution of large brains in the primate order. The social brain hypothesis posits that selection has favored larger brains and more complex cognitive capacities as a means to cope with the challenges of social life. The hypothesis is supported by evidence that shows that group size is linked to various measures of brain size. But it has not been clear how cognitive complexity confers fitness advantages on individuals. Research in the field and laboratory shows that sophisticated social cognition underlies social behavior in primate groups. Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that the quality of social relationships has measurable fitness consequences for individuals.
Humans have a unique ability to learn more than one language--a skill that is thought to be mediated by functional (rather than structural) plastic changes in the brain. Here we show that learning a second language increases the density of grey matter in the left inferior parietal cortex and that the degree of structural reorganization in this region is modulated by the proficiency attained and the age at acquisition. This relation between grey-matter density and performance may represent a general principle of brain organization.
Glutamate uptake into glial cells helps to keep the brain extracellular glutamate concentration, [glu]o, below levels that kill neurons. Uptake is powered by the transmembrane gradients of Na+, K+ and pH. When the extracellular [K+] rises in brain ischaemia, uptake reverses, releasing glutamate into the extracellular space. Here we show, by monitoring glutamate transport electrically and detecting released glutamate with ion channels in neurons placed outside glial cells, that a raised [H+] inhibits both forward and reversed glutamate uptake. No electroneutral reversed uptake was detected, contradicting the idea that forward and reversed uptake differ fundamentally. Suppression of reversed uptake by the low pH occurring in ischaemia will slow the Ca(2+)-independent release of glutamate with can raise [glu]o to a neurotoxic level, and will thus protect the brain during a transient loss of blood supply.
A new class of excitatory premotor interneurons that are important in the generation of locomotion in the lamprey has now been described. In the isolated spinal cord, these neurons act simultaneously with their postsynaptic motoneurons during fictive swimming. They are small and numerous, and they monosynaptically excite both motoneurons and inhibitory premotor interneurons. The excitatory postsynaptic potentials are depressed by an antagonist of excitatory amino acids. These interneurons receive reticulospinal input from the brain stem and polysynaptic input form skin afferents. A model of the network underlying locomotion based on the synaptic interactions of these neurons can now be proposed for the lamprey.
Beta-galactosidase-deficient siblings in two litters of English springer spaniel puppies showed a progressive neurological impairment, dwarfism, orbital hypertelorism, and dysostosis multiplex. An excess of GM1-ganglioside was found in the brain. Three abnormal oligosaccharides were present in samples of urine, brain, liver, and cartilage. Light microscopy of selected tissue specimens revealed cytoplasmic vacuoles in neurons, circulating blood cells, macrophages, and chondrocytes. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that these membrane-bound vacuoles were of two types--one containing lamellated membranes and the other, finely granular material. These clinical and pathological findings are similar to those observed in human patients affected by the infantile form of GM1-gangliosidosis.
In the Research News article "Pot, heroin unlock new areas for neuroscience" by Marcia Barinaga (18 Dec., p. 1882), the diagram of the molecule anandamide on page 1883 was incorrect. The correct structure appears on page 1948 of the same issue, in figure 1A of the report "Isolation and structure of a brain constituent that binds to the cannabinoid receptor" by W. A. Devane et al. (p. 1946).
The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) contains neurons that are part of the central neuronal network controlling rhythmic breathing movements in mammals. Nerve terminals within the NTS show immunoreactivity to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a neuropeptide that has potent stimulatory effects on respiration. By means of a brainstem slice preparation in vitro, TRH induced rhythmic bursting in neurons in the respiratory division of the NTS. The frequency of bursting was voltage-dependent and could be reset by short depolarizing current pulses. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, TRH produced rhythmic oscillations in membrane potential whose frequency was also voltage-dependent. These observations suggest that TRH modulates the membrane excitability of NTS neurons and allows them to express endogenous bursting activity.
Dramatic advances in neuroscience are changing and enriching our understanding of brain and behaviour. But reductionist interpretations of these advances can cause great harm.
A beta 1-40, a major component of Alzheimer's disease cerebral amyloid, is present in the cerebrospinal fluid and remains relatively soluble at high concentrations (less than or equal to 3.7 mM). Thus, physiological factors which induce A beta amyloid formation could provide clues to the pathogenesis of the disease. It has been shown that human A beta specifically and saturably binds zinc. Here, concentrations of zinc above 300 nM rapidly destabilized human A beta 1-40 solutions, inducing tinctorial amyloid formation. However, rat A beta 1-40 binds zinc less avidly and is immune to these effects, perhaps explaining the scarcity with which these animals form cerebral A beta amyloid. These data suggest a role for cerebral zinc metabolism in the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Peptide and protein hormones usually considered as being of pituitary origin have been detected within the central nervous system by means of radioimmunoassay, bioassay, and immunocytochemical techniques. Intracerebral administration of some of these hormones or fragments thereof elicit behavioral responses, suggesting that they may have a physiological role similar to that described for other peptidergic neurotransmitter or neuromodulator substances. Evidence available for some of these hormones indicates that they are synthesized within the central nervous system and that their regulation may differ from that of their pituitary counterparts.
Somatostatin receptors in rat brain, pituitary, and pancreas were labeled with two radioiodinated analogs of somatostatins 14 and 28. Two cyclic analogs of somatostatin, SMS201-995 and cyclo(Ala-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys), showed biphasic displacement of binding to somatostatin receptors by these radioligands. In contrast, all other somatostatin analogs, including somatostatin-14, competed for the receptor sites with monophasic displacement of radioligand receptor binding. Thus two types of somatostatin receptors were identified. It was found that the pituitary and pancreas have predominantly one type of somatostatin receptor whereas the brain has both, and that different regions of the brain have various proportions of the two types. These findings suggest methods to characterize other types of somatostatin receptors subserving somatostatin's diverse physiological functions, including a potential role in cognitive function and extrapyramidal motor system control.
The neuropeptide somatostatin inhibits secretion from electrically excitable cells in the pituitary, pancreas, gut and brain. In mammalian pituitary tumour cells somatostatin inhibits secretion through two distinct pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanisms. One involves inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, the other an unidentified cyclic AMP-independent mechanism that reduces Ca2+ influx by increasing membrane conductance to potassium. Here we demonstrate that the predominant electrophysiological effect of somatostatin on metabolically intact pituitary tumour cells is a large, sustained increase in the activity of the large-conductance Ca(2+)- and voltage-activated K+ channels (BK). This action of somatostatin does not involve direct effects of Ca2+, cAMP or G proteins on the channels. Our results indicate instead that somatostatin stimulates BK channel activity through protein dephosphorylation.
The paired helical filament (PHF) is the major component of the neurofibrillary deposits that form a defining neuropathological characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. PHFs are composed of microtubule-associated protein tau, in a hyperphosphorylated state. Hyperphosphorylation of tau results in its inability to bind to microtubules and is believed to precede PHF assembly. However, it is unclear whether hyperphosphorylation of tau is either necessary or sufficient for PHF formation. Here we show that non-phosphorylated recombinant tau isoforms with three microtubule-binding repeats form paired helical-like filaments under physiological conditions in vitro, when incubated with sulphated glycosaminoglycans such as heparin or heparan sulphate. Furthermore, heparin prevents tau from binding to microtubules and promotes microtubule disassembly. Finally, we show that heparan sulphate and hyperphosphorylated tau coexist in nerve cells of the Alzheimer's disease brain at the earliest known stages of neurofibrillary pathology. These findings, with previous studies which show that heparin stimulates tau phosphorylation by a number of protein kinases, indicate that sulphated glycosaminoglycans may be a key factor in the formation of the neurofibrillary lesions of Alzheimer's disease.
Endogenous phospholipase A2 activity of brain synaptic vesicles was Ca2+ -dependent and was increased by prostaglandin F2 alpha, calmodulin, adenosine 3', 5' -monophosphate, and adenosine triphosphate, whereas the activity was inhibited by prostaglandin E2 in the absence or presence of calmodulin. Light-scattering measurements demonstrated that stimulation of the enzyme's activity correlated with the induction of vesicle-vesicle aggregation. The effects of these compounds on endogenous synaptic vesicle phospholipase A2 activity may imply a common end point of their purported neuromodulatory actions, and indicate that synaptic vesicle phospholipase A2 may play a central role in presynaptic neurotransmission.
Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by extensive neuron death that leads to functional decline, but the neurobiological correlates of functional decline in normal aging are less well defined. For decades, it has been a commonly held notion that widespread neuron death in the neocortex and hippocampus is an inevitable concomitant of brain aging, but recent quantitative studies suggest that neuron death is restricted in normal aging and unlikely to account for age-related impairment of neocortical and hippocampal functions. In this article, the qualitative and quantitative differences between aging and Alzheimer's disease with respect to neuron loss are discussed, and age-related changes in functional and biochemical attributes of hippocampal circuits that might mediate functional decline in the absence of neuron death are explored. When these data are viewed comprehensively, it appears that the primary neurobiological substrates for functional impairment in aging differ in important ways from those in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
The N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) and the soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs) appear to be essential components of the intracellular membrane fusion apparatus. An affinity purification procedure based on the natural binding of these proteins to their targets was used to isolate SNAP receptors (SNAREs) from bovine brain. Remarkably, the four principal proteins isolated were all proteins associated with the synapse, with one type located in the synaptic vesicle and another in the plasma membrane, suggesting a simple mechanism for vesicle docking. The existence of numerous SNARE-related proteins, each apparently specific for a single kind of vesicle or target membrane, indicates that NSF and SNAPs may be universal components of a vesicle fusion apparatus common to both constitutive and regulated fusion (including neurotransmitter release), in which the SNAREs may help to ensure vesicle-to-target specificity.
Microinjections of the excitatory neurotoxin kainic acid into the lateral hypothalamus of rats produced a period aphagia and adipsia. Kainate-treated rats displayed transient motor effects during the first hours after the injection but did not show the persisting sensory-motor and arousal disturbances typically observed in animals with electrolytic lesions in this part of the hypothalamus. Histological examination revealed a significant reduction in the number of nerve cell bodies in the lateral hypothalamus. Silver-stained material indicated no evidence of damage to fiber systems passing through the affected region. Assays of dopamine in hypothalamus, striatum, and telencephalon did not indicate significant differences between experimental and control animals. These results are in agreement with recent reports of the anatomical and biochemical effects of intracerebral kainic acid injections and suggest that the observed effect on feeding behavior is related to the destruction of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus.
Axons in the cerebral cortex receive synaptic input at the axon initial segment almost exclusively from gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing (GABAergic) axo-axonic cells (AACs). The axon has the lowest threshold for action potential generation in neurons; thus, AACs are considered to be strategically placed inhibitory neurons controlling neuronal output. However, we found that AACs can depolarize pyramidal cells and can initiate stereotyped series of synaptic events in rat and human cortical networks because of a depolarized reversal potential for axonal relative to perisomatic GABAergic inputs. Excitation and signal propagation initiated by AACs is supported by the absence of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 in the axon.
Animals process sensory information according to specific computational rules and, subsequently, form representations of their environments that form the basis for decisions and choices. The specific computational rules used by organisms will often be evolutionarily adaptive by generating higher probabilities of survival, reproduction, and resource acquisition. Experiments with enclosed colonies of bumblebees constrained to foraging on artificial flowers suggest that the bumblebee's cognitive architecture is designed to efficiently exploit floral resources from spatially structured environments given limits on memory and the neuronal processing of information. A non-linear relationship between the biomechanics of nectar extraction and rates of net energetic gain by individual bees may account for sensitivities to both the arithmetic mean and variance in reward distributions in flowers. Heuristic rules that lead to efficient resource exploitation may also lead to subjective misperception of likelihoods. Subjective probability formation may then be viewed as a problem in pattern recognition subject to specific sampling schemes and memory constraints.
Lysergic acid diethylamide increased acetylation of histones in rabbit cerebral hemispheres and midbrain 30 minutes after intravenous administration of the drug at doses of 10 and 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. Evidence for the stimulation of acetylation in individual histone bands was obtained after separation by electrophoresis on polyacrylamied gels.
Grid cells provide a neural representation of space, by discharging when an animal traverses through the vertices of a periodic hexagonal grid spanning the environment. Although grid cells have been characterized in detail in rats, the fundamental question of what neural dynamics give rise to the grid structure remains unresolved. Two competing classes of models were proposed: network models, based on attractor dynamics, and oscillatory interference models, which propose that interference between somatic and dendritic theta-band oscillations (4-10 Hz) in single neurons transforms a temporal oscillation into a spatially periodic grid. So far, these models could not be dissociated experimentally, because rodent grid cells always co-exist with continuous theta oscillations. Here we used a novel animal model, the Egyptian fruit bat, to refute the proposed causal link between grids and theta oscillations. On the basis of our previous finding from bat hippocampus, of spatially tuned place cells in the absence of continuous theta oscillations, we hypothesized that grid cells in bat medial entorhinal cortex might also exist without theta oscillations. Indeed, we found grid cells in bat medial entorhinal cortex that shared remarkable similarities to rodent grid cells. Notably, the grids existed in the absence of continuous theta-band oscillations, and with almost no theta modulation of grid-cell spiking--both of which are essential prerequisites of the oscillatory interference models. Our results provide a direct demonstration of grid cells in a non-rodent species. Furthermore, they strongly argue against a major class of computational models of grid cells.
The heterocyclic compound kainic acid (KA) is a potent excitant when applied to mammalian neurones. Lesions caused by injections of KA into the rat striatum and hippocampus cause similar patterns of damage to those seen in Huntington's chorea and status epilepticus, respectively. Although it was originally thought to be a glutamate agonist, it is now clear that KA does not act on the majority of the receptors for glutamate, and in fact seems to act on a class of receptors which are distinct from those which mediate responses to other excitatory amino acids. The potent and selective neurotoxic effects of this compound may be mediated by these same receptors. At present, the relative distribution of junctional and extrajunctional (non-synaptic) receptors is unknown and resolution of this issue would provide important insights into the action of KA on the central nervous system (CNS). We show here that KA binding sites are greatly enriched in isolated synaptic junctions from rat brain and, using an in vitro autoradiographic technique, we have found that these binding sites are concentrated specifically in terminal fields where KA acts as a potent neurotoxin.
A central controversy in current research on visual attention is whether figures are segregated from their background preattentively, or whether attention is first directed to unstructured regions of the image. Here we present neurological evidence for the former view from studies of a brain-injured patient with visual neglect. His attentional impairment arises after normal segmentation of the image into figures and background has taken place. Our results indicate that information which is neglected and unavailable to higher levels of visual processing can nevertheless be processed by earlier stages in the visual system concerned with segmentation.
The behavioral, cognitive, and electrophysiological effect of a single dose of dextroamphetamine (0.5 milligram per kilogram of body weight) or placebo was examined in 14 normal prepubertal boys (mean age, 10 years 11 months) in a double-blind study. When amphetamine was given, the group showed a marked decrease in motor activity and reaction time and improved performance on cognitive tests. The similarity of the response observed in normal children to that reported in children with "hyperactivity" or minimal brain dysfunction casts doubt on pathophysiological models of minimal brain dysfunction which assume that children with this syndrome have a clinically specific or "paradoxical" response to stimulants.
When we look at our hands, we immediately know that they are part of our own body. This feeling of ownership of our limbs is a fundamental aspect of self-consciousness. We have studied the neuronal counterparts of this experience. A perceptual illusion was used to manipulate feelings of ownership of a rubber hand presented in front of healthy subjects while brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The neural activity in the premotor cortex reflected the feeling of ownership of the hand. This suggests that multisensory integration in the premotor cortex provides a mechanism for bodily self-attribution.
The subplate forms a transient circuit required for development of connections between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. When subplate neurons are ablated, ocular dominance columns do not form in the visual cortex despite the robust presence of thalamic axons in layer 4. We show that subplate ablation also prevents formation of orientation columns. Visual responses are weak and poorly tuned to orientation. Furthermore, thalamocortical synaptic transmission fails to strengthen, whereas intracortical synapses are unaffected. Thus, subplate circuits are essential not only for the anatomical segregation of thalamic inputs but also for key steps in synaptic remodeling and maturation needed to establish the functional architecture of visual cortex.
Cells were recorded in the midbrain central gray neuropil of the cat that responded with action potentials only during fighting behavior and not while the cat was resting or while control manipulations were performed. Some other cells in the same region responded maximally during fighting, and all cells responded to at least one manipulation. Brain stimulation at sites of cells related to fighting caused the animals to hiss.
Study of the neurobiology of learning and memory is in a most exciting phase. Behavioral studies in animals are characterizing the categories and properties of learning and memory; essential memory trace circuits in the brain are being defined and localized in mammalian models; work on human memory and the brain is identifying neuronal systems involved in memory; the neuronal, neurochemical, molecular, and biophysical substrates of memory are beginning to be understood in both invertebrate and vertebrate systems; and theoretical and mathematical analysis of basic associative learning and of neuronal networks in proceeding apace. Likely applications of this new understanding of the neural bases of learning and memory range from education to the treatment of learning disabilities to the design of new artificial intelligence systems.
Locomotion and reaching have traditionally been regarded as separate motor activities. In fact, they may be closely connected both from an evolutionary and a neurophysiological viewpoint. Reaching seems to have evolved from the neural systems responsible for the active and precise positioning of the limb during locomotion; moreover, it seems to be organized in the spinal cord. The motor cortex and its corticospinal outflow are preferentially engaged when precise positioning of the limb is needed during locomotion and are also involved during reaching and active positioning of the hand near objects of interest. All of these motor activities require visuomotor coordination, and it is this coordination that could be achieved by the motor cortex and interconnected parietal and cerebellar areas.
The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has a crucial role in emotional learning irrespective of valence. The BLA projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to modulate cue-triggered motivated behaviours, but our understanding of the interaction between these two brain regions has been limited by the inability to manipulate neural-circuit elements of this pathway selectively during behaviour. To circumvent this limitation, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of glutamatergic fibres from the BLA to the NAc, coupled with intracranial pharmacology and ex vivo electrophysiology. Here we show that optical stimulation of the pathway from the BLA to the NAc in mice reinforces behavioural responding to earn additional optical stimulation of these synaptic inputs. Optical stimulation of these glutamatergic fibres required intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signalling, but not D2-type receptor signalling. Brief optical inhibition of fibres from the BLA to the NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose, demonstrating an important role of this specific pathway in controlling naturally occurring reward-related behaviour. Moreover, although optical stimulation of glutamatergic fibres from the medial prefrontal cortex to the NAc also elicited reliable excitatory synaptic responses, optical self-stimulation behaviour was not observed by activation of this pathway. These data indicate that whereas the BLA is important for processing both positive and negative affect, the glutamatergic pathway from the BLA to the NAc, in conjunction with dopamine signalling in the NAc, promotes motivated behavioural responding. Thus, optogenetic manipulation of anatomically distinct synaptic inputs to the NAc reveals functionally distinct properties of these inputs in controlling reward-seeking behaviours.
Humans normally experience the conscious self as localized within their bodily borders. This spatial unity may break down in certain neurological conditions such as out-of-body experiences, leading to a striking disturbance of bodily self-consciousness. On the basis of these clinical data, we designed an experiment that uses conflicting visual-somatosensory input in virtual reality to disrupt the spatial unity between the self and the body. We found that during multisensory conflict, participants felt as if a virtual body seen in front of them was their own body and mislocalized themselves toward the virtual body, to a position outside their bodily borders. Our results indicate that spatial unity and bodily self-consciousness can be studied experimentally and are based on multisensory and cognitive processing of bodily information.
The hormone relaxin has recently been shown to inhibit not only uterine muscle contraction, but also the release of oxytocin into the plasma. Intravenous injection of porcine relaxin in anaesthetized lactating rats inhibits milk ejection and injection of relaxin into the cerebral ventricles disturbs the pattern of the milk ejection reflex. Recent experiments performed in vivo indicate that relaxin might act not only in the uterus, but also in the hypothalamus and possibly in the neurohypophysis. We tested this hypothesis in vitro by studying the effect of relaxin on hormone release from isolated neural lobes of the pituitary and isolated neurosecretory nerve endings of the neurohypophysis from the rat. We report here that relaxin has a dual effect on neurohypophysial hormone secretion. Under basal conditions, vasopressin and oxytocin release was inhibited by relaxin but, when the nerve endings were depolarized, vasopressin and oxytocin secretion was potentiated. We also found that relaxin acts at a stage before the increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ that is necessary for inducing hormone release, possibly by gating the calcium channel.
In rats subjected to thyroidectomy there was a two- to fourfold increase in cerebral cortex iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase activity within 24 hours. This increase was prevented by thyroxine replacement. The increased cortical 5'-deiodinase in chronically hypothyroid rats was normalized within 4 hours by a single intravenous injection of triiodothyronine. These results indicate that the adult central nervous system can give a very rapid biochemical response to thyroid hormone.
Human choices are remarkably susceptible to the manner in which options are presented. This so-called "framing effect" represents a striking violation of standard economic accounts of human rationality, although its underlying neurobiology is not understood. We found that the framing effect was specifically associated with amygdala activity, suggesting a key role for an emotional system in mediating decision biases. Moreover, across individuals, orbital and medial prefrontal cortex activity predicted a reduced susceptibility to the framing effect. This finding highlights the importance of incorporating emotional processes within models of human choice and suggests how the brain may modulate the effect of these biasing influences to approximate rationality.
Monoamine oxidase activity was higher in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia of patients dying from Huntington's disease than in controls. Enzyme kinetics and multiple substrate studies indicated that the increased activity was due to elevated concentrations of monoamine oxidase type B. Concentrations of homovanillic acid were increased in the cerebral cortex but not in the basal ganglia of brains of patients with Huntington's disease. These changes may represent a primary aminergic lesion that could underlie some of the mental symptoms of this disease.
Catechol estrogens have been identified and measured in rat brain and various endocrine tissues with the use of a sensitive radioenzymatic assay. The specificity of this assay was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography and mass spectral analysis of the reaction products. The concentration of catechol estrogens in the hypothalamus and pituitary are at least ten times higher than reported previously for the parent estrogens. Catechol estrogens have potent endocrine effects and, because of their normal occurrence in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, they have an important role in neuroendocrine regulation.
Although previous analyses indicate that neocortical neurons originate from the cortical proliferative zone, evidence suggests that a subpopulation of neocortical interneurons originates within the subcortical telencephalon. For example, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-expressing cells migrate in vitro from the subcortical telencephalon into the neocortex. The number of GABA-expressing cells in neocortical slices is reduced by separating the neocortex from the subcortical telencephalon. Finally, mice lacking the homeodomain proteins DLX-1 and DLX-2 show no detectable cell migration from the subcortical telencephalon to the neocortex and also have few GABA-expressing cells in the neocortex.
Complex repetitive-spike or slow-wave discharges can be evoked, and can also occur spontaneously, in small clusters of neurons which reaggregate in vitro after dissociation of cerebral cortex, brainstem, or spinal cord from the fetal mouse. Even after random dispersion in culture, these cells still form functional synaptic networks with bioelectric discharge patterns and pharmacologic sensitivities characteristic of the organ (that is, organotypic).
Vertebrates achieve internal homeostasis during infection or injury by balancing the activities of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), produced by all gram-negative bacteria, activates macrophages to release cytokines that are potentially lethal. The central nervous system regulates systemic inflammatory responses to endotoxin through humoral mechanisms. Activation of afferent vagus nerve fibres by endotoxin or cytokines stimulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal anti-inflammatory responses. However, comparatively little is known about the role of efferent vagus nerve signalling in modulating inflammation. Here, we describe a previously unrecognized, parasympathetic anti-inflammatory pathway by which the brain modulates systemic inflammatory responses to endotoxin. Acetylcholine, the principle vagal neurotransmitter, significantly attenuated the release of cytokines (tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and IL-18), but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human macrophage cultures. Direct electrical stimulation of the peripheral vagus nerve in vivo during lethal endotoxaemia in rats inhibited TNF synthesis in liver, attenuated peak serum TNF amounts, and prevented the development of shock.
Chromogranin A is contained in storage vesicles of chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and released with catecholamines when the splanchnic nerve is stimulated. Chromogranin A is similar to secretory protein I (SP-I), a major secreted protein of the parathyroid. Chromogranin A/SP-I immunoreactivity is abundant in endocrine cells that secrete peptide hormones from storage vesicles. Chromogranins may act in neuroendocrine secretion by binding intravesicular calcium. Serum levels of chromogranin are raised in hypertension and endocrine neoplasia. We report here the isolation and sequencing of a cDNA encoding bovine chromogranin A, providing the first complete primary structure of a chromogranin protein. Chromogranin A is a highly acidic protein with an apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) of 75,000 on SDS-PAGE, but an actual Mr of 48,000. Adrenal medulla, brain, pituitary and parathyroid are all sites of synthesis of chromogranin A. The primary structure of chromogranin A, and the presence of chromogranin mRNA in the parathyroid, indicate that chromogranin A and SP-I are identical.
The adult cortex is thought to undergo plastic changes that are closely dependent on neuronal activity (reviewed in ref. 1), although it is not yet known what molecules are involved. Neurotrophins and their receptors have been implicated in several aspects of developmental plasticity, and their expression in the adult cortex suggests additional roles in adult plasticity. To examine these potential roles in vivo, we used intrinsic-signal optical imaging to quantify the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on the functional representation of a stimulated whisker in the 'barrel' subdivision of the rat somatosensory cortex. Topical application of BDNF resulted in a rapid and long-lasting decrease in the size of a whisker representation, and a decrease in the amplitude of the activity-dependent intrinsic signal. In contrast, NGF application resulted in a rapid but transient increase in the size of a representation, and an increase in the amplitude of the activity-dependent intrinsic signal. These results demonstrate that neurotrophins can rapidly modulate stimulus-dependent activity in adult cortex, and suggest a role for neurotrophins in regulating adult cortical plasticity.
Object-centered spatial awareness--awareness of the location, relative to an object, of its parts--plays an important role in many aspects of perception, imagination, and action. One possible basis for this capability is the existence in the brain of neurons with sensory receptive fields or motor action fields that are defined relative to an object-centered frame. In experiments described here, neuronal activity was monitored in the supplementary eye field of macaque monkeys making eye movements to the right or left end of a horizontal bar. Neurons were found to fire differentially as a function of the end of the bar to which an eye movement was made. This is direct evidence for the existence of neurons sensitive to the object-centered direction of movements.
Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep consists of a dreaming state in which there is activation of the cortical and hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG), rapid eye movements, and loss of muscle tone. Although REM sleep was discovered more than 50 years ago, the neuronal circuits responsible for switching between REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep remain poorly understood. Here we propose a brainstem flip-flop switch, consisting of mutually inhibitory REM-off and REM-on areas in the mesopontine tegmentum. Each side contains GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-ergic neurons that heavily innervate the other. The REM-on area also contains two populations of glutamatergic neurons. One set projects to the basal forebrain and regulates EEG components of REM sleep, whereas the other projects to the medulla and spinal cord and regulates atonia during REM sleep. The mutually inhibitory interactions of the REM-on and REM-off areas may form a flip-flop switch that sharpens state transitions and makes them vulnerable to sudden, unwanted transitions-for example, in narcolepsy.
'Brain training', or the goal of improved cognitive function through the regular use of computerized tests, is a multimillion-pound industry, yet in our view scientific evidence to support its efficacy is lacking. Modest effects have been reported in some studies of older individuals and preschool children, and video-game players outperform non-players on some tests of visual attention. However, the widely held belief that commercially available computerized brain-training programs improve general cognitive function in the wider population in our opinion lacks empirical support. The central question is not whether performance on cognitive tests can be improved by training, but rather, whether those benefits transfer to other untrained tasks or lead to any general improvement in the level of cognitive functioning. Here we report the results of a six-week online study in which 11,430 participants trained several times each week on cognitive tasks designed to improve reasoning, memory, planning, visuospatial skills and attention. Although improvements were observed in every one of the cognitive tasks that were trained, no evidence was found for transfer effects to untrained tasks, even when those tasks were cognitively closely related.
Little is known about the mechanisms that allow the cortex to selectively improve the neural representations of behaviorally important stimuli while ignoring irrelevant stimuli. Diffuse neuromodulatory systems may facilitate cortical plasticity by acting as teachers to mark important stimuli. This study demonstrates that episodic electrical stimulation of the nucleus basalis, paired with an auditory stimulus, results in a massive progressive reorganization of the primary auditory cortex in the adult rat. Receptive field sizes can be narrowed, broadened, or left unaltered depending on specific parameters of the acoustic stimulus paired with nucleus basalis activation. This differential plasticity parallels the receptive field remodeling that results from different types of behavioral training. This result suggests that input characteristics may be able to drive appropriate alterations of receptive fields independently of explicit knowledge of the task. These findings also suggest that the basal forebrain plays an active instructional role in representational plasticity.
High-affinity binding of 3H-diazepam and 3H-flunitrazepam has provided evidence for the presence of benzodiazepine receptors on brain neurones. Pharmacological evidence showing a clear correlation between receptor affinity and in vivo pharmacological potency for several benzodiazepines and a link between benzodiazepine receptors and GABA (gamma-amino-butyric acid) receptors at the molecular level, indicates that these receptors are relevant to the pharmacological and clinical effects of benzodiazepines. In searching for possible endogeneous ligands for benzodiazepine receptors we have recently isolated ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) found human urine and brain, and shown that beta-CCE has a higher affinity than diazepam for brain benzodiazepine receptors. beta-CCE itself is probably not present in the brain, but may be closely related to an endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligand. We report here that beta-CCE, in contrast to benzodiazepines, can distinguish clearly between benzodiazepine receptors in cerebellum and hippocampus. This result strongly indicates that benzodiazepine receptors are not a single class of non-interacting entities. It has not been possible to determine whether two distinct receptors are present and/or whether true negative cooperativity exists among hippocampal, but not cerebellar, benzodiazepine receptors.
Non-human primates are valuable for modelling human disorders and for developing therapeutic strategies; however, little work has been reported in establishing transgenic non-human primate models of human diseases. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairment, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric disturbances followed by death within 10-15 years of the onset of the symptoms. HD is caused by the expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG, translated into glutamine) trinucleotide repeats in the first exon of the human huntingtin (HTT) gene. Mutant HTT with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) is widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues, but causes selective neurodegeneration that is most prominent in the striatum and cortex of the brain. Although rodent models of HD have been developed, these models do not satisfactorily parallel the brain changes and behavioural features observed in HD patients. Because of the close physiological, neurological and genetic similarities between humans and higher primates, monkeys can serve as very useful models for understanding human physiology and diseases. Here we report our progress in developing a transgenic model of HD in a rhesus macaque that expresses polyglutamine-expanded HTT. Hallmark features of HD, including nuclear inclusions and neuropil aggregates, were observed in the brains of the HD transgenic monkeys. Additionally, the transgenic monkeys showed important clinical features of HD, including dystonia and chorea. A transgenic HD monkey model may open the way to understanding the underlying biology of HD better, and to the development of potential therapies. Moreover, our data suggest that it will be feasible to generate valuable non-human primate models of HD and possibly other human genetic diseases.
Enkephalin, applied microiontophoretically, depressed spontaneous and glutamate-induced firing of single neurons in frontal cortex, caudate nucleus, and periaqueductal gray matter, where enkephalin and high concentrations of opiate receptors are found. Many of the depressions were blocked by the specific narcotic antagonist naloxone. The data are compatible with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role for this new brain pentapeptide.
The cerebral and cerebellar cortices of man are richly provided with varicose noradrenaline nerve terminals, which are visualized by fluorescence histochemistry of brain smears obtained by a new technique. The density of such nerves in human cortices equals that of the rat. The method permits simple and rapid analysis of noradrenergic nerves of the human cortex during routine neurosurgical operations.
Do changes in neuronal structure underlie cortical plasticity? Here we used time-lapse two-photon microscopy of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of developing rat barrel cortex to image the structural dynamics of dendritic spines and filopodia. We found that these protrusions were highly motile: spines and filopodia appeared, disappeared or changed shape over tens of minutes. To test whether sensory experience drives this motility we trimmed whiskers one to three days before imaging. Sensory deprivation markedly (approximately 40%) reduced protrusive motility in deprived regions of the barrel cortex during a critical period around postnatal days (P)11-13, but had no effect in younger (P8-10) or older (P14-16) animals. Unexpectedly, whisker trimming did not change the density, length or shape of spines and filopodia. However, sensory deprivation during the critical period degraded the tuning of layer 2/3 receptive fields. Thus sensory experience drives structural plasticity in dendrites, which may underlie the reorganization of neural circuits.
An object's global, three-dimensional structure may be represented by a specialized brain system involving regions of inferior temporal cortex. This system's role in object representation can be understood by experiments in which people study drawings of novel objects with possible or impossible three-dimensional structures, and later make either possible/impossible object decisions or old/new recognition decisions about briefly flashed studied and non-studied objects. Although object decisions about possible objects are facilitated by prior study, there is no corresponding facilitation for impossible objects, thereby implicating a system that is specifically involved in the representation of structurally coherent visual objects. Here we show, by positron emission tomography (PET), that increases in blood flow in inferior temporal regions are associated with object decisions about possible but not impossible objects, and that there are increases in the vicinity of the hippocampal formation associated with episodic recognition of possible objects.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool for investigating human brain function, but the relationship between the hemodynamically based fMRI signals in the human brain and the underlying neuronal activity is unclear. We recorded single unit activity and local field potentials in auditory cortex of two neurosurgical patients and compared them with the fMRI signals of 11 healthy subjects during presentation of an identical movie segment. The predicted fMRI signals derived from single units and the measured fMRI signals from auditory cortex showed a highly significant correlation (r = 0.75, P < 10(-47)). Thus, fMRI signals can provide a reliable measure of the firing rate of human cortical neurons.
In an infant rhesus monkey brain damage resulted from subcutaneously administered monosodium glutamate. Although a relatively high dose of monosodium glutamate was used, the infant was asymptomatic for a 3-hour observation period during which time hypothalamic neurons were undergoing a process of acute cell death. With the electron microscope it was observed that dendrites and cell bodies of neurons are the tissue components primarily affected in brain damage induced by monosodium glutamate.
The coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), causes mild encephalitis and chronic demyelination. Immunohistochemical techniques showed that MHV-A59-infected C57BL/6 mice contained dense deposits of viral antigen in the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra, with fewer signs of infection in other regions of the brain. The animals showed extra- and intracellular vacuolation, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the subthalamic-nigral region. Such localization is unprecedented among known viral encephalitides of humans and other species. This infection by a member of a viral class capable of causing both encephalitis and persistent infection in several species may be related to postencephalitic parkinsonism.
The human prion diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome (GSS), are neurodegenerative diseases that are unique in being both infectious and genetic. Transmission of both diseases and the animal spongiform encephalopathies (for example, scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy) to experimental animals by intracerebral inoculation with brain homogenates is well documented. Despite their experimental transmissibility, missense and insertional mutations in the prion protein gene are associated with both GSS and familial CJD, demonstrating that the human familial cases are autosomal dominant diseases. More than 80% of CJD cases occur sporadically, however, and are not known to be associated with mutations. Here we report that 21 of 22 sporadic CJD cases and a further 19 of 23 suspected sporadic CJD cases are homozygous at the polymorphic amino-acid residue 129; 51% of the normal population are heterozygous at this site. We argue that homozygosity predisposes towards sporadic CJD and that this directly supports the hypothesis that interaction between prion protein molecules underlies the disease process.
Reward is important for shaping goal-directed behaviour. After stimulus-reward associative learning, an organism can assess the motivational value of the incoming stimuli on the basis of past experience (retrospective processing), and predict forthcoming rewarding events (prospective processing). The traditional role of the sensory thalamus is to relay current sensory information to cortex. Here we find that non-primary thalamic neurons respond to reward-related events in two ways. The early, phasic responses occurred shortly after the onset of the stimuli and depended on the sensory modality. Their magnitudes resisted extinction and correlated with the learning experience. The late responses gradually increased during the cue and delay periods, and peaked just before delivery of the reward. These responses were independent of sensory modality and were modulated by the value and timing of the reward. These observations provide new evidence that single thalamic neurons can code for the acquired significance of sensory stimuli in the early responses (retrospective coding) and predict upcoming reward value in the late responses (prospective coding).
In the feline visual system, neurons exhibiting sensitivity to the length of a moving contour were first observed in the cortex and described as 'hypercomplex cells'. In these cells an increase in stimulus length beyond an optimal value leads to a rapid decline in response. This decline has been attributed to an intracortical inhibitory input which may be driven by layer VI cells with very long receptive fields. It is now clear, however, that cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), exhibit a degree of length tuning similar to that of cortical 'hypercomplex cells', suggesting that this response property could be generated subcortically. Alternatively, as the dLGN receives a massive corticofugal projection from layer VI cells in the visual cortex, it is possible that this input has a function in generating length tuning in the dLGN. We have investigated this issue by comparing the length tuning of dLGN cells with and without corticofugal feedback. The data show that corticofugal feedback makes a highly significant contribution to the length tuning of dLGN cells. This raises the possibility that length tuning is an emergent property of the geniculo-cortical loop.
A current hypothesis links the neuroexcitatory properties of certain acidic amino acids to their ability to cause selective neuronal lesions. Intracerebral injection of the neuroexcitatory tryptophan metabolite, quinolinic acid, has behavioral, neurochemical, and neuropathological consequences reminiscent of those of exogenous excitotoxins, such as kainic and ibotenic acids. Its qualities as a neurotoxic agent suggest that quinolinic acid should be considered as a possible pathogenic factor in neurodegenerative disorders.
In associative learning, the activated neurones undergo a variety of concomitant functional alterations--increases or decreases of firing activity and modifications of membrane potential or resistance and of synaptic responsiveness. Synaptic transmission which can be strengthened only when there is paired activity in two pathways is of particular interest in relation to mechanisms for associative learning. For the neocortex, there are few observations of the plastic changes, induced by conditioning procedures, in the effectiveness of individual synapses. We now report that various regimes with joint stimulations of convergent excitatory pathways on to intracellularly recorded neurones in the motor cortex of the cat result in synaptic facilitation lasting for up to 30 min.
It has been proposed that cell-cell recognition occurs by means of local cell surface modulation of a small number of proteins rather than by expression of large numbers of different cell surface markers. Several different cell adhesion molecules (CAM's) have now been found in a number of vertebrate species in different tissues such as liver and striated muscle and even in a single complex structure such as the brain, where different molecules specific for neurons and glia have been identified. The neuron-specific molecule is involved in early embryonic events but also mediates neurite fasciculation, neuromuscular interaction, and orderly layering of neural tissue. It undergoes local surface modulation with loss of sialic acid during development. A failure of this process is closely correlated with connectional disorders in the staggerer mutant of the mouse. The accumulated data on this and other CAM's favor modulation theories rather than strict chemoaffinity theories of cell-cell recognition.
Working memory represents the ability of the brain to hold externally or internally driven information for relatively short periods of time. Persistent neuronal activity is the elementary process underlying working memory but its cellular basis remains unknown. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that persistent activity is based on synaptic reverberations in recurrent circuits. The entorhinal cortex in the parahippocampal region is crucially involved in the acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of long-term memory traces for which working memory operations are essential. Here we show that individual neurons from layer V of the entorhinal cortex-which link the hippocampus to extensive cortical regions-respond to consecutive stimuli with graded changes in firing frequency that remain stable after each stimulus presentation. In addition, the sustained levels of firing frequency can be either increased or decreased in an input-specific manner. This firing behaviour displays robustness to distractors; it is linked to cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation, and relies on activity-dependent changes of a Ca2+-sensitive cationic current. Such an intrinsic neuronal ability to generate graded persistent activity constitutes an elementary mechanism for working memory.
Vanderhaeghen et al. reported the occurrence of gastrin-like immunoreactivity in the mammalian brain. Subsequent studies have revealed that this immunoreactivity corresponded mainly to the COOH-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8), which has a COOH-terminal pentapeptide identical to gastrin. Also, two peptides resembling the NH- and the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide fragments of CCK-8 are present in the central nervous system (CNS). Using COOH-terminal-specific antisera raised to gastrin and/or CCK, the distribution of CCK neurones has been described with immunohistochemical techniques. Although high numbers of cells and nerve terminals are found in cortical areas, the CCK systems are also present in most other parts of the brain and spinal cord. In the CNS, true gastrin molecules, gastrin-17 and gastrin-34 have been located only in the neurohypophysis, hypothalamus and occasionally in the medulla oblongata (unpublished results). We describe here the occurrence of peptides in meso-limbic dopamine neurones in the rat brain. Evidence has also been obtained that mesencephalic dopamine neurones in the human brain contain similar peptides.
How neuronal networks enable animals, humans included, to make coordinated movements is a continuing goal of neuroscience research. The stomatogastric nervous system of decapod crustaceans, which contains a set of distinct but interacting motor circuits, has contributed significantly to the general principles guiding our present understanding of how rhythmic motor circuits operate at the cellular level. This results from a detailed documentation of the circuit dynamics underlying motor pattern generation in this system as well as its modulation by individual transmitters and neurons.
Whether social comparison affects individual well-being is of central importance for understanding behavior in any social environment. Traditional economic theories focus on the role of absolute rewards, whereas behavioral evidence suggests that social comparisons influence well-being and decisions. We investigated the impact of social comparisons on reward-related brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While being scanned in two adjacent MRI scanners, pairs of subjects had to simultaneously perform a simple estimation task that entailed monetary rewards for correct answers. We show that a variation in the comparison subject's payment affects blood oxygenation level-dependent responses in the ventral striatum. Our results provide neurophysiological evidence for the importance of social comparison on reward processing in the human brain.
Ratios of discharge rates in desynchronized sleep to those in waking and synchronized sleep of gigantocellular neurons are five to ten times higher than are those of neurons in adjacent tegmental fields and 25 to 30 times higher than in other brain sites. This marked concentration of activity in desynchronized sleep is compatible with an active roie of gigantocellular neurons in the generation of this sleep phase.
Binding characteristics of tritiated imipramine were determined in the frontal cortex of suicides and well-matched controls. Maximal binding was significantly lower in brains from the suicides. This finding is consistent with reports of decreased tritiated imipramine binding in the platelets of patients diagnosed as having a major affective disorder.
The auditory cortex of the mustache bat, Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus, is composed of functional divisions which are differently organized to be suited for processing the elements of its biosonar signal according to their biological significance. Unlike the Doppler-shifted-CF (constant frequency) processing area, the area processing the frequency-modulated components does not show clear tonotopic and amplitopic representations, but consists of several clusters of neurons, each of which is sensitive to a particular combination (or combinations) of information-bearing elements of the biosonar signal and echoes. The response properties of neurons in the major clusters indicate that processing of information carried by the frequency-modulated components of echoes is facilitated by the first harmonic of the emitted biosonar signal. The properties of some of these neurons suggest that they are tuned to a target which has a particular cross-sectional area and which is located at a particular distance.
Neuronal activity patterns contain information in their temporal structure, indicating that information transfer between neurons may be optimized by temporal filtering. In the zebrafish olfactory bulb, subsets of output neurons (mitral cells) engage in synchronized oscillations during odour responses, but information about odour identity is contained mostly in non-oscillatory firing rate patterns. Using optogenetic manipulations and odour stimulation, we found that firing rate responses of neurons in the posterior zone of the dorsal telencephalon (Dp), a target area homologous to olfactory cortex, were largely insensitive to oscillatory synchrony of mitral cells because passive membrane properties and synaptic currents act as low-pass filters. Nevertheless, synchrony influenced spike timing. Moreover, Dp neurons responded primarily during the decorrelated steady state of mitral cell activity patterns. Temporal filtering therefore tunes Dp neurons to components of mitral cell activity patterns that are particularly informative about precise odour identity. These results demonstrate how temporal filtering can extract specific information from multiplexed neuronal codes.
Ovariectomized adult female canaries were treated with physiological doses of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or estradiol. Singing, which is typical of males, occurred in the testosterone-treated birds but not in any of the other birds. The effect of these hormones was assessed on dendrites from a class of neurons in the nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA), a forebrain nucleus for song control. The RA neurons of the testosterone-treated birds had dendritic trees resembling those of intact males. The RA neurons of the estradiol- and dihydrotesterone-treated birds resembled those of intact females. All hormone-treated groups had dendrites that were significantly longer than those of untreated ovariectomized females. Thus gonadal hormones induce dendritic growth in the adult avian brain.
It is known that pain perception can be altered by mood, attention and cognition, or by direct stimulation of the cerebral cortex, but we know little of the neural mechanisms underlying the cortical modulation of pain. One of the few cortical areas consistently activated by painful stimuli is the rostral agranular insular cortex (RAIC) where, as in other parts of the cortex, the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) robustly inhibits neuronal activity. Here we show that changes in GABA neurotransmission in the RAIC can raise or lower the pain threshold--producing analgesia or hyperalgesia, respectively--in freely moving rats. Locally increasing GABA, by using an enzyme inhibitor or gene transfer mediated by a viral vector, produces lasting analgesia by enhancing the descending inhibition of spinal nociceptive neurons. Selectively activating GABA(B)-receptor-bearing RAIC neurons produces hyperalgesia through projections to the amygdala, an area involved in pain and fear. Whereas most studies focus on the role of the cerebral cortex as the end point of nociceptive processing, we suggest that cerebral cortex activity can change the set-point of pain threshold in a top-down manner.
It is apparent that antibiotics are useful in differentiating different stages in the formation of memory. Puromycin gave the first indication that very early memory can be established and survive, for a short period at least, in spite of inhibition of protein synthesis (12). Injection of actinomycin D indicates that RNA synthesis is not essential during this early stage (13). The duration of this early period seems to vary with the inhibiting agent; with puromycin memory was notably degraded in less than an hour, but with actinomycin D or with acetoxycycloheximide it persisted for several hours or more. The fixation or consolidation of memory involves whatever processes give permanence to memory. These processes are disrupted when electroconvulsive shock is administered shortly after a learning experience, presumably because of the interference with organized patterns of neuronal electrical activity. Memory acquired in the presence of antibiotics appears to proceed to a stage beyond that based purely on electrical activity because the memory persists beyond the period usually reported as sensitive to electroconvulsive shock. Further work should show whether this stage is truly insensitive to electroconvulsive shock. Memory acquired in the presence of puromycin does not seem to achieve any durable consolidation. In contrast, memory acquired in the presence of or immediately before injection of acetoxycycloheximide does appear to initiate the later stages of consolidation, as permanent memory. reappears some days after the initial stages have become ineffective in controlling performance. Finally, puromycin has provided evidence of the enlarged area of the neocortex which participates as memory matures. Puromycin also indicates the time required for this maturation process. Since antibiotics have also been useful in studying learning and memory in goldfish (14), this approach seems to have general applicability in defining various stages in the process of memory formation. The initial purpose of these investigations was to determine the molecular basis of the "memory trace" This goal still remains distant, although there are some indications that protein synthesizing systems are involved. This objective, though of enormous interest, is to be regarded as only a necessary first step. Whether new proteins or some other molecules cause the changes in synapses thought to underlie memory, this knowledge of itself will contribute only a beginning to our understanding of the events which account for the functioning of the brain. A determination of the composition of computer components would provide very little information towards unraveling their function. As the experiments proceeded, however, information of a more general nature was being obtained. The identification of different stages of consolidation show how injections of antibiotics can supplement electroconvulsive shock as a way of disrupting the establishment of memory and how it can supplement ablation in destroying memory already laid down in a permanent mode. Applied to larger animals the localization of various regions sensitive or insensitive to the action of the drugs should become more definitive. We hope that such experiments will contribute increasingly to the general problem of brain function.
Synaptic contacts per unit area in the rat dentate gyrus reach adult numbers by the end of the first month after birth and remain constant thereafter. This experiment demonstrated that the rate at which synapses were replaced by sprouting after a lesion declined dramatically from 35 to 90 days of age. Thus, the juvenile period of the rat's life is marked by a considerable change in neuronal plasticity. This may be related to age-dependent effects in recovery from brain damage.
A major challenge in neuroscience is to decipher the structural layout of the brain. The term "connectome" has recently been proposed to refer to the highly organized connection matrix of the human brain. However, defining how information flows through such a complex system represents so difficult a task that it seems unlikely it could be achieved in the near future or, for the most pessimistic, perhaps ever. Circuit diagrams of the nervous system can be considered at different levels, although they are surely impossible to complete at the synaptic level. Nevertheless, advances in our capacity to marry macro- and microscopic data may help establish a realistic statistical model that could describe connectivity at the ultrastructural level, the "synaptome," giving us cause for optimism.
In the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS), a cascade of signals that originates in the ectoderm adjacent to the neural tube is propagated by the roof plate to dorsalize the neural tube. Here we report that the phenotype of the spontaneous neurological mutant mouse dreher (dr) results from a failure of the roof plate to develop. Dorsalization of the neural tube is consequently affected: dorsal interneurons in the spinal cord and granule neurons in the cerebellar cortex are lost, and the dorsal vertebral neural arches fail to form. Positional cloning of dreher indicates that the LIM homeodomain protein, Lmx1a, is affected in three different alleles of dreher. Lmx1a is expressed in the roof plate along the neuraxis during development of the CNS. Thus, Lmx1a is required for development of the roof plate and, in turn, for specification of dorsal cell fates in the CNS and developing vertebrae.
The ability to shift between different behavioral strategies is necessary for appropriate decision-making. Here, we show that chronic stress biases decision-making strategies, affecting the ability of stressed animals to perform actions on the basis of their consequences. Using two different operant tasks, we revealed that, in making choices, rats subjected to chronic stress became insensitive to changes in outcome value and resistant to changes in action-outcome contingency. Furthermore, chronic stress caused opposing structural changes in the associative and sensorimotor corticostriatal circuits underlying these different behavioral strategies, with atrophy of medial prefrontal cortex and the associative striatum and hypertrophy of the sensorimotor striatum. These data suggest that the relative advantage of circuits coursing through sensorimotor striatum observed after chronic stress leads to a bias in behavioral strategies toward habit.
Studies of the visual capacity of neurological patients have provided evidence for a dissociation between the perceptual report of a visual stimulus and the ability to direct spatially accurate movements toward that stimulus. Some patients with damage to the parietal lobe, for example, are unable to reach accurately towards visual targets that they unequivocally report seeing. Conversely, some patients with extensive damage to primary visual cortex can make accurate pointing movements or saccades toward a stimulus presented in their 'blind' scotoma. But in investigations of visuomotor control in patients with visual disorders, little consideration has been given to complex acts such as manual prehension. Grasping a three-dimensional object requires knowledge not only of the object's spatial location, but also of its form, orientation and size. We have examined a patient with a profound disorder in the perception of such object qualities. Our quantitative analyses demonstrate strikingly accurate guidance of hand and finger movements directed at the very objects whose qualities she fails to perceive. These data suggest that the neural substrates for the visual perception of object qualities such as shape, orientation and size are distinct from those underlying the use of those qualities in the control of manual skills.
To achieve a volitional goal, we need to execute multiple movements in a specific temporal order. After repetitive performance of a particular sequence of movements, we are able to memorize and execute the whole sequence without external guidance. Where and how in the brain do we store information necessary for the orderly performance of multiple movements? We have found a group of cells in the cerebral cortex of monkeys whose activity is exclusively related to a sequence of multiple movements performed in a particular order. Such cellular activity exists in the supplementary motor area, but not in the primary motor cortex. We propose that these cells contribute a signal about the order of forthcoming multiple movements, and are useful for planning and coding of several movements ahead.
In the report "Birth of projection neurons in adult avian brain may be related to perceptual or motor learning" by Arturo Alvarez-Buylla et al. (21 Sept., p. 1444), parts B and C in figure 1 were transposed. The legend is correct.
Intracellular recordings were obtained in the vitro slice preparation from neurons of lateral and mesial temporal cortex removed from human epileptics suffering from intractable temporal lobe seizures. Spontaneous rhythmic synaptic events, which were capable of triggering action potential discharge, were observed in many neurons, particularly in mesial tissue slices. Such activity may reflect the epileptogenic capacity of this human cortex.
In primates, sensory input can generate reflex motor cortex output in association with learned movement when the sensory input has a strong and direct connection to the motor cortex-for example, when a stimulus calling for repositioning of the hand consists of a perturbation of hand position. This finding supports the proposal that neurons of primate motor cortex may function in a transcortical servo-loop.
Barn owls not only localize auditory stimuli with great accuracy, they also remember the locations of auditory stimuli and can use this remembered spatial information to guide their flight and strike. Although the mechanisms of sound localization have been studied extensively, the neurobiological basis of auditory spatial memory has not. Here we show that the ability of barn owls to orient their gaze towards and fly to the remembered location of auditory targets is lost during pharmacological inactivation of a small region in the forebrain, the anterior archistriatum. In contrast, archistriatal inactivation has no effect on stimulus-guided responses to auditory targets. The memory-dependent deficit is evident only for acoustic events that occur in the hemifield contralateral to the side that is inactivated. The data demonstrate that in the avian archistriatum, as in the mammalian frontal cortex, there exists a region that is essential for the expression of spatial working memory and that, in the barn owl, this region encodes auditory spatial memory.
Protein I is one of the best candidates for a neuronal protein whose phosphorylation may have a functional role in synaptic activity. It is a substrate for both cyclic AMP-dependent and protein kinases, and these kinases show differential specificity for its multiple phosphorylation sites. Protein I is found exclusively in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and immunohistochemical and subcellular fractionation studies suggest an association primarily with synaptic vesicles. Using slices of rat cerebral cortex incubated in vitro, Protein I was phosphorylated both by agents which increase intracellular cyclic AMP and by agents causing Ca2+ influx, although not by any putative neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. We have now examined the facial motor nucleus and report here that serotonin produces a phosphorylation of Protein I when incubated with facial nucleus slices. Demonstration of a neurotransmitter-dependent alteration in the state of phosphorylation of a synapse-specific protein may be due to the relatively simple neuronal circuitry within the facial motor nucleus.
During learning, neural responses decrease over repeated exposure to identical stimuli. This repetition suppression is thought to reflect a progressive optimization of neuronal responses elicited by the task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study the neural basis of associative learning of visual objects and their locations. As expected, activation in specialized cortical areas decreased with time. However, with path analysis it was shown that, in parallel to this adaptation, increases in effective connectivity occurred between distinct cortical systems specialized for spatial and object processing. The time course of these plastic changes was highly correlated with individual learning performance, suggesting that interactions between brain areas underlie associative learning.
Attention helps us process potentially important objects by selectively increasing the activity of sensory neurons that represent the relevant locations and features of our environment. This selection process requires top-down feedback about what is important in our environment. We investigated how parietal cortical output influences neural activity in early sensory areas. Neural recordings were made simultaneously from the posterior parietal cortex and an earlier area in the visual pathway, the medial temporal area, of macaques performing a visual matching task. When the monkey selectively attended to a location, the timing of activities in the two regions became synchronized, with the parietal cortex leading the medial temporal area. Parietal neurons may thus selectively increase activity in earlier sensory areas to enable focused spatial attention.
Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD; E.C. 4.1.1.15) converts glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system. This report describes the isolation of a GAD complementary DNA clone by immunological screening of a lambda gt-11 brain complementary DNA expression library. The fusion protein produced by this clone catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to GABA and carbon dioxide, confirming its identity as GAD. Antibodies to beta-galactosidase remove GAD enzymatic activity from solution, showing that this activity is associated with the fusion protein. In immunoblotting experiments all three available antisera to GAD reacted with the fusion polypeptide and with two major polypeptides (molecular size, 60,000 and 66,000 daltons) in brain extracts.
The neural mechanisms supporting the ability to recognize and respond to fictive outcomes, outcomes of actions that one has not taken, remain obscure. We hypothesized that neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which monitors the consequences of actions and mediates subsequent changes in behavior, would respond to fictive reward information. We recorded responses of single neurons during performance of a choice task that provided information about the reward values of options that were not chosen. We found that ACC neurons signal fictive reward information and use a coding scheme similar to that used to signal experienced outcomes. Thus, individual ACC neurons process both experienced and fictive rewards.
Recent observation of objects speeds up their subsequent identification and classification. This common form of learning, known as repetition priming, can operate in the absence of explicit memory for earlier experiences, and functional neuroimaging has shown that object classification improved in this way is accompanied by 'neural priming' (reduced neural activity) in prefrontal, fusiform and other cortical regions. These observations have led to suggestions that cortical representations of items undergo 'tuning', whereby neurons encoding irrelevant information respond less as a given object is observed repeatedly, thereby facilitating future availability of pertinent object knowledge. Here we provide experimental support for an alternative hypothesis, in which reduced cortical activity occurs because subjects rapidly learn their previous responses. After a primed object classification (such as 'bigger than a shoebox'), cue reversal ('smaller than a shoebox') greatly slowed performance and completely eliminated neural priming in fusiform cortex, which suggests that these cortical item representations were no more available for primed objects than they were for new objects. In contrast, prefrontal cortex activity tracked behavioural priming and predicted the degree to which cue reversal would slow down object classification--highlighting the role of the prefrontal cortex in executive control.
Clinical, genetic, and neuropsychopharmacological studies of developmental factors in alcoholism are providing a better understanding of the neurobiological bases of personality and learning. Studies of the adopted-away children of alcoholics show that the predisposition to initiate alcohol-seeking behavior is genetically different from susceptibility to loss of control after drinking begins. Alcohol-seeking behavior is a special case of exploratory appetitive behavior and involves different neurogenetic processes than do susceptibility to behavioral tolerance and dependence on the antianxiety or sedative effects of alcohol. Three dimensions of personality have been described that may reflect individual differences in brain systems modulating the activation, maintenance, and inhibition of behavioral responses to the effects of alcohol and other environmental stimuli. These personality traits distinguish alcoholics with different patterns of behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuropharmacological responses to alcohol.
Although memory allocation is a subject of active research in computer science, little is known about how the brain allocates information within neural circuits. There is an extensive literature on how specific types of memory engage different parts of the brain, and how neurons in these regions process and store information. Until recently, however, the mechanisms that determine how specific cells and synapses within a neural circuit (and not their neighbors) are recruited during learning have received little attention. Recent findings suggest that memory allocation is not random, but rather specific mechanisms regulate where information is stored within a neural circuit. New methods that allow tagging, imaging, activation, and inactivation of neurons in behaving animals promise to revolutionize studies of brain circuits, including memory allocation. Results from these studies are likely to have a considerable impact on computer science, as well as on the understanding of memory and its disorders.
To extract important information from the environment on a useful timescale, the visual system must be able to adapt rapidly to constantly changing scenes. This requires dynamic control of visual resolution, possibly at the level of the responses of single neurons. Individual cells in the visual cortex respond to light stimuli on particular locations (receptive fields) on the retina, and the structure of these receptive fields can change in different contexts. Here we show experimentally that the shape of receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of anaesthetized cats undergoes significant modifications, which are correlated with the general state of the brain as assessed by electroencephalography: receptive fields are wider during synchronized states and smaller during non-synchronized states. We also show that cortical receptive fields shrink over time when stimulated with flashing light spots. Finally, by using a network model we account for the changing size of the cortical receptive fields by dynamically rescaling the levels of excitation and inhibition in the visual thalamus and cortex. The observed dynamic changes in the sizes of the cortical receptive field could be a reflection of a process that adapts the spatial resolution within the primary visual pathway to different states of excitability.
Bilateral stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle with pulses of varying interpulse intervals elicited a pattern of self-stimulation behavior in the rat indicative of temporal synaptic summation: the shorter the interval the greater the response. In contrast, the effectiveness of unilateral stimulation at very short intervals was limited by neuronal refractory periods. The results support the notion that there is convergence of the medial forebrain bundle self-stimulation system from the two sides of the brain and suggest ways of studying the degree of convergence. They also suggest a technique for behaviorally comparing heterosynaptic and homosynaptic mechanisms of summation.
The rostral hypothalamus and adjacent basal forebrain participate in the generation of sleep, but the neuronal circuitry involved in this process remains poorly characterized. Immunocytochemistry was used to identify the FOS protein, an immediate-early gene product, in a group of ventrolateral preoptic neurons that is specifically activated during sleep. The retrograde tracer cholera toxin B, in combination with FOS immunocytochemistry, was used to show that sleep-activated ventrolateral preoptic neurons innervate the tuberomammillary nucleus, a posterior hypothalamic cell group thought to participate in the modulation of arousal. This monosynaptic pathway in the hypothalamus may play a key role in determining sleep-wake states.
Understanding how the brain constructs movements remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. The brain may control complex movements through flexible combination of motor primitives, where each primitive is an element of computation in the sensorimotor map that transforms desired limb trajectories into motor commands. Theoretical studies have shown that a system's ability to learn action depends on the shape of its primitives. Using a time-series analysis of error patterns, here we show that humans learn the dynamics of reaching movements through a flexible combination of primitives that have gaussian-like tuning functions encoding hand velocity. The wide tuning of the inferred primitives predicts limitations on the brain's ability to represent viscous dynamics. We find close agreement between the predicted limitations and the subjects' adaptation to new force fields. The mathematical properties of the derived primitives resemble the tuning curves of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The activity of these cells may encode primitives that underlie the learning of dynamics.
Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity is observed at many synapses and may underlie behavioural adaptations in addiction. Mechanistic investigations start with the identification of the molecular drug targets. Cocaine, for example, exerts its reinforcing and early neuroadaptive effects by inhibiting the dopamine transporter, thus causing a strong increase in mesolimbic dopamine. Among the many signalling pathways subsequently engaged, phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the nucleus accumbens is of particular interest because it has been implicated in NMDA-receptor and type 1 dopamine (D1)-receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation as well as in several behavioural adaptations. A causal link between drug-evoked plasticity at identified synapses and behavioural adaptations, however, is missing, and the benefits of restoring baseline transmission have yet to be demonstrated. Here we find that cocaine potentiates excitatory transmission in D1-receptor-expressing medium-sized spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs) in mice via ERK signalling with a time course that parallels locomotor sensitization. Depotentiation of cortical nucleus accumbens inputs by optogenetic stimulation in vivo efficiently restored normal transmission and abolished cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. These findings establish synaptic potentiation selectively in D1R-MSNs as a mechanism underlying a core component of addiction, probably by creating an imbalance between distinct populations of MSNs in the nucleus accumbens. Our data also provide proof of principle that reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity can treat behavioural alterations caused by addictive drugs and may inspire novel therapeutic approaches involving deep brain stimulation or transcranial magnetic stimulation.
Slowly but surely, Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients lose their memory and their cognitive abilities, and even their personalities may change dramatically. These changes are due to the progressive dysfunction and death of nerve cells that are responsible for the storage and processing of information. Although drugs can temporarily improve memory, at present there are no treatments that can stop or reverse the inexorable neurodegenerative process. But rapid progress towards understanding the cellular and molecular alterations that are responsible for the neuron's demise may soon help in developing effective preventative and therapeutic strategies.
The lateral hypothalamus is a brain region historically implicated in reward and motivation, but the identity of the neurotransmitters involved are unknown. The orexins (or hypocretins) are neuropeptides recently identified as neurotransmitters in lateral hypothalamus neurons. Although knockout and transgenic overexpression studies have implicated orexin neurons in arousal and sleep, these cells also project to reward-associated brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. This indicates a possible role for these neurons in reward function and motivation, consistent with previous studies implicating these neurons in feeding. Here we show that activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons is strongly linked to preferences for cues associated with drug and food reward. In addition, we show that chemical activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons reinstates an extinguished drug-seeking behaviour. This reinstatement effect was completely blocked by prior administration of an orexin A antagonist. Moreover, administration of the orexin A peptide directly into the ventral tegmental area also reinstated drug-seeking. These data reveal a new role for lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons in reward-seeking, drug relapse and addiction.
Various brain imaging techniques have become available in the past decade. These include techniques to evaluate brain structure, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and techniques to assess functional activity, such as measurement of regional cerebral blood flow, single photon emission computed tomography, and positron emission tomography. These techniques can be used to map brain structure and function in normal human beings, and they have enlarged our knowledge of the pathophysiology of mental illnesses by demonstrating structural, metabolic, and neurochemical abnormalities in a wide range of mental disorders.
A sudden touch on one hand can improve vision near that hand, revealing crossmodal links in spatial attention. It is often assumed that such links involve only multimodal neural structures, but unimodal brain areas may also be affected. We tested the effect of simultaneous visuo-tactile stimulation on the activity of the human visual cortex. Tactile stimulation enhanced activity in the visual cortex, but only when it was on the same side as a visual target. Analysis of effective connectivity between brain areas suggests that touch influences unimodal visual cortex via back-projections from multimodal parietal areas. This provides a neural explanation for crossmodal links in spatial attention.
We argue that an understanding of the faculty of language requires substantial interdisciplinary cooperation. We suggest how current developments in linguistics can be profitably wedded to work in evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience. We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB) and in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).
The size of the midsagittal area of the human corpus callosum obtained from postmortem measurement varied with tested hand preference. The corpus callosum, the main fiber tract connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, was larger by about 0.75 square centimeter, or 11 percent, in left-handed and ambidextrous people than in those with consistent right-hand preference. The difference was present in both the anterior and posterior halves, but not in the region of the splenium itself. This callosal morphology, which varied with hand preference, may also be related to individual differences in the pattern of hemispheric functional specialization. The greater bihemispheric representation of cognitive functions in left- and mixed-handers may be associated with greater anatomical connection between the hemispheres. The naturally occurring regressive events in neurogenesis, such as neuronal cell death and axonal elimination, may be factors in the individual differences in brain morphology and in functional lateralization. Specifically, right-handers may be those with more extensive early elimination of neural components.
Cannabinoid receptors are molecular targets for marijuana and hashish, the widespread drugs of abuse. These receptors are expressed in areas of the central nervous system that contribute in important ways to the control of memory, cognition, movement and pain perception. Indeed, such functions can be strongly influenced by cannabinoid drugs, with consequences that include euphoria, analgesia, sedation and memory impairment. Although the pharmacology of cannabinoid drugs is now beginning to be understood, we still lack essential information on the endogenous signalling system(s) by which cannabinoid receptors are normally engaged. An endogenous ligand for cannabinoid receptors, anandamide, has been described. Here we report that sn-2 arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), a cannabinoid ligand isolated from intestinal tissue, is present in brain in amounts 170 times greater than anandamide. 2-AG is produced in hippocampal slices by stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals, an excitatory fibre tract that projects from CA3 to CA1 neurons. Formation of 2-AG is calcium dependent and is mediated by the enzymes phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase. 2-AG activates neuronal cannabinoid receptors as a full agonist, and prevents the induction of long-term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses. Our results indicate that 2-AG is a second endogenous cannabinoid ligand in the central nervous system.
Neurons in the mammalian neocortex are organized into functional columns. Within a column, highly specific synaptic connections are formed to ensure that similar physiological properties are shared by neuron ensembles spanning from the pia to the white matter. Recent studies indicate that synaptic connectivity in the neocortex is sparse and highly specific to allow even adjacent neurons to convey information independently. How this fine-scale microcircuit is constructed to create a functional columnar architecture at the level of individual neurons largely remains a mystery. Here we investigate whether radial clones of excitatory neurons arising from the same mother cell in the developing neocortex serve as a substrate for the formation of this highly specific microcircuit. We labelled ontogenetic radial clones of excitatory neurons in the mouse neocortex by in utero intraventricular injection of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing retroviruses around the onset of the peak phase of neocortical neurogenesis. Multiple-electrode whole-cell recordings were performed to probe synapse formation among these EGFP-labelled sister excitatory neurons in radial clones and the adjacent non-siblings during postnatal stages. We found that radially aligned sister excitatory neurons have a propensity for developing unidirectional chemical synapses with each other rather than with neighbouring non-siblings. Moreover, these synaptic connections display the same interlaminar directional preference as those observed in the mature neocortex. These results indicate that specific microcircuits develop preferentially within ontogenetic radial clones of excitatory neurons in the developing neocortex and contribute to the emergence of functional columnar microarchitectures in the mature neocortex.
Reading is essential in modern societies, but many children have dyslexia, a difficulty in learning to read. Dyslexia often arises from impaired phonological awareness, the auditory analysis of spoken language that relates the sounds of language to print. Behavioral remediation, especially at a young age, is effective for many, but not all, children. Neuroimaging in children with dyslexia has revealed reduced engagement of the left temporo-parietal cortex for phonological processing of print, altered white-matter connectivity, and functional plasticity associated with effective intervention. Behavioral and brain measures identify infants and young children at risk for dyslexia, and preventive intervention is often effective. A combination of evidence-based teaching practices and cognitive neuroscience measures could prevent dyslexia from occurring in the majority of children who would otherwise develop dyslexia.
It is well known that neural activity exhibits variability, in the sense that identical sensory stimuli produce different responses, but it has been difficult to determine what this variability means. Is it noise, or does it carry important information-about, for example, the internal state of the organism? Here we address this issue from the bottom up, by asking whether small perturbations to activity in cortical networks are amplified. Based on in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat barrel cortex, we find that a perturbation consisting of a single extra spike in one neuron produces approximately 28 additional spikes in its postsynaptic targets. We also show, using simultaneous intra- and extracellular recordings, that a single spike in a neuron produces a detectable increase in firing rate in the local network. Theoretical analysis indicates that this amplification leads to intrinsic, stimulus-independent variations in membrane potential of the order of +/-2.2-4.5 mV-variations that are pure noise, and so carry no information at all. Therefore, for the brain to perform reliable computations, it must either use a rate code, or generate very large, fast depolarizing events, such as those proposed by the theory of synfire chains. However, in our in vivo recordings, we found that such events were very rare. Our findings are thus consistent with the idea that cortex is likely to use primarily a rate code.
Synapses develop concurrently and at identical rates in different layers of the visual, somatosensory, motor, and prefrontal areas of the primate cerebral cortex. This isochronic course of synaptogenesis in anatomically and functionally diverse regions indicates that the entire cerebral cortex develops as a whole and that the establishment of cell-to-cell communication in this structure may be orchestrated by a single genetic or humoral signal. This is in contrast to the traditional view of hierarchical development of the cortical regions and provides new insight into the maturation of cortical functions.
Unexplained debilitating dementia or encephalopathy occurs frequently in adults and children with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Brains from 15 individuals with AIDS and encephalopathy were examined by Southern analysis and in situ hybridization for the presence of human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type III (HTLV-III), the virus believed to be the causative agent of AIDS. HTLV-III DNA was detected in the brains of five patients, and viral-specific RNA was detected in four of these. In view of these findings and the recent demonstration of morphologic and genetic relatedness between HTLV-III and visna virus, a lentivirus that causes a chronic degenerative neurologic disease in sheep, HTLV-III should be evaluated further as a possible cause of AIDS encephalopathy.
A fundamental step in visual pattern recognition is the establishment of relations between spatially separate features. Recently, we have shown that neurons in the cat visual cortex have oscillatory responses in the range 40-60 Hz (refs 1, 2) which occur in synchrony for cells in a functional column and are tightly correlated with a local oscillatory field potential. This led us to hypothesize that the synchronization of oscillatory responses of spatially distributed, feature selective cells might be a way to establish relations between features in different parts of the visual field. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that neurons in spatially separate columns can synchronize their oscillatory responses. The synchronization has, on average, no phase difference, depends on the spatial separation and the orientation preference of the cells and is influenced by global stimulus properties.
Neuroectoderm cells in the cortical ventricular zone generate many diverse cell types, maintain the ventricular zone during embryonic life and create another germinal layer, the subventricular zone, which persists into adulthood. In other vertebrate tissues, including skin, intestine, blood and neural crest, stem cells are important in maintaining a germinal population and generating differentiated progeny. By following the fates of single ventricular zone cells in culture, we show here that self-renewing, multipotential stem cells are present in the embryonic rat cerebral cortex. Forty per cent of these stem cells produced all three principal cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Stem cells constituted about 7% of cortical clones; in contrast, over 80% consisted of small numbers of neurons or glia. We suggest that multipotential stem cells may be the ancestors of other cortical progenitor cells that exhibit more limited proliferation and more restricted repertoires of progeny fates.
The gene, encoding the A4 peptide found in the amyloid core of senile plaques isolated from the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease, produces at least three precursors that resemble cell surface receptors. A clone isolated from a human brain complementary DNA library contained the structural sequence for an A4 amyloid peptide precursor with a serine protease inhibitor domain in which 208 amino acids at the carboxyl terminal are replaced by 20 amino acids derived from nucleotide sequences with homology to the Alu repeat family. This protein devoid of the transmembrane domain most likely represents a secreted form of the A4 amyloid peptide precursor.
The cochlear implant, a microelectrode array that directly stimulates the auditory nerve, has greatly benefited many individuals with profound deafness. Deaf patients without an intact auditory nerve may be helped by the next generation of auditory prostheses: surface or penetrating auditory brainstem implants that bypass the auditory nerve and directly stimulate auditory processing centers in the brainstem.
Hebb's rule (1949) states that learning and memory are based on modifications of synaptic strength among neurons that are simultaneously active. This implies that enhanced synaptic coincidence detection would lead to better learning and memory. If the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, a synaptic coincidence detector, acts as a graded switch for memory formation, enhanced signal detection by NMDA receptors should enhance learning and memory. Here we show that overexpression of NMDA receptor 2B (NR2B) in the forebrains of transgenic mice leads to enhanced activation of NMDA receptors, facilitating synaptic potentiation in response to stimulation at 10-100 Hz. These mice exhibit superior ability in learning and memory in various behavioural tasks, showing that NR2B is critical in gating the age-dependent threshold for plasticity and memory formation. NMDA-receptor-dependent modifications of synaptic efficacy, therefore, represent a unifying mechanism for associative learning and memory. Our results suggest that genetic enhancement of mental and cognitive attributes such as intelligence and memory in mammals is feasible.
Drosophila neuroblasts and epithelial cells in the procephalic neurogenic region divide perpendicular to the surface, and segregate the proteins Numb and Prospero into the basal daughter cell. We demonstrate here that orientation of the mitotic spindle and correct localization of Numb and Prospero in these cells require the inscuteable gene. Moreover, ectopic expression of inscuteable in other epithelial cells leads to spindle reorientation. The Inscuteable protein localizes to the apical cell cortex before mitosis, suggesting that Inscuteable functions in establishing polarity for asymmetric cell division.
Glycine increases Cl- conductance in neurones of the lamprey central nervous system and mimics the natural inhibitory transmitter pharmacologically. We have use current noise produce by glycine to examine in more detail the characteristics of inhibitory channels in Muller cells in the brain stem reticular formation. The channels have large conductances and mean open times consistent with large amplitudes and long durations of spontaneously occurring inhibitory synaptic currents. We now show that, unlike any post-junctional channels reported so far, their conductance decreases rapidly with increasing intracellular concentration of the permeant ion. This surprising behaviour is inconsistent with constant field theory and also with a single-site pore model such as proposed for cationic channels at the motor endplate, both of which predict an increase in conductance with concentration. In addition, the decrease in conductance cannot be explained quantitatively by a two-site, single-file pore model such as proposed for K+ channels and Na+ channels in nerve and for gramicidin channels. This property of the inhibitory channel may be functionally important in preventing intracellular Cl- accumulation during periods of intense synaptic activity when inhibition might otherwise convert progressively to excitation as the Cl- equilibrium potential became more and more positive.
Neurons are thought to use diverse families of cell-surface molecules for cell recognition during circuit assembly. In Drosophila, alternative splicing of the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene potentially generates 38,016 closely related transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily, each comprising one of 19,008 alternative ectodomains linked to one of two alternative transmembrane segments. These ectodomains show isoform-specific homophilic binding, leading to speculation that Dscam proteins mediate cell recognition. Genetic studies have established that Dscam is required for neural circuit assembly, but the extent to which isoform diversity contributes to this process is not known. Here we provide conclusive evidence that Dscam diversity is essential for circuit assembly. Using homologous recombination, we reduced the entire repertoire of Dscam ectodomains to just a single isoform. Neural circuits in these mutants are severely disorganized. Furthermore, we show that it is crucial for neighbouring neurons to express distinct isoforms, but that the specific identity of the isoforms expressed in an individual neuron is unimportant. We conclude that Dscam diversity provides each neuron with a unique identity by which it can distinguish its own processes from those of other neurons, and that this self-recognition is essential for wiring the Drosophila brain.
Advances in the neurosciences have revealed the staggering complexity of even "simple" nervous systems. This is reflected in their function, their evolutionary history, their structure, and the coding schemes they use to represent information. These four viewpoints need all play a role in any future science of "brain complexity."
Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction requires an integration of basic neuroscience with social psychology, experimental psychology, and psychiatry. Addiction is presented as a cycle of spiralling dysregulation of brain reward systems that progressively increases, resulting in compulsive drug use and a loss of control over drug-taking. Sensitization and counteradaptation are hypothesized to contribute to this hedonic homeostatic dysregulation, and the neurobiological mechanisms involved, such as the mesolimbic dopamine system, opioid peptidergic systems, and brain and hormonal stress systems, are beginning to be characterized. This framework provides a realistic approach to identifying the neurobiological factors that produce vulnerability to addiction and to relapse in individuals with a history of addiction.
Immature rat brain tissue grafted to the brain of other immature and adult rats can survive and establish nerve connections with the host brains. In addition to facilitating the study of factors involved in the formation of central neural connections, brain grafts may also be used to substitute damaged or maldeveloped neurones. With exceptions in the visual system, the restoration of specific central neural connections has to date involved grafts of cholinergic and monoaminergic neurones, which have good regenerative capacity. In the present study, rat hippocampal neurones were damaged by neonatal X-ray irradiation and replaced by transplantation of normal, developing neurones of the same type. The grafted neurones (dentate granule cells) are not cholinergic or monoaminergic, but when appropriately located in the host hippocampal region they established specific and highly ordered afferent and efferent connections with the damaged host brain. Moreover, simultaneous demonstration of afferent and efferent transplant pathways showed that serial host-transplant-host connections had formed, restoring the normal neuronal circuitry initially disrupted by the irradiation.
Differential actions of acetylcholine on the excitability of two subtypes of interneurons in layer V of the rat visual cortex were examined. Acetylcholine excited low-threshold spike (LTS) cells through nicotinic receptors, whereas it elicited hyperpolarization in fast spiking (FS) cells through muscarinic receptors. Axons of LTS cells were mainly distributed vertically to upper layers, and those of FS cells were primarily confined to layer V. Thus, cortical cholinergic activation may reduce some forms of intralaminar inhibition, promote intracolumnar inhibition, and change the direction of information flow within cortical circuits.
Twenty-four hours after unilateral injection of cholera enterotoxin into the rat substantia nigra there is an increase, in the striatum on the injected side, of basal adenylate cyclase activity, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. Moreover, there is an increase of motor activity, and rats tend to circle contralateral to the side of the injection. Injection of cholera enterotoxin into brain nuclei may be a useful procedure for pharmacologically activating selected neuronal systems of brain and for studying the pharmacology of drugs that are suspected of interacting with these systems.
Although neurons in primary visual cortex are sensitive to the spatial distribution and intensity of light, their responses have not been thought to correlate with the perception of brightness. Indeed, primary visual cortex is often described as an initial processing stage that sends information to higher cortical areas where perception of brightness, color, and form occurs. However, a significant percentage of neurons in primary visual cortex were shown to respond in a manner correlated with perceived brightness, rather than responding strictly to the light level in the receptive fields of the cells. This finding suggests that even at the first stage of visual cortical processing, spatial integration of information yields perceptual qualities that are only indirectly related to the pattern of illumination of the retina.
Silicone pellets containing d-amphetamine base were implanted subcutaneously in rats. These pellets release amphetamine continuously for at least 10 days. Several days after implantation, swollen dopamine axons concomitant with large decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase activity were observed in the caudate nucleus. Decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activity was still present 110 days after pellet removal in the caudate but not in several other brain regions, nor in the caudate of rats injected with an equivalent amount of amphetamine in daily injections. This implies that continuous amphetamine administration has a selective neurotoxic effect on dopamine terminals in the caudate.
Neurons in area 17 of cat visual cortex display oscillatory responses that can synchronize across spatially separate columns in a stimulus-specific way. Response synchronization has now been shown to occur also between neurons in area 17 of the right and left cerebral hemispheres. This synchronization was abolished by section of the corpus callosum. Thus, the response synchronization is mediated by corticocortical connections. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that temporal synchrony of neuronal discharges serves to bind features within and between the visual hemifields.
Tanning in the newly emerged fly is induced by a hormone secreted by neurosecretory cells situated in the pars intercerebralis of the brain. The same hormone is contained in the compound ganglion of the thorax, in concentrations six times as high as in the brain. This hormone is believed to act directly on the eflector organ, and not through the secretion of ecdyson or a corpus allatum hormone; its release is effected through nervous impulses reaching the brain by way of the ventral nervous system a few minutes after the fly has emerged from the puparium. The hormone appears to be different from both the prothoraco-tropic and the gonadotropic hormones.
Sensory systems can adapt to the conditions imposed on them. In the visual system, adapting to a pattern increases the threshold of the ability to see that pattern, and reduces the perceived contrast of the pattern above threshold. Most neurons of the striate cortex reduce their responsiveness after being stimulated for some time by a high-contrast pattern. Such an effect may lie behind these psychophysical adaptation phenomena. These adaptation effects have been reported to be confined to patterns of similar orientation, which is understandable in that the visual neurons that adapt are only excited by a small range of orientations. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that neurons with different orientation preferences have inhibitory interconnections. It is therefore of interest to explore the possible effects of these connections on perception. Here we show that adapting to a horizontal pattern can reduce the perceived contrast of a vertical test pattern more than a horizontal test pattern. These 'cross-orientation' effects are modelled by a division-like process, whereas the more normal 'similar-orientation' effects are modelled by a subtractive process.
The neocortex receives information about the environment and the rest of the brain through pathways from the thalamus. These pathways have frequency-dependent properties that can strongly influence their effect on the neocortex. In 1943 Morison and Dempsey described "augmenting responses," a form of short-term plasticity in some thalamocortical pathways that is triggered by 8- to 15-hertz activation. Results from anesthetized rats showed that the augmenting response is initiated by pyramidal cells in layer V. The augmenting response was also observed in awake, unrestrained animals and was found to be dynamically modulated by their behavioral state.
The ability to acquire and use several languages selectively is a unique and essential human capacity. Here we investigate the fundamental question of how multiple languages are represented in a human brain. We applied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the spatial relationship between native and second languages in the human cortex, and show that within the frontal-lobe language-sensitive regions (Broca's area), second languages acquired in adulthood ('late' bilingual subjects) are spatially separated from native languages. However, when acquired during the early language acquisition stage of development ('early' bilingual subjects), native and second languages tend to be represented in common frontal cortical areas. In both late and early bilingual subjects, the temporal-lobe language-sensitive regions (Wernicke's area) also show effectively little or no separation of activity based on the age of language acquisition. This discovery of language-specific regions in Broca's area advances our understanding of the cortical representation that underlies multiple language functions.
The cystic fibrosis gene encodes a cyclic AMP-gated chloride channel (CFTR) that mediates electrolyte transport across the luminal surfaces of a variety of epithelial cells. The molecular mechanisms that modulate CFTR activity in epithelial tissues are poorly understood. Here we show that CFTR is regulated by an epithelially expressed syntaxin (syntaxin 1A), a membrane protein that also modulates neurosecretion and calcium-channel gating in brain. Syntaxin 1A physically interacts with CFTR chloride channels and regulates CFTR-mediated currents both in Xenopus oocytes and in epithelial cells that normally express these proteins. The physical and functional interactions between syntaxin 1A and CFTR are blocked by a syntaxin-binding protein of the Munc18 protein family (also called n-Secl). Our results indicate that CFTR function in epithelial cells is regulated by an interplay between syntaxin and Munc18 isoforms.
Neuromotor prostheses (NMPs) aim to replace or restore lost motor functions in paralysed humans by routeing movement-related signals from the brain, around damaged parts of the nervous system, to external effectors. To translate preclinical results from intact animals to a clinically useful NMP, movement signals must persist in cortex after spinal cord injury and be engaged by movement intent when sensory inputs and limb movement are long absent. Furthermore, NMPs would require that intention-driven neuronal activity be converted into a control signal that enables useful tasks. Here we show initial results for a tetraplegic human (MN) using a pilot NMP. Neuronal ensemble activity recorded through a 96-microelectrode array implanted in primary motor cortex demonstrated that intended hand motion modulates cortical spiking patterns three years after spinal cord injury. Decoders were created, providing a 'neural cursor' with which MN opened simulated e-mail and operated devices such as a television, even while conversing. Furthermore, MN used neural control to open and close a prosthetic hand, and perform rudimentary actions with a multi-jointed robotic arm. These early results suggest that NMPs based upon intracortical neuronal ensemble spiking activity could provide a valuable new neurotechnology to restore independence for humans with paralysis.
A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded orientation, position and object category from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.
JNPL3 transgenic mice expressing a mutant tau protein, which develop neurofibrillary tangles and progressive motor disturbance, were crossed with Tg2576 transgenic mice expressing mutant beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), thus modulating the APP-Abeta (beta-amyloid peptide) environment. The resulting double mutant (tau/APP) progeny and the Tg2576 parental strain developed Abeta deposits at the same age; however, relative to JNPL3 mice, the double mutants exhibited neurofibrillary tangle pathology that was substantially enhanced in the limbic system and olfactory cortex. These results indicate that either APP or Abeta influences the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The interaction between Abeta and tau pathologies in these mice supports the hypothesis that a similar interaction occurs in Alzheimer's disease.
The nonparticulate fraction of homogenates of heart, liver, kidney, lung, and cerebral cortex from human fetuses of varying gestational ages was subjected to electrophoresis on starch grains. Five lactic dehydrogenases and two malic dehydrogenases with characteristic rates with pyridine nucleotide analogs were found in all tissues at all ages. Quantitative differences in the relative proportions of these peaks were observed as gestation proceeded.
Comparison of birds and pterosaurs, the two archosaurian flyers, sheds light on adaptation to an aerial lifestyle. The neurological basis of control holds particular interest in that flight demands on sensory integration, equilibrium, and muscular coordination are acute. Here we compare the brain and vestibular apparatus in two pterosaurs based on high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) scans from which we constructed digital endocasts. Although general neural organization resembles birds, pterosaurs had smaller brains relative to body mass than do birds. This difference probably has more to do with phylogeny than flight, in that birds evolved from nonavian theropods that had already established trends for greater encephalization. Orientation of the osseous labyrinth relative to the long axis of the skull was different in these two pterosaur species, suggesting very different head postures and reflecting differing behaviours. Their enlarged semicircular canals reflect a highly refined organ of equilibrium, which is concordant with pterosaurs being visually based, aerial predators. Their enormous cerebellar floccular lobes may suggest neural integration of extensive sensory information from the wing, further enhancing eye- and neck-based reflex mechanisms for stabilizing gaze.
Voltage-sensitive dyes allow neuronal activity to be studied by non-invasive optical techniques. They provide an attractive means of investigating striate cortex, where important response properties are organized in two dimensions. In the present study, patterns of ocular dominance and orientation selectivity were obtained repeatedly from the same patch of cortex using the dye merocyanine oxazolone, together with current image-processing techniques. The patterns observed agree with most established features of monkey striate cortex and suggest a new unit of cortical organization; one that is modular in structure and which appears to link the organization of orientation selectivity with that of ocular dominance.
Worldwide, 100 million people are expected to die this century from the consequences of nicotine addiction, but nicotine is also known to enhance cognitive performance. Identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in nicotine reinforcement and cognition is a priority and requires the development of new in vivo experimental paradigms. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain is thought to mediate the reinforcement properties of many drugs of abuse. Here we specifically re-expressed the beta2-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) by stereotaxically injecting a lentiviral vector into the VTA of mice carrying beta2-subunit deletions. We demonstrate the efficient re-expression of electrophysiologically responsive, ligand-binding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in dopamine-containing neurons of the VTA, together with the recovery of nicotine-elicited dopamine release and nicotine self-administration. We also quantified exploratory behaviours of the mice, and showed that beta2-subunit re-expression restored slow exploratory behaviour (a measure of cognitive function) to wild-type levels, but did not affect fast navigation behaviour. We thus demonstrate the sufficient role of the VTA in both nicotine reinforcement and endogenous cholinergic regulation of cognitive functions.
In the visual cortex of kittens that have received their only visual experience while wearing a high-power lens before one eye, most neurons are dominated by input from the normal eye. Moreover, contrast sensitivity and resolving power are lower for stimulation through the originally defocused eye, mimicking psychophysical results from human anisometropic amblyopes.
The human voice contains in its acoustic structure a wealth of information on the speaker's identity and emotional state which we perceive with remarkable ease and accuracy. Although the perception of speaker-related features of voice plays a major role in human communication, little is known about its neural basis. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in human volunteers, that voice-selective regions can be found bilaterally along the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). These regions showed greater neuronal activity when subjects listened passively to vocal sounds, whether speech or non-speech, than to non-vocal environmental sounds. Central STS regions also displayed a high degree of selectivity by responding significantly more to vocal sounds than to matched control stimuli, including scrambled voices and amplitude-modulated noise. Moreover, their response to stimuli degraded by frequency filtering paralleled the subjects' behavioural performance in voice-perception tasks that used these stimuli. The voice-selective areas in the STS may represent the counterpart of the face-selective areas in human visual cortex; their existence sheds new light on the functional architecture of the human auditory cortex.
Primates are equipped with neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex, the parietal cortex and the basal ganglia that predict the availability of reward during the performance of behavioural tasks. It is not known, however, how reward value is incorporated in the control of action. Here we identify neurons in the monkey caudate nucleus that create a spatially selective response bias depending on the expected gain. In behavioural tasks, the monkey had to make a visually guided eye movement in every trial, but was rewarded for a correct response in only half of the trials. Reward availability was predictable on the basis of the spatial position of the visual target. We found that caudate neurons change their discharge rate systematically, even before the appearance of the visual target, and usually fire more when the contralateral position is associated with reward. Strong anticipatory activity of neurons with a contralateral preference is associated with decreased latency for eye movements in the contralateral direction. We conclude that this neuronal mechanism creates an advance bias that favours a spatial response when it is associated with a high reward value.
gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, is known to operate bicuculline-sensitive Cl- channels through GABAA receptors and bicuculline-insensitive cation channels through GABAB receptors. Recent observations indicate that the retina may contain GABA receptors with unusual pharmacological properties. Here we report that GABA gates bicuculline-insensitive Cl- channels in rod bipolar cells of the rat retina, which were not modulated by flunitrazepam, pentobarbital and alphaxalone and were only slightly blocked by picrotoxinin. Moreover, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen, and the antagonist 2-hydroxysaclofen had no effect. The underlying single-channel conductance was 7 pS and the open time 150 ms. These values are clearly different from those obtained for GABAA receptor channels recorded in other neurons of the same preparation, and in other parts of the brain. The bicuculline- and baclofen-insensitive GABA receptors were activated selectively by the GABA analogue cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA). Hence they may be similar to those receptors termed GABAC receptors.
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a monoaminergic neurotransmitter that is believed to modulate numerous sensory, motor and behavioural processes in the mammalian nervous system. These diverse responses are elicited through the activation of a large family of receptor subtypes. The complexity of this signalling system and the paucity of selective drugs have made it difficult to define specific roles for 5-HT receptor subtypes, or to determine how serotonergic drugs modulate mood and behaviour. To address these issues, we have generated mutant mice lacking functional 5-HT2C receptors (previously termed 5-HT1C), prominent G-protein-coupled receptors that are widely expressed throughout the brain and spinal cord and which have been proposed to mediate numerous central nervous system (CNS) actions of serotonin. Here we show that 5-HT2C receptor-deficient mice are overweight as a result of abnormal control of feeding behaviour, establishing a role for this receptor in the serotonergic control of appetite. Mutant animals are also prone to spontaneous death from seizures, suggesting that 5-HT2C receptors mediate tonic inhibition of neuronal network excitability.
Many representations of sensory stimuli in the neocortex are arranged as topographic maps. These cortical maps are not fixed, but show experience-dependent plasticity. For instance, sensory deprivation causes the cortical area representing the deprived sensory input to shrink, and neighbouring spared representations to enlarge, in somatosensory, auditory or visual cortex. In adolescent and adult animals, changes in cortical maps are most noticeable in the supragranular layers at the junction of deprived and spared cortex. However, the cellular mechanisms of this experience-dependent plasticity are unclear. Long-term potentiation and depression have been implicated, but have not been proven to be necessary or sufficient for cortical map reorganization. Short-term synaptic dynamics have not been considered. We developed a brain slice preparation involving rat whisker barrel cortex in vitro. Here we report that sensory deprivation alters short-term synaptic dynamics in both vertical and horizontal excitatory pathways within the supragranular cortex. Moreover, modifications of horizontal pathways amplify changes in the vertical inputs. Our findings help to explain the functional cortical reorganization that follows persistent changes of sensory experience.
While it is widely appreciated that infection with a virulent virus can produce disease in an animal, the ability of a mixture of avirulent viruses to produce disease by means of complementation or recombination in vivo has not been established. In this study, two weakly neuroinvasive herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strains were simultaneously inoculated onto the footpads of mice. Many (62%) of the animals that received a 1:1 mixture of the viruses died, whereas the animals that received a similar or 100-fold higher dose of each agent alone survived. Of fourteen viruses isolated from the brains of ten mice that died after receiving the mixture of the two weakly neuroinvasive viruses, eleven were recombinants; three of these recombinants were lethal when reapplied to the footpads of mice. These results show that two avirulent HSV-1 variants may interact in vivo to produce virulent recombinants and a lethal infection. They also suggest that different genetic lesions account for the weakly neuroinvasive character of the HSV-1 strains ANG and KOS after footpad inoculation.
Deficiency in monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), an enzyme that degrades serotonin and norepinephrine, has recently been shown to be associated with aggressive behavior in men of a Dutch family. A line of transgenic mice was isolated in which transgene integration caused a deletion in the gene encoding MAOA, providing an animal model of MAOA deficiency. In pup brains, serotonin concentrations were increased up to ninefold, and serotonin-like immunoreactivity was present in catecholaminergic neurons. In pup and adult brains, norepinephrine concentrations were increased up to twofold, and cytoarchitectural changes were observed in the somatosensory cortex. Pup behavioral alterations, including trembling, difficulty in righting, and fearfulness were reversed by the serotonin synthesis inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine. Adults manifested a distinct behavioral syndrome, including enhanced aggression in males.
Regional brain activation was assessed by mapping of Fos-related protein expression in rats trained to self-administration of intravenous nicotine and cocaine. Both drugs produced specific overlapping patterns of activation in the shell and the core of the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and medial caudate areas, but not in the amygdala. Thus, the reinforcing properties of cocaine and nicotine map on selected structures of the terminal fields of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, supporting the idea that common substrates for these addictive drugs exist.
Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) are modulators of synaptic plasticity, oscillatory behavior, and rhythmic firing in brain regions such as the hippocampus. The distribution and lateral mobility of VDCCs on CA1 hippocampal neurons have been determined with biologically active fluorescent and biotinylated derivatives of the selective probe omega-conotoxin in conjunction with circular dityndallism, digital fluorescence imaging, and photobleach recovery microscopy. On noninnervated cell bodies, VDCCs were found to be organized in multiple clusters, whereas after innervation the VDCCs were concentrated and immobilized at synaptic contact sites. On dendrites, VDCC distribution was punctate and was interrupted by extensive bare regions or abruptly terminated. More than 85% of the dendritic VDCCs were found to be immobile by fluorescence photobleach recovery. Thus, before synaptic contact, specific mechanisms target, segregate, and immobilize VDCCs to neuronal cell bodies and to specialized dendritic sites. Regulation of this distribution may be critical in determining the firing activity and integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 neurons.
By means of antiserum (purified by affinity chromatography) directed against adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) 11-24, cell bodies and beaded axons were visualized in rat brain. The ACTH-like immunoreactivity (ACTH-LI) was primarily located in the hypothalamus (cells and axons). Fibers were scattered throughout thalamus, amygdala, periaqueductal gray area, and reticular formation. There was no change in the distribution of ACTH-LI in rats that had been subjected to hypophysectomy. This distribution of ACTH-LI parallels that of beta-lipotropin and is altered by specific lesions in a similar fashion. The presence of ACTH-LI in cells and beaded axons in brain raises the possibility that it is a neuroregulator functioning as a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, or neurohormone.
Since it was discovered that the anti-hypertensive agent ifenprodil has neuroprotective activity through its effects on NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, a determined effort has been made to understand the mechanism of action and to develop improved therapeutic compounds on the basis of this knowledge. Neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors is essential for basic brain development and function. These receptors form heteromeric ion channels and become activated after concurrent binding of glycine and glutamate to the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, respectively. A functional hallmark of NMDA receptors is that their ion-channel activity is allosterically regulated by binding of small compounds to the amino-terminal domain (ATD) in a subtype-specific manner. Ifenprodil and related phenylethanolamine compounds, which specifically inhibit GluN1 and GluN2B NMDA receptors, have been intensely studied for their potential use in the treatment of various neurological disorders and diseases, including depression, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Despite considerable enthusiasm, mechanisms underlying the recognition of phenylethanolamines and ATD-mediated allosteric inhibition remain limited owing to a lack of structural information. Here we report that the GluN1 and GluN2B ATDs form a heterodimer and that phenylethanolamine binds at the interface between GluN1 and GluN2B, rather than within the GluN2B cleft. The crystal structure of the heterodimer formed between the GluN1b ATD from Xenopus laevis and the GluN2B ATD from Rattus norvegicus shows a highly distinct pattern of subunit arrangement that is different from the arrangements observed in homodimeric non-NMDA receptors and reveals the molecular determinants for phenylethanolamine binding. Restriction of domain movement in the bi-lobed structure of the GluN2B ATD, by engineering of an inter-subunit disulphide bond, markedly decreases sensitivity to ifenprodil, indicating that conformational freedom in the GluN2B ATD is essential for ifenprodil-mediated allosteric inhibition of NMDA receptors. These findings pave the way for improving the design of subtype-specific compounds with therapeutic value for neurological disorders and diseases.
Although it has long been thought that the prefrontal cortex of primates is involved in the integrative regulation of behaviours, the neural architecture underlying specific aspects of cognitive behavioural planning has yet to be clarified. If subjects are required to remember a large number of complex motor sequences and plan to execute each of them individually, categorization of the sequences according to the specific temporal structure inherent in each subset of sequences serves to facilitate higher-order planning based on memory. Here we show, using these requirements, that cells in the lateral prefrontal cortex selectively exhibit activity for a specific category of behavioural sequences, and that categories of behaviours, embodied by different types of movement sequences, are represented in prefrontal cells during the process of planning. This cellular activity implies the generation of neural representations capable of storing structured event complexes at an abstract level, exemplifying the development of macro-structured action knowledge in the lateral prefrontal cortex.
To provide information about dynamic sensory stimuli, the pattern of action potentials in spiking neurons must be variable. To ensure reliability these variations must be related, reproducibly, to the stimulus. For H1, a motion-sensitive neuron in the fly's visual system, constant-velocity motion produces irregular spike firing patterns, and spike counts typically have a variance comparable to the mean, for cells in the mammalian cortex. But more natural, time-dependent input signals yield patterns of spikes that are much more reproducible, both in terms of timing and of counting precision. Variability and reproducibility are quantified with ideas from information theory, and measured spike sequences in H1 carry more than twice the amount of information they would if they followed the variance-mean relation seen with constant inputs. Thus, models that may accurately account for the neural response to static stimuli can significantly underestimate the reliability of signal transfer under more natural conditions.
Autoradiographic studies with 3H-labeled 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] demonstrate, in certain neurons of rat forebrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord, a nuclear retention and concentration of radioactivity, which can be prevented by treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, but not with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. These results indicate the presence of brain receptors in addition to pituitary receptors for 1,25(OH)2D3 and suggest a central modulation of calcium homeostasis and other central effects for this hormone. The existence of a brain-pituitary axis for certain 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated endocrine-autonomic effects is postulated.
The human left and right cerebral hemispheres are anatomically and functionally asymmetric. To test whether human cortical asymmetry has a molecular basis, we studied gene expression levels between the left and right embryonic hemispheres using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). We identified and verified 27 differentially expressed genes, which suggests that human cortical asymmetry is accompanied by early, marked transcriptional asymmetries. LMO4 is consistently more highly expressed in the right perisylvian human cerebral cortex than in the left and is essential for cortical development in mice, suggesting that human left-right specialization reflects asymmetric cortical development at early stages.
Theories of the regulation of cognition suggest a system with two necessary components: one to implement control and another to monitor performance and signal when adjustments in control are needed. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and a task-switching version of the Stroop task were used to examine whether these components of cognitive control have distinct neural bases in the human brain. A double dissociation was found. During task preparation, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9) was more active for color naming than for word reading, consistent with a role in the implementation of control. In contrast, the anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann's areas 24 and 32) was more active when responding to incongruent stimuli, consistent with a role in performance monitoring.
How organisms (including people) recognize distant objects is a fundamental question. The correspondence between object characteristics (distal stimuli), like visual shape, and sensory characteristics (proximal stimuli), like retinal projection, is ambiguous. The view that sensory systems are 'designed' to 'pick up' ecologically useful information is vague about how such mechanisms might work. In echolocating dolphins, which are studied as models for object recognition sonar systems, the correspondence between echo characteristics and object characteristics is less clear. Many cognitive scientists assume that object characteristics are extracted from proximal stimuli, but evidence for this remains ambiguous. For example, a dolphin may store 'sound templates' in its brain and identify whole objects by listening for a particular sound. Alternatively, a dolphin's brain may contain algorithms, derived through natural endowments or experience or both, which allow it to identify object characteristics based on sounds. The standard method used to address this question in many species is indirect and has led to equivocal results with dolphins. Here we outline an appropriate method and test it to show that dolphins extract object characteristics directly from echoes.
