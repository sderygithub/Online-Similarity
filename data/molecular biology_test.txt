The antigen-combining site of antibody molecules consists of six separate loops supported by a conserved beta-sheet framework; antibody specificity arises from length and sequence variation of these 'hypervariable' loops and can be manipulated by transferring sets of loops between different frameworks. Irregular loops are the most difficult parts of protein structure to understand and to model correctly. Here, we describe two computer experiments where all the hypervariable loops were deleted from X-ray structures of mouse immunoglobulins and reconstructed using the conformational search program CONGEN. A protocol was developed for reconstruction of the hypervariable loops in McPC 603 antibody. Calculated loop conformations were generated and a model of the combining site was built from selected low-energy conformations. We then modelled hypervariable loops in another antibody molecule, HyHEL-5. Both models agreed well with the known crystal structures. Our results hold out promise for the success of future modelling studies of complete antigen-combining sites from amino acid sequences.
The internal rotation barrier in ethane appears susceptible to "explanation" at a qualitative, intuitively useful, reasonably correct level. At this level, localized and delocalized MO's each produce a description. For a rigid rotation, the delocalized description is basically the "orbital control" type familiar from Woodward-Hoffmann rules (30), Walsh's rules (31), and the formation of diatomic molecules (32). This description indicates that long-range eclipsed H---H antibonding is responsible for the barrier. The equivalent localized-bond description invokes destructive interference or repulsion between eclipsed C-H bonds. The extension of this kind of description to other molecules requires care. Subsequent to rigid rotation, the relaxation of ethane into its optimum eclipsed geometry produces almost no energy change but produces an unknown degree of energy "redistribution." I have emphasized that the theoretical distinction between "orbital control" and "steric interaction" is not precise and that a clarification in terminology may be desirable in this connection. The discussion of barriers given here applies only to a limited class of molecules, exemplified by ethane. No doubt, additional factors enter into a proper description of barriers in molecules having lower symmetry or more polar bonds, or both (33). Finally, I should point out that approaches other than those in categories 1 to 3 have been made in efforts to rationalize or predict barriers to internal rotation (34). The Hellmann-Feynman theorem has been applied to find the torque on ethane at conformations between staggered and eclipsed (35). The integral Hellmann-Feynman theorem has served as a basis for discussing barriers in terms of transition densities (36) and has led to an electrostatic model for barriers which has given some remarkably successful barrier predictions (37). These approaches are mathematically valid, and it is perfectly legitimate to try to extract physical explanations from them also. Thus, several valid explanations for the barrier to internal rotation in ethane are possible. However, I feel that the explanations proposed above in terms of delocalized or localized orbitals are preferable at present inasmuch as they are couched in terms and concepts currently in the mainstream of chemical thinking.
Tube-like motion of a single, fluorescently labeled molecule of DNA in an entangled solution of unlabeled lambda-phage DNA molecules was observed by fluorescence microscopy. One end of a 16- to 100-micrometer-long DNA was attached to a 1-micrometer bead and moved with optical tweezers. The molecule was stretched into various conformations having bends, kinks, and loops. As the polymer relaxed, it closely followed a path defined by its initial contour. The relaxation time of the disturbance caused by the bead was roughly 1 second, whereas tube-like motion in small loops persisted for longer than 2 minutes. Tube deformation, constraint release, and excess chain segment diffusion were also observed. These observations provide direct evidence for several key assumptions in the reptation model developed by de Gennes, Edwards, and Doi.
Ras proteins participate as a molecular switch in the early steps of the signal transduction pathway that is associated with cell growth and differentiation. When the protein is in its GTP complexed form it is active in signal transduction, whereas it is inactive in its GDP complexed form. A comparison of eight three-dimensional structures of ras proteins in four different crystal lattices, five with a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog and three with GDP, reveals that the "on" and "off" states of the switch are distinguished by conformational differences that span a length of more than 40 A, and are induced by the gamma-phosphate. The most significant differences are localized in two regions: residues 30 to 38 (the switch I region) in the second loop and residues 60 to 76 (the switch II region) consisting of the fourth loop and the short alpha-helix that follows the loop. Both regions are highly exposed and form a continuous strip on the molecular surface most likely to be the recognition sites for the effector and receptor molecule(or molecules). The conformational differences also provide a structural basis for understanding the biological and biochemical changes of the proteins due to oncogenic mutations, autophosphorylation, and GTP hydrolysis, and for understanding the interactions with other proteins.
Adenosine monophosphate is required for the activation of glycogen phosphorylase b and for release of the inhibition of phosphorylase a by glucose. Two molecules of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) bind to symmetry related sites at the subunit interface of the phosphorylase dimer. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds to the same site, but does not promote catalytic activity. The structure of glucose-inhibited phosphorylase a bound to AMP and also of the complex formed with glucose and ATP is described. Crystallographic refinement of these complexes reveals that structural changes are associated with AMP but not ATP binding. The origin of these effects can be traced to different effector binding modes exhibited by AMP and ATP, respectively. The conformational changes associated with AMP binding traverse multiple paths in the enzyme and link the effector and catalytic sites.
T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) generally interact with moderate affinity with the complex formed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and foreign peptides. MHC/TCR recognition is followed by the generation of a signal to the T cell through a monomorphic multicomponent system that includes the CD3 complex and accessory molecules such as CD4 and CD8. The interaction between the extracellular domains of MHC and TCR molecules, and the interaction of MHC and CD4/CD8 molecules, have been considered to occur independently of one another. We report here that the affinity of CD8 dimers for MHC class I molecules is independent of haplotype and peptide content, and that the affinity of the TCR for its specific ligand is enhanced through a reduced 'off' rate in the presence of either CD8alpha alpha homo- or CD8alpha beta heterodimers. Moreover, CD8 seems to help recognition of the specific MHC-peptide complex either by guiding an energetically favourable docking of TCR onto MHC, or by inducing conformational changes in the MHC complex that can augment the TCR/MHC-peptide interaction. CD8 should therefore be considered as an active participant in the T-cell recognition complex, rather than simply as an accessory molecule.
RNA molecules are thought to have been prominent in the early history of life on Earth because of their ability both to encode genetic information and to exhibit catalytic function. The modern genetic alphabet relies on two sets of complementary base pairs to store genetic information. However, owing to the chemical instability of cytosine, which readily deaminates to uracil, a primitive genetic system composed of the bases A, U, G and C may have been difficult to establish. It has been suggested that the first genetic material instead contained only a single base-pairing unit. Here we show that binary informational macromolecules, containing only two different nucleotide subunits, can act as catalysts. In vitro evolution was used to obtain ligase ribozymes composed of only 2,6-diaminopurine and uracil nucleotides, which catalyse the template-directed joining of two RNA molecules, one bearing a 5'-triphosphate and the other a 3'-hydroxyl. The active conformation of the fastest isolated ribozyme had a catalytic rate that was about 36,000-fold faster than the uncatalysed rate of reaction. This ribozyme is specific for the formation of biologically relevant 3',5'-phosphodiester linkages.
The structure of a heterotrimeric G protein reveals the mechanism of the nucleotide-dependent engagement of the alpha and beta gamma subunits that regulates their interaction with receptor and effector molecules. The interaction involves two distinct interfaces and dramatically alters the conformation of the alpha but not of the beta gamma subunits. The location of the known sites for post-translational modification and receptor coupling suggest a plausible orientation with respect to the membrane surface and an activated heptahelical receptor.
Here we report an approach, based on antibody phage display, to generate molecular conformation sensors. Recombinant antibodies specific to the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound conformation of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rab6, a regulator of membrane traffic, were generated and used to locate Rab6.GTP in fixed cells, and, after green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging and intracellular expression, to follow Rab6.GTP in vivo. Rab6 was in its GTP-bound conformation on the Golgi apparatus and transport intermediates, and the geometry of transport intermediates was modulated by Rab6 activity. More generally, the same approach could be applied to other molecules that can be locked in a particular conformation in vitro.
A molecularly thin film of a two-dimensional polymer network formed by hydrogen bonding was synthesized and investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy. Poly(in-caprolactam) (nylon 6) was epitaxially grown on the basal plane of graphite and an ultrathin film of the polymer was obtained after the bulk materials had been washed away with solvents. The polymer chain has a planar, all-trans conformation and adjacent chains run in the antiparallel direction. This produces complete pairing of hydrogen bonding groups, with each amide group lying on a straight line perpendicular to the polymer backbone. This hydrogen-bonded sheet is oriented so that each polymer backbone lies in the (1010) direction on the graphite hexagonal lattice, as opposed to the (1120) direction taken by other paraffinic molecules studied so far. This experiment shows that hydrogen bonding can be used to control the orientation of macromolecules in two dimensions.
Myosins are motor proteins in cells. They move along actin by changing shape after making stereospecific interactions with the actin subunits. As these are arranged helically, a succession of steps will follow a helical path. However, if the myosin heads are long enough to span the actin helical repeat (approximately 36 nm), linear motion is possible. Muscle myosin (myosin II) heads are about 16 nm long, which is insufficient to span the repeat. Myosin V, however, has heads of about 31 nm that could span 36 nm and thus allow single two-headed molecules to transport cargo by walking straight. Here we use electron microscopy to show that while working, myosin V spans the helical repeat. The heads are mostly 13 actin subunits apart, with values of 11 or 15 also found. Typically the structure is polar and one head is curved, the other straighter. Single particle processing reveals the polarity of the underlying actin filament, showing that the curved head is the leading one. The shape of the leading head may correspond to the beginning of the working stroke of the motor. We also observe molecules attached by one head in this conformation.
Species of RNA that bind with high affinity and specificity to the bronchodilator theophylline were identified by selection from an oligonucleotide library. One RNA molecule binds to theophylline with a dissociation constant Kd of 0.1 microM. This binding affinity is 10,000-fold greater than the RNA molecule's affinity for caffeine, which differs from theophylline only by a methyl group at nitrogen atom N-7. Analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance indicates that this RNA molecule undergoes a significant change in its conformation or dynamics upon theophylline binding. Binding studies of compounds chemically related to theophylline have revealed structural features required for the observed binding specificity. These results demonstrate the ability of RNA molecules to exhibit an extremely high degree of ligand recognition and discrimination.
Transfer RNAs are among the most ubiquitous molecules in cells, central to decoding information from messenger RNAs on translating ribosomes. In eukaryotic cells, tRNAs are actively transported from their site of synthesis in the nucleus to their site of function in the cytosol. This is mediated by a dedicated nucleo-cytoplasmic transport factor of the karyopherin-beta family (Xpot, also known as Los1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Here we report the 3.2 A resolution structure of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Xpot in complex with tRNA and RanGTP, and the 3.1 A structure of unbound Xpot, revealing both nuclear and cytosolic snapshots of this transport factor. Xpot undergoes a large conformational change on binding cargo, wrapping around the tRNA and, in particular, binding to the tRNA 5' and 3' ends. The binding mode explains how Xpot can recognize all mature tRNAs in the cell and yet distinguish them from those that have not been properly processed, thus coupling tRNA export to quality control.
The three-dimensional structures of an antibody to a peptide and its complex with the peptide antigen have been determined at 2.8 A resolution. The antigen is a synthetic 19-amino acid peptide homolog of the C helix of myohemerythrin (Mhr). The unliganded Fab' crystals are orthorhombic with two molecules per asymmetric unit, whereas the complex crystals are hexagonal with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The Fab' and the Fab'-peptide complex structures have been solved independently by molecular replacement methods and have crystallographic R factors of 0.197 and 0.215, respectively, with no water molecules included. The amino-terminal portion of the peptide sequence (NH2-Glu-Val-Val-Pro-His-Lys-Lys) is clearly interpretable in the electron density map of the Fab'-peptide complex and adopts a well-defined type II beta-turn in the concave antigen binding pocket. This same peptide amino acid sequence in native Mhr is alpha-helical. The peptide conformation when bound to the Fab' is inconsistent with binding of the Fab' to native Mhr, and suggests that binding of the Fab' to conformationally altered forms of the native Mhr or to apo-Mhr. Immunological mapping previously identified this sequence as the peptide epitope, and its fine specificity correlates well with the structural analysis. The binding pocket includes a large percentage of hydrophobic residues. The buried surfaces of the peptide and the antibody are complementary in shape and cover 460 A2 and 540 A2, respectively. These two structures now enable a comparison of a specific monoclonal Fab' both in its free and antigen complexed state. While no major changes in the antibody were observed when peptide was bound, there were some small but significant side chain and main chain rearrangements.
Stochastic on-off conductivity switching observed in phenylene-ethynylene oligomers has been explained in terms of changes in ring conformations, or electron localization, or both. We report the observation of stochastic on-off switching in the simplest of wired molecules: octanedithiol, decanedithiol, and dodecanedithiol bonded on an Au(111) surface. Stochastic switching was observed even when a top gold contact was pressed on by a conducting atomic force microscope tip at constant force. The rate of switching increased substantially at 60 degrees C, a temperature at which these films are commonly annealed. Because such switching in alkanethiols is unlikely to be caused by internal molecular electronic changes and cannot be fully accounted for by breaking of the top contact, we argue that the cause is the well-known mobility of molecules tethered to gold via a thiol linkage.
DnaK and other members of the 70-kilodalton heat-shock protein (hsp70) family promote protein folding, interaction, and translocation, both constitutively and in response to stress, by binding to unfolded polypeptide segments. These proteins have two functional units: a substrate-binding portion binds the polypeptide, and an adenosine triphosphatase portion facilitates substrate exchange. The crystal structure of a peptide complex with the substrate-binding unit of DnaK has now been determined at 2.0 angstroms resolution. The structure consists of a beta-sandwich subdomain followed by alpha-helical segments. The peptide is bound to DnaK in an extended conformation through a channel defined by loops from the beta sandwich. An alpha-helical domain stabilizes the complex, but does not contact the peptide directly. This domain is rotated in the molecules of a second crystal lattice, which suggests a model of conformation-dependent substrate binding that features a latch mechanism for maintaining long lifetime complexes.
The job of a protein can be altered by addition of molecules such as ubiquitin or the related ubiquitin-like modifiers, which bring about changes in the protein's localization, conformation, or its interactions with other proteins. In a comprehensive Perspective, Hochstrasser brings us up to date with the many new members of the ubiquitin modifier family and their multitudinous and diverse protein targets.
1) Induction of humoral antibody formation involves the obligatory recognition of two determinants on an antigen, one by the receptor antibody of the antigen-sensitive cell and the other by carrier antibody (associative interaction). 2) Paralysis of antibody formation involves the obligatory recognition of only one determinant by the receptor antibody of the antigen-sensitive cell; that is, a nonimmunogenic molecule (a hapten) can paralyze antigen-sensitive cells. 3) There is competition between paralysis and induction at the level of the antigen-sensitive cell. 4) The mechanisms of low- and high-zone paralysis, and maintenance of the unresponsive state, are identical. 5) High-zone paralysis occurs when both the carrier antibody and the receptor antibody are saturated, so that associated interactions cannot take place. 6) The mechanisms of paralysis and induction for the carrier-antigen-sensitive cell are identical to those for the humoral-antigen-sensitive cell. 7) The formation of carrier-antigen-sensitive cells is thymus-dependent, whereas humoral-antigen-sensitive cells are derived from bone marrow. Since carrier antibody is required for induction, all antigens are thymus-dependent. 8) The interaction of antigen with the receptor antibody on an antigen-sensitive cell results in a conformational change in an invariant region of the receptor and consequently paralyzes the cell. As the receptor is probably identical to the induced antibody, all antibody molecules are expected to be able to undergo a conformational change on binding a hapten. The obligatory associated recognition by way of carrier antibody (inductive signal) involves a conformational change in the carrier antibody, leading to a second signal to the antigen-sensitive cell. 9) The foregoing requirements provide an explanation for self-nonself discrimination. Tolerance to self-antigens involves a specific deletion in the activity of both the humoral- and the carrier-antigen-sensitive cells.
Proteins and RNA are unique among known polymers in their ability to adopt compact and well-defined folding patterns. These two biopolymers can perform complex chemical operations such as catalysis and highly selective recognition, and these functions are linked to folding in that the creation of an active site requires proper juxtaposition of reactive groups. So the development of new types of polymeric backbones with well-defined and predictable folding propensities ('foldamers') might lead to molecules with useful functions. The first step in foldamer development is to identify synthetic oligomers with specific secondary structural preferences. Whereas alpha-amino acids can adopt the well-known alpha-helical motif of proteins, it was shown recently that beta-peptides constructed from carefully chosen beta-amino acids can adopt a different, stable helical conformation defined by interwoven 14-membered-ring hydrogen bonds (a 14-helix; Fig. 1a). Here we report that beta-amino acids can also be used to design beta-peptides with a very different secondary structure, a 12-helix (Fig. 1a). This demonstrates that by altering the nature of beta-peptide residues, one can exert rational control over the secondary structure.
COPII-coated vesicles form on the endoplasmic reticulum by the stepwise recruitment of three cytosolic components: Sar1-GTP to initiate coat formation, Sec23/24 heterodimer to select SNARE and cargo molecules, and Sec13/31 to induce coat polymerization and membrane deformation. Crystallographic analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec23/24-Sar1 complex reveals a bow-tie-shaped structure, 15 nm long, with a membrane-proximal surface that is concave and positively charged to conform to the size and acidic-phospholipid composition of the COPII vesicle. Sec23 and Sar1 form a continuous surface stabilized by a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, and Sar1 has rearranged from the GDP conformation to expose amino-terminal residues that will probably embed in the bilayer. The GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity of Sec23 involves an arginine side chain inserted into the Sar1 active site. These observations establish the structural basis for GTP-dependent recruitment of a vesicular coat complex, and for uncoating through coat-controlled GTP hydrolysis.
Major pathways of recombinational DNA repair in Escherichia coli require the RecBCD protein--a heterotrimeric, ATP-driven, DNA translocating motor enzyme. RecBCD combines a highly processive and exceptionally fast helicase (DNA-unwinding) activity with a strand-specific nuclease (DNA-cleaving) activity (refs 1, 2 and references therein). Recognition of the DNA sequence 'chi' (5'-GCTGGTGG-3') switches the polarity of DNA cleavage and stimulates recombination at nearby sequences in vivo. Here we attach microscopic polystyrene beads to biotin-tagged RecD protein subunits and use tethered-particle light microscopy to observe translocation of single RecBCD molecules (with a precision of up to approximately 30 nm at 2 Hz) and to examine the mechanism by which chi modifies enzyme activity. Observed translocation is unidirectional, with each molecule moving at a constant velocity corresponding to the population-average DNA unwinding rate. These observations place strong constraints on possible movement mechanisms. Bead release at chi is negligible, showing that the activity modification at chi does not require ejection of the RecD subunit from the enzyme as previously proposed; modification may occur through an unusual, pure conformational switch mechanism.
Interplay among four genes--egl-1, ced-9, ced-4 and ced-3--controls the onset of programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Activation of the cell-killing protease CED-3 requires CED-4. However, CED-4 is constitutively inhibited by CED-9 until its release by EGL-1. Here we report the crystal structure of the CED-4-CED-9 complex at 2.6 A resolution, and a complete reconstitution of the CED-3 activation pathway using homogeneous proteins of CED-4, CED-9 and EGL-1. One molecule of CED-9 binds to an asymmetric dimer of CED-4, but specifically recognizes only one of the two CED-4 molecules. This specific interaction prevents CED-4 from activating CED-3. EGL-1 binding induces pronounced conformational changes in CED-9 that result in the dissociation of the CED-4 dimer from CED-9. The released CED-4 dimer further dimerizes to form a tetramer, which facilitates the autoactivation of CED-3. Together, our studies provide important insights into the regulation of cell death activation in C. elegans.
Photosynthetic reaction centers convert the energy content of light into a transmembrane potential difference and so provide the major pathway for energy input into the biosphere. We applied time-resolved Laue diffraction to study light-induced conformational changes in the photosynthetic reaction center complex of Blastochloris viridis. The side chain of TyrL162, which lies adjacent to the special pair of bacteriochlorophyll molecules that are photooxidized in the primary light conversion event of photosynthesis, was observed to move 1.3 angstroms closer to the special pair after photoactivation. Free energy calculations suggest that this movement results from the deprotonation of this conserved tyrosine residue and provides a mechanism for stabilizing the primary charge separation reactions of photosynthesis.
The active site of various carbonic anhydrases is not blocked by DDT. DDE, or dieldrin. Impairment of catalytic efficiency can only be documented in opalescent test solutions in which the insecticides are present in excess of their solubility limit. These slowly forming precipitates occlude enzyme from solution and furnish a physical explanation of the supposed inhibition. The amounts occluded depend, among other things, on the conformational and topographical characteristics of the particular carbonic anhydrase molecules.
Bacteriophage lambda has for many years been a model system for understanding mechanisms of gene regulation. A 'genetic switch' enables the phage to transition from lysogenic growth to lytic development when triggered by specific environmental conditions. The key component of the switch is the cI repressor, which binds to two sets of three operator sites on the lambda chromosome that are separated by about 2,400 base pairs (bp). A hallmark of the lambda system is the pairwise cooperativity of repressor binding. In the absence of detailed structural information, it has been difficult to understand fully how repressor molecules establish the cooperativity complex. Here we present the X-ray crystal structure of the intact lambda cI repressor dimer bound to a DNA operator site. The structure of the repressor, determined by multiple isomorphous replacement methods, reveals an unusual overall architecture that allows it to adopt a conformation that appears to facilitate pairwise cooperative binding to adjacent operator sites.
Protein molecules undergo a series of conformational fluctuations ranging in degree from atomic vibrations to transient denaturation, even in physiological conditions. The rotational motions of amino acid side chains form an important subset of the types of fluctuation a protein can undergo. NMR and molecular dynamics have shown that methyl groups in proteins are not held in fixed positions, but spin rapidly around their rotor axes. The question then arises as to whether methyl groups in proteins predominantly adopt the 'staggered' conformation, favoured by the intrinsic barrier to rotation of these groups, or whether cooperative packing effects in the folded protein perturb the average configurations to higher torsional energy. We report here an investigation of the rotational conformations of the methyl groups of aliphatic side chains in the protein crambin by neutron diffraction. We find that in the time-averaged structure of this protein, the majority of methyl rotors adopt the staggered conformation. This is consistent with rotation being a quantized event consisting of rapid reorientations of approximately 120 degrees steps to positions of highest stability. The fact that the local environment does not dictate the low energy state of methyl groups suggests that within the seemingly close-packed interior structure of a protein, mutual packing accommodation occurs as a consequence of the inherent flexibility and small packing defects in protein structures.
The structure of a bacterial superantigen, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B, bound to a human class II histocompatibility complex molecule (HLA-DR1) has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The superantigen binds as an intact protein outside the conventional peptide antigen-binding site of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. No large conformational changes occur upon complex formation in either the DR1 or the enterotoxin B molecules. The structure of the complex helps explain how different class II molecules and superantigens associate and suggests a model for ternary complex formation with the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), in which unconventional TCR-MHC contacts are possible.
Vinculin is a highly conserved intracellular protein with a crucial role in the maintenance and regulation of cell adhesion and migration. In the cytosol, vinculin adopts a default autoinhibited conformation. On recruitment to cell-cell and cell-matrix adherens-type junctions, vinculin becomes activated and mediates various protein-protein interactions that regulate the links between F-actin and the cadherin and integrin families of cell-adhesion molecules. Here we describe the crystal structure of the full-length vinculin molecule (1,066 amino acids), which shows a five-domain autoinhibited conformation in which the carboxy-terminal tail domain is held pincer-like by the vinculin head, and ligand binding is regulated both sterically and allosterically. We show that conformational changes in the head, tail and proline-rich domains are linked structurally and thermodynamically, and propose a combinatorial pathway to activation that ensures that vinculin is activated only at sites of cell adhesion when two or more of its binding partners are brought into apposition.
The Li+-NAD+ complex exists as a 'dimer' of two molecules arranged head-to-tail with Li+ coordinated tetrahedrally to adenine N(7) and three pyrophosphate oxygens. Adenine is stacked intermolecularly on nicotinamide. The conformation of NAD+ is 'extended' and similar to that found in holoenzyme complexes. This is in contrast to the 'folded' structure proposed from spectroscopic studies.
Recent advances in single-molecule detection and single-molecule spectroscopy at room temperature by laser-induced fluorescence offer new tools for the study of individual macromolecules under physiological conditions. These tools relay conformational states, conformational dynamics, and activity of single biological molecules to physical observables, unmasked by ensemble averaging. Distributions and time trajectories of these observables can therefore be measured during a reaction without the impossible need to synchronize all the molecules in the ensemble. The progress in applying these tools to biological studies with the use of fluorophores that are site-specifically attached to macromolecules is reviewed.
We used a multiplexed approach based on flow-stretched DNA to monitor the enzymatic digestion of lambda-phage DNA by individual bacteriophage lambda exonuclease molecules. Statistical analyses of multiple single-molecule trajectories observed simultaneously reveal that the catalytic rate is dependent on the local base content of the substrate DNA. By relating single-molecule kinetics to the free energies of hydrogen bonding and base stacking, we establish that the melting of a base from the DNA is the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle. The catalytic rate also exhibits large fluctuations independent of the sequence, which we attribute to conformational changes of the enzyme-DNA complex.
Ligand binding to structural elements in the non-coding regions of messenger RNA modulates gene expression. Ligands such as free metabolites or other small molecules directly bind and induce conformational changes in regulatory RNA elements known as riboswitches. Other types of RNA switches are activated by complexed metabolites-for example, RNA-ligated metabolites such as aminoacyl-charged transfer RNA in the T-box system, or protein-bound metabolites in the glucose- or amino-acid-stimulated terminator-anti-terminator systems. All of these switch types are found in bacteria, fungi and plants. Here we report an RNA switch in human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA, also known as VEGF) mRNA 3' untranslated region (UTR) that integrates signals from interferon (IFN)-gamma and hypoxia to regulate VEGFA translation in myeloid cells. Analogous to riboswitches, the VEGFA 3' UTR undergoes a binary conformational change in response to environmental signals. However, the VEGFA 3' UTR switch is metabolite-independent, and the conformational change is dictated by mutually exclusive, stimulus-dependent binding of proteins, namely, the IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation complex and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL, also known as hnRNP L). We speculate that the VEGFA switch represents the founding member of a family of signal-mediated, protein-dependent RNA switches that evolved to regulate gene expression in multicellular animals in which the precise integration of disparate inputs may be more important than the rapidity of response.
Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is an integral membrane protein in the mitochondrial anion carrier protein family, the members of which facilitate the transport of small molecules across the mitochondrial inner membrane. When the mitochondrial respiratory complex pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, it builds up an electrochemical potential. A fraction of this electrochemical potential is dissipated as heat, in a process involving leakage of protons back to the matrix. This leakage, or 'uncoupling' of the proton electrochemical potential, is mediated primarily by uncoupling proteins. However, the mechanism of UCP-mediated proton translocation across the lipid bilayer is unknown. Here we describe a solution-NMR method for structural characterization of UCP2. The method, which overcomes some of the challenges associated with membrane-protein structure determination, combines orientation restraints derived from NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and semiquantitative distance restraints from paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements. The local and secondary structures of the protein were determined by piecing together molecular fragments from the Protein Data Bank that best fit experimental RDCs from samples weakly aligned in a DNA nanotube liquid crystal. The RDCs also determine the relative orientation of the secondary structural segments, and the PRE restraints provide their spatial arrangement in the tertiary fold. UCP2 closely resembles the bovine ADP/ATP carrier (the only carrier protein of known structure), but the relative orientations of the helical segments are different, resulting in a wider opening on the matrix side of the inner membrane. Moreover, the nitroxide-labelled GDP binds inside the channel and seems to be closer to transmembrane helices 1-4. We believe that this biophysical approach can be applied to other membrane proteins and, in particular, to other mitochondrial carriers, not only for structure determination but also to characterize various conformational states of these proteins linked to substrate transport.
Lens-specific aquaporin-0 (AQP0) functions as a specific water pore and forms the thin junctions between fibre cells. Here we describe a 1.9 A resolution structure of junctional AQP0, determined by electron crystallography of double-layered two-dimensional crystals. Comparison of junctional and non-junctional AQP0 structures shows that junction formation depends on a conformational switch in an extracellular loop, which may result from cleavage of the cytoplasmic amino and carboxy termini. In the centre of the water pathway, the closed pore in junctional AQP0 retains only three water molecules, which are too widely spaced to form hydrogen bonds with each other. Packing interactions between AQP0 tetramers in the crystalline array are mediated by lipid molecules, which assume preferred conformations. We were therefore able to build an atomic model for the lipid bilayer surrounding the AQP0 tetramers, and we describe lipid-protein interactions.
Investigating proteins 'at work' in a living environment at atomic resolution is a major goal of molecular biology, which has not been achieved even though methods for the three-dimensional (3D) structure determination of purified proteins in single crystals or in solution are widely used. Recent developments in NMR hardware and methodology have enabled the measurement of high-resolution heteronuclear multi-dimensional NMR spectra of macromolecules in living cells (in-cell NMR). Various intracellular events such as conformational changes, dynamics and binding events have been investigated by this method. However, the low sensitivity and the short lifetime of the samples have so far prevented the acquisition of sufficient structural information to determine protein structures by in-cell NMR. Here we show the first, to our knowledge, 3D protein structure calculated exclusively on the basis of information obtained in living cells. The structure of the putative heavy-metal binding protein TTHA1718 from Thermus thermophilus HB8 overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells was solved by in-cell NMR. Rapid measurement of the 3D NMR spectra by nonlinear sampling of the indirectly acquired dimensions was used to overcome problems caused by the instability and low sensitivity of living E. coli samples. Almost all of the expected backbone NMR resonances and most of the side-chain NMR resonances were observed and assigned, enabling high quality (0.96 angstrom backbone root mean squared deviation) structures to be calculated that are very similar to the in vitro structure of TTHA1718 determined independently. The in-cell NMR approach can thus provide accurate high-resolution structures of proteins in living environments.
In this article, we have described various detailed features of the conformation of yeast tRNA(Phe) revealed by recent refinement analysis of x-ray diffraction data at 2.5 A resolution. The gross features of the molecule observed in the unrefined version have been largely confirmed and a number of new features found. The unique role of the ribose 2' hydroxyl groups in maintaining a series of nonhelical conformations in this RNA molecule has become apparent. Many of these features are a direct consequence of the geometry of the ribose phosphate backbone of RNA molecules, and these may also be found in structured regions of other RNA species as well. Special attention has been directed toward two conformational motifs revealed by this analysis. These include the striking similarity between the TpsiC and anticodon hairpin turns in the polynucleotide chain, which are stabilized by the participation of uridine in the U turn. In addition, there is frequent occurrence of an arch conformation  in the polynucleotide chian which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds from 2' hydroxyl residues to phosphate groups across the base of the arch. The importance of the 2' hydroxyl interactions in defining tertiary structure is illustrated by the fact that, in the nonhelical regions, almost half of the ribose residues are involved in O2' hydrogen-bonding interactions which stabilize the conformation of the molecule.
Studies of a series of short oligonucleotide double and triple helices containing either all RNA, all DNA, or a mixture of the two show strand-dependent variation in their stability and structure. The variation in stability for both groups falls over a range of greater than 10 kilocalories per mole. In forming the triple helix, RNA is favored on both pyrimidine strands, whereas DNA is favored on the purine strand. In general, relatively unstable duplexes form particularly stable triplexes and vice versa. Structural data indicate that the strands in hybrid helices adopt a conformation that is intermediate between molecules containing all DNA and all RNA. Thus, RNA-DNA hybrids were not forced into the conformation of the RNA (A-form). The provocative stability of the triplex with an RNA third strand+DNA duplex points to novel antisense strategies and opens the possibility of an in vivo role of these structures. Overall, the data emphasize the fundamental role of sugars in determining the properties of nucleic acid complexes.
Transport of solutes across biological membranes is performed by specialized secondary transport proteins in the lipid bilayer, and is essential for life. Here we report the structures of the sodium-independent carnitine/butyrobetaine antiporter CaiT from Proteus mirabilis (PmCaiT) at 2.3-A and from Escherichia coli (EcCaiT) at 3.5-A resolution. CaiT belongs to the family of betaine/carnitine/choline transporters (BCCT), which are mostly Na(+) or H(+) dependent, whereas EcCaiT is Na(+) and H(+) independent. The three-dimensional architecture of CaiT resembles that of the Na(+)-dependent transporters LeuT and BetP, but in CaiT a methionine sulphur takes the place of the Na(+) ion to coordinate the substrate in the central transport site, accounting for Na(+)-independent transport. Both CaiT structures show the fully open, inward-facing conformation, and thus complete the set of functional states that describe the alternating access mechanism. EcCaiT contains two bound butyrobetaine substrate molecules, one in the central transport site, the other in an extracellular binding pocket. In the structure of PmCaiT, a tryptophan side chain occupies the transport site, and access to the extracellular site is blocked. Binding of both substrates to CaiT reconstituted into proteoliposomes is cooperative, with Hill coefficients up to 1.7, indicating that the extracellular site is regulatory. We propose a mechanism whereby the occupied regulatory site increases the binding affinity of the transport site and initiates substrate translocation.
Stimulation of preparations of rabbit olfactory epithelium with aqueous solutions containing the odorants linalool or inalyl isobutyrate, or both, initiates molecular changes that can be monitored by a specific decrease in absorbance at 267 nanometers. This change in absorbance appears to be associated with a change in macromolecular conformation which is initiated by formation of a complex involving the stimulant molecules.
The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) is a typical example of a multidomain protein, for which in vivo folding is assumed to occur vectorially from the amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus. Using a pulse-chase approach in intact cells, we found instead that newly synthesized LDL-R molecules folded by way of "collapsed" intermediates that contained non-native disulfide bonds between distant cysteines. The most amino-terminal domain acquired its native conformation late in folding instead of during synthesis. Thus, productive LDL-R folding in a cell is not vectorial but is mostly posttranslational, and involves transient long-range non-native disulfide bonds that are isomerized into native short-range cysteine pairs.
Antigenic variation in the haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein of influenza virus is associated with recurrent epidemics of respiratory disease in man (for review see ref. 1). We have examined the size of structural changes necessary to alter the antigenicity of HA by determining the three-dimensional structure of the HA from an antigenic mutant containing a single amino acid substitution which was selected by growth of virus in the presence of monoclonal antibodies. Here we present evidence that the simple addition of an amino acid side chain which results in only minor local distortions of the structure of the HA is sufficient structural alteration for a virus to escape neutralization by a monoclonal antibody. Our results also demonstrate that single amino acid substitutions can cause only local changes in the HA structure, verifying the assumption made in several studies to locate antigenic sites on the HA and other molecules, and indicate that proposals of large conformational changes to account for variations in HA antigenicity are unnecessary in this case. The structure of the variant antigen has independently been successfully predicted (M. Karplus, personal communication).
A detailed description of the interactions between an antibody and its epitope is necessary to allow an understanding of the way in which antibodies bind to antigenic surfaces presented by foreign molecules. Ideally this should be done by analysis of crystal structures of antibody-antigen complexes, but so far only two of these are available. An alternative strategy combines molecular modelling with site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) and using this we have generated a preliminary model of the complex between Gloop2, an antibody raised against a peptide containing the 'loop' determinant of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) which also binds the native protein, and its epitope on the protein surface. The main predictions from our model were; (1) that the surface of interaction between the antibody and the antigen is large (20 A X 15 A) and involves all the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), (2) that electrostatic interactions were important in the formation of the complex, and (3) that conformational changes in either the loop or in the CDRs may occur during the formation of the complex. Here we report SDM studies which test some of these predictions; removal of two charged residues at the periphery of the combining site increases the affinity of the antibody for its antigen over 8-fold and decreases its ability to cross-react with closely-related antigens. This result is at variance with our original prediction but can be accommodated within our newly refined model; the role of electrostatics in antigen-antibody interactions is now questionable.
Conformational transitions in polymers involve large angle rotations about bonds. The process must proceed in a way that does not require gross movements of the macromolecules. The dynamics have been investigated by computer simulation and kinetic theory. The rate-determining step in the transition is found to occur in a mode which is kept local by distortion of nearby parts of the molecule. One especially important type of cooperativity, crank-like counterrotation of second-neighbor bonds, is identified. Experiments which provide evidence about the dynamics of conformational transitions are discussed.
Cytochromes P450 (P450s) metabolize a wide range of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, such as pollutants, environmental compounds, and drug molecules. The microsomal, membrane-associated, P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2 are responsible for the oxidative metabolism of more than 90% of marketed drugs. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolizes more drug molecules than all other isoforms combined. Here we report three crystal structures of CYP3A4: unliganded, bound to the inhibitor metyrapone, and bound to the substrate progesterone. The structures revealed a surprisingly small active site, with little conformational change associated with the binding of either compound. An unexpected peripheral binding site is identified, located above a phenylalanine cluster, which may be involved in the initial recognition of substrates or allosteric effectors.
Compounds that stabilize the DNA binding domain of p53 in the active conformation were identified. These small synthetic molecules not only promoted the stability of wild-type p53 but also allowed mutant p53 to maintain an active conformation. A prototype compound caused the accumulation of conformationally active p53 in cells with mutant p53, enabling it to activate transcription and to slow tumor growth in mice. With further work aimed at improving potency, this class of compounds may be developed into anticancer drugs of broad utility.
Polymerization of actin filaments directed by the actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 complex supports many types of cellular movements. However, questions remain regarding the relative contributions of Arp2/3 complex versus other mechanisms of actin filament nucleation to processes such as path finding by neuronal growth cones; this is because of the lack of simple methods to inhibit Arp2/3 complex reversibly in living cells. Here we describe two classes of small molecules that bind to different sites on the Arp2/3 complex and inhibit its ability to nucleate actin filaments. CK-0944636 binds between Arp2 and Arp3, where it appears to block movement of Arp2 and Arp3 into their active conformation. CK-0993548 inserts into the hydrophobic core of Arp3 and alters its conformation. Both classes of compounds inhibit formation of actin filament comet tails by Listeria and podosomes by monocytes. Two inhibitors with different mechanisms of action provide a powerful approach for studying the Arp2/3 complex in living cells.
Crystal structures of heparin-derived tetra- and hexasaccharides complexed with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were determined at resolutions of 1.9 and 2.2 angstroms, respectively. The heparin structure may be approximated as a helical polymer with a disaccharide rotation of 174 degrees and a translation of 8.6 angstroms along the helix axis. Both molecules bound similarly to a region of the bFGF surface containing residues asparagine-28, arginine-121, lysine-126, and glutamine-135, the hexasaccharide also interacted with an additional binding site formed by lysine-27, asparagine-102, and lysine-136. No significant conformational change in bFGF occurred upon heparin oligosaccharide binding, which suggests that heparin primarily serves to juxtapose components of the FGF signal transduction pathway.
Antigen recognition by T lymphocytes is mediated by cell-surface glycoproteins known as T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs). These are composed of alpha and beta, or gamma and delta, polypeptide chains with variable (V) and constant (C) regions. In contrast to alphabeta TCRs, which recognize antigen only as peptide fragments bound to molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), gammadelta TCRs appear to recognize proteins directly, without antigen processing, and to recognize MHC molecules independently of the bound peptide. Moreover, small phosphate-containing non-peptide compounds have also been identified as ligands for certain gammadelta T cells. These studies indicate that antigen recognition by gammadelta TCRs may be fundamentally different from that by alphabeta TCRs. The three-dimensional structures of several alphabeta TCRs and TCR fragments, and their complexes with peptide-MHC or superantigens, have been determined. Here we report the crystal structure of the Vdelta domain of a human gammadelta TCR at 1.9 A resolution. A comparison with antibody and alphabeta TCR V domains reveals that the framework structure of Vdelta more closely resembles that of VH than of Valpha, Vbeta or VL (where H and L refer to heavy and light chains), whereas the relative positions and conformations of its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) share features of both Valpha and VH. These results provide the first direct evidence that gammadelta TCRs are structurally distinct from alphabeta TCRs and, together with the observation that the CDR3 length distribution of TCR delta chains is similar to that of immunoglobulin heavy chains, are consistent with functional studies suggesting that recognition of certain antigens by gammadelta TCRs may resemble antigen recognition by antibodies.
