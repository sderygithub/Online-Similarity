Classical genetic studies on the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum have been hampered by a complex life cycle which alternates between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Consequently, only a few genetic crosses have been performed so far. In addition, molecular genetics has provided only limited access to the genes of this pathogen, a consequence of an unusually high A + T content. To overcome these limitations we have constructed an ordered telomere-to-telomere contig map of P. falciparum chromosome 2 by isolating overlapping yeast artificial chromosome clones. This approach was used to examine the strain-dependent polymorphisms commonly observed for P. falciparum chromosomes. Our analysis reveals that polymorphisms of chromosome 2 are restricted to regions at either end, representing 20% of the chromosome. Transcription mapping of the entire chromosome suggests a compartmentalization of chromosome 2 into a transcribed central domain and silent polymorphic ends.
Even though the genetic fingerprint of human sperm has been defined, its role in orchestrating fertilization and the development of the early embryo remains vague. Here we show that human male gametes pass over more to the oocyte than just the haploid male genome--paternal messenger RNAs are also delivered to the egg at fertilization. If these transcripts, previously thought to be left-overs from spermatogenesis, are important in early development, our findings may have implications for the success of somatic-cell nuclear transfer in cloning technology and the identification of components leading to unexplained male-factor infertility.
The entire pathway for synthesis of the tyrosine-derived cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin has been transferred from Sorghum bicolor to Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we document that genetically engineered plants are able to synthesize and store large amounts of new natural products. The presence of dhurrin in the transgenic A. thaliana plants confers resistance to the flea beetle Phyllotreta nemorum, which is a natural pest of other members of the crucifer group, demonstrating the potential utility of cyanogenic glucosides in plant defense.
Recent progress in advanced nuclear power development in the United States is revealing high potential for nuclear reactor systems that are smaller and easier to operate than the present generation. Passive, or intrinsic, characteristics are applied not only to provide inherent stability of the chain reaction but also to ensure continued cooling of the fuel and its containment systems even if a major breakdown of the normal cooling and control functions were to occur. The chance of a severe accident is thereby substantially reduced. The plant designs that are emerging are simpler and more rugged, have a longer life span, and place less burden on equipment and operating personnel. Modular design concepts and design standardization are also used to reduce construction time and engineering costs, giving promise that the cost of generating power from these systems will be competitive with alternative methods.
The Drosophila Shaker gene on the X chromosome has three sister genes, Shal, Shab, and Shaw, which map to the second and third chromosomes. This extended gene family encodes voltage-gated potassium channels with widely varying kinetics (rate of macroscopic current activation and inactivation) and voltage sensitivity of steady-state inactivation. The differences in the currents of the various gene products are greater than the differences produced by alternative splicing of the Shaker gene. In Drosophila, the transient (A current) subtype of the potassium channel (Shaker and Shal) and the delayed-rectifier subtype (Shab and Shaw) are encoded by homologous genes, and there is more than one gene for each subtype of channel. Homologs of Shaker, Shal, Shab, and Shaw are present in mammals; each Drosophila potassium-channel gene may be represented as a multigene subfamily in mammals.
Sexual differentiation in placental mammals results from the action of a testis-determining gene encoded by the Y chromosome. This gene causes the indifferent gonad to develop as a testis, thereby initiating a hormonal cascade which produces a male phenotype. Recently, a candidate for the testis-determining gene (ZFY, Y-borne zinc-finger protein) has been cloned. The ZFY probe detects a male-specific (Y-linked) sequence in DNA from a range of eutherian mammals, as well as an X-linked sequence (ZFX) which maps to the human X chromosome. In marsupials it is also the Y chromosome that seems to determine the fate of the gonad, but not all sexual dimorphisms. Using the ZFY probe we find, surprisingly, that the ZFY homologous sequences are not on either the X or the Y chromosome in marsupials, but map to the autosomes. This implies ZFY is not the primary sex-determining gene in marsupials. Either the genetic pathways of sex determination in marsupials and eutherians differ, or they are identical and ZFY is not the primary signal in human sex determination.
Little is known about the signaling mechanisms that determine the highly regular patterning of the intestinal epithelium into crypts and villi. With the use of mouse models, we show that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 expression occurs exclusively in the intravillus mesenchyme. Villus epithelial cells respond to the BMP signal. Inhibition of BMP signaling by transgenic expression of noggin results in the formation of numerous ectopic crypt units perpendicular to the crypt-villus axis. These changes phenocopy the intestinal histopathology of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome juvenile polyposis (JP), including the frequent occurrence of intraepithelial neoplasia. Many JP cases are known to harbor mutations in BMP pathway genes. These data indicate that intestinal BMP signaling represses de novo crypt formation and polyp growth.
Understanding the genetic basis of the physical and behavioural traits that distinguish humans from other primates presents one of the great new challenges in biology. Of the millions of base-pair differences between humans and chimpanzees, which particular changes contributed to the evolution of human features after the separation of the Pan and Homo lineages 5-7 million years ago? How can we identify the 'smoking guns' of human genetic evolution from neutral ticks of the molecular evolutionary clock? The magnitude and rate of morphological evolution in hominids suggests that many independent and incremental developmental changes have occurred that, on the basis of recent findings in model animals, are expected to be polygenic and regulatory in nature. Comparative genomics, population genetics, gene-expression analyses and medical genetics have begun to make complementary inroads into the complex genetic architecture of human evolution.
The purification, renewal and differentiation of native cardiac progenitors would form a mechanistic underpinning for unravelling steps for cardiac cell lineage formation, and their links to forms of congenital and adult cardiac diseases. Until now there has been little evidence for native cardiac precursor cells in the postnatal heart. Herein, we report the identification of isl1+ cardiac progenitors in postnatal rat, mouse and human myocardium. A cardiac mesenchymal feeder layer allows renewal of the isolated progenitor cells with maintenance of their capability to adopt a fully differentiated cardiomyocyte phenotype. Tamoxifen-inducible Cre/lox technology enables selective marking of this progenitor cell population including its progeny, at a defined time, and purification to relative homogeneity. Co-culture studies with neonatal myocytes indicate that isl1+ cells represent authentic, endogenous cardiac progenitors (cardioblasts) that display highly efficient conversion to a mature cardiac phenotype with stable expression of myocytic markers (25%) in the absence of cell fusion, intact Ca2+-cycling, and the generation of action potentials. The discovery of native cardioblasts represents a genetically based system to identify steps in cardiac cell lineage formation and maturation in development and disease.
A four-ring tripeptide containing alternating imidazole and pyrrole carboxamides specifically binds six-base pair 5'-(A,T)GCGC(A,T)-3' sites in the minor groove of DNA. The designed peptide has a specificity completely reversed from that of the tripyrrole distamycin, which binds A,T sequences. Structural studies with nuclear magnetic resonance revealed that two peptides bound side-by-side and in an antiparallel orientation in the minor groove. Each of the four imidazoles in the 2:1 ligand-DNA complex recognized a specific guanine amino group in the GCGC core through a hydrogen bond. Targeting a designated four-base pair G.C tract by this synthetic ligand supports the generality of the 2:1 peptide-DNA motif for sequence-specific minor groove recognition of DNA.
T cells that express the T cell receptor V beta 5.2 domain react with the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule I-E, and V beta 5.2+ T cells are deleted in mouse strains that express I-E glycoproteins. By examination of genetically defined recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains, it was found that the deletion was dependent on the expression of I-E and one of a limited number of non-MHC gene products (cotolerogens). The gene encoding one of these cotolerogens maps to chromosome 12 and is linked to the endogenous provirus Mtv-9. These observations suggest that the I-E-mediated and minor lymphocyte-stimulating antigen (Mls)-mediated deletions of alpha beta T cells from the repertoire are similar; both require the expression of a class II MHC glycoprotein and a second non-MHC gene product.
One approach to drug design involves determination of the structure of binding sites on target proteins to provide templates for ligand construction. Alternatively, random combinations of chemical groups can be used to generate diverse molecules for screening in the search for effective compounds. Here we report a strategy for developing potent ligands for proteins with multiple binding sites, which combines elements of both approaches: 'polymer-linked ligand dimers', in which two ligands are joined by a polymer chain of variable length. We find that polymer-linked ligand dimers containing two cyclic GMP moieties are up to a thousand times more potent than cyclic GMP in activating cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Each target protein responds optimally to a polymer-linked ligand dimer with a different average polymer length, even though their cyclic-nucleotide-binding sites are conserved. The tuning of polymer-linked ligand dimers indicates that each protein has a unique spacing of binding sites and provides an estimate of the distance between these sites. As optimal ligands are selected empirically, the polymer-linked ligand dimer strategy enables potent and selective agents to be identified without requiring previous structural information about the target proteins.
Cell cultures of crop plants provide new opportunities to recover induced mutations likely to increase crop yield. Approaches include regulating respiration to conserve carbon fixed by photosynthesis, and increasing the nutritive value of seed protein. They depend on devising selecting conditions which only desired mutant cells can survive. Protoplast fusion offers some promise of tapping sources of genetic variation now unavailable because of sterility barriers between species and genera. Difficulties in regenerating cell lines from protoplasts, and plants from cells, still hamper progress but are becoming less severe. Recombinant DNA techniques may allow detection and selection of bacterial cell lines carrying specific DNA sequences. Isolation and amplification of crop plant genes could then lead to ways of transforming plants that will be useful to breeders.
The Perigord black truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vittad.) and the Piedmont white truffle dominate today's truffle market. The hypogeous fruiting body of T. melanosporum is a gastronomic delicacy produced by an ectomycorrhizal symbiont endemic to calcareous soils in southern Europe. The worldwide demand for this truffle has fuelled intense efforts at cultivation. Identification of processes that condition and trigger fruit body and symbiosis formation, ultimately leading to efficient crop production, will be facilitated by a thorough analysis of truffle genomic traits. In the ectomycorrhizal Laccaria bicolor, the expansion of gene families may have acted as a 'symbiosis toolbox'. This feature may however reflect evolution of this particular taxon and not a general trait shared by all ectomycorrhizal species. To get a better understanding of the biology and evolution of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, we report here the sequence of the haploid genome of T. melanosporum, which at approximately 125 megabases is the largest and most complex fungal genome sequenced so far. This expansion results from a proliferation of transposable elements accounting for approximately 58% of the genome. In contrast, this genome only contains approximately 7,500 protein-coding genes with very rare multigene families. It lacks large sets of carbohydrate cleaving enzymes, but a few of them involved in degradation of plant cell walls are induced in symbiotic tissues. The latter feature and the upregulation of genes encoding for lipases and multicopper oxidases suggest that T. melanosporum degrades its host cell walls during colonization. Symbiosis induces an increased expression of carbohydrate and amino acid transporters in both L. bicolor and T. melanosporum, but the comparison of genomic traits in the two ectomycorrhizal fungi showed that genetic predispositions for symbiosis-'the symbiosis toolbox'-evolved along different ways in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.
Aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases establish the rules of the genetic code by catalyzing the aminoacylation of tRNAs. For some synthetases, accuracy depends critically on an editing function at a site distinct from the aminoacylation site. Mutants of Escherichia coli that incorrectly charge tRNA(Val) with cysteine were selected after random mutagenesis of the whole chromosome. All mutations obtained were located in the editing site of valyl-tRNA synthetase. More than 20% of the valine in cellular proteins from such an editing mutant organism could be replaced with the noncanonical aminobutyrate, sterically similar to cysteine. Thus, the editing function may have played a central role in restricting the genetic code to 20 amino acids. Disabling this editing function offers a powerful approach for diversifying the chemical composition of proteins and for emulating evolutionary stages of ambiguous translation.
The human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) is an exogenous retrovirus which has been associated with adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL). This malignancy of T lymphocytes is endemic to southern Japan, the West Indies, and to a lesser extent, the Middle East, Central Africa and the southeastern United States. ATL cells from patients of diverse geographical origins have been found to be infected with HTLV-1 (ref.6). HTLV is normally tropic for mature T lymphocytes, especially those expressing the helper-inducer surface antigen phenotype (OKT4 or Leu-3-positive), and the neoplastic T cells infected with HTLV generally express receptors for T-cell growth factor (detected by reactivity with anti-Tac antibody). However, we report here the isolation of a HTLV-infected B-lymphocyte clone from the peripheral blood of a patient with ATL. This clone is cytogenetically normal and is not infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Co-culture of cells from this clone with cord blood lymphocytes resulted in transmission of HTLV and the immortalization of either T or B lymphocytes. These results suggest that HTLV may be associated with a broader range of host cells than previously recognized.
The link between H chondrites and silicate inclusions in group IIE iron meteorites has long been suspected, but direct evidence for a common parentage has remained elusive. The discovery of an unmelted chondritic inclusion in the Techado iron meteorite sheds light on the genetic relation between these two groups, providing clues on the origin of chondritic materials as inclusions in iron meteorites. It is proposed that the complex IIE iron meteorite breccias formed by collisions with several different bodies, followed by deep burial of metal and silicate fragments in the asteroidal megaregolith.
Transgenic mice were created to assess genetic linkage between Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and a leucine substitution at codon 102 of the human prion protein gene. Spontaneous neurologic disease with spongiform degeneration and gliosis similar to that in mouse scrapie developed at a mean age of 166 days in 35 mice expressing mouse prion protein with the leucine substitution. Thus, many of the clinical and pathological features of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome are reproduced in transgenic mice containing a prion protein with a single amino acid substitution, illustrating that a neurodegenerative process similar to a human disease can be genetically modeled in animals.
A biochemical polymorphism of coelomic hemerythrin has been found in the sipunculid Golfingia gouldii; the electrophoretically "fast" and "slow" coelomic hemerythrins differ in their oxygen equilibria and by a single peptide in tryptic and chymotryptic "fingerprints." All individuals of this sipunculid have the same vascular hemerythrin, which is electrophoretically different from any of the coelomic hemerythrins. Vascular and coelomic hemerythrins of another sipunculid, Dendrostomum cymodoceae, have quite different "fingerprints." Thus, on the basis of two separate types of evidence the tissue-specific hemerythrins appear to have a distinct genetic basis. The embryological and phylogenetic implications are discussed.
Signal transduction by beta-catenin involves its posttranslational stabilization and downstream coupling to the Lef and Tcf transcription factors. Abnormally high amounts of beta-catenin were detected in 7 of 26 human melanoma cell lines. Unusual messenger RNA splicing and missense mutations in the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) that result in stabilization of the protein were identified in six of the lines, and the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein (APC) was altered or missing in two others. In the APC-deficient cells, ectopic expression of wild-type APC eliminated the excess beta-catenin. Cells with stabilized beta-catenin contained a constitutive beta-catenin-Lef-1 complex. Thus, genetic defects that result in up-regulation of beta-catenin may play a role in melanoma progression.
A substitution of alanine for valine at position 126 in the beta-chain of hemoglobin was discovered in a hematologically normal adult male of Lebanese extraction. The variant beta-globin was initially observed and subsequently purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Reverse-phase HPLC was also used to isolate the variant tryptic peptide of beta-T13 that has alanine replacing valine at residue 126. The discovery of hemoglobin Beirut illustrates the usefulness of reverse-phase HPLC for the detection of neutral amino acid substitutions in proteins. The ability to detect neutral substitutions in undigested proteins is pertinent to the monitoring of genetic variation in human populations.
There is increasing evidence that retinoic acid is a morphogen involved in vertebrate development. This evidence comes in part from studies of the chick wing bud, in which local application of all-trans-retinoic acid results in a duplication of the digit pattern along the anteroposterior axis. Retinoic acid may be only one of several morphogenetic signalling compounds required for limb pattern formation. To identify novel morphogenetically active compounds, fractionated extracts of whole chick embryos were tested for their ability to induce digit pattern duplications. We describe here the isolation of a new activity present in the limb bud, which we have identified as all-trans-3,4-didehydroretinoic acid. The 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid is generated in situ from retinol through a 3,4-didehydroretinol intermediate. We show that 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid and retinoic acid are equipotent in evoking digit duplications. These findings suggest that there are at least two endogenous retinoids with morphogenetic properties in the chick limb.
Crown-group crustaceans (Eucrustacea) are common in the fossil record of the past 500 million years back to the early Ordovician period, and very rare representatives are also known from the late Middle and Late Cambrian periods. Finds in Lower Cambrian rocks of the Phosphatocopina, the fossil sister group to eucrustaceans, imply that members of the eucrustacean stem lineage co-occurred, but it remained unclear whether crown-group members were also present at that time. 'Orsten'-type fossils are typically tiny embryos and cuticle-bearing animals, of which the cuticle is phosphatized and the material is three-dimensional and complete with soft parts. Such fossils are found predominantly in the Cambrian and Ordovician and provide detailed morphological and phylogenetic information on the early evolution of metazoans. Here we report an Orsten-type Konservat-Lagerstatte from the Lower Cambrian of China that contains at least three new arthropod species, of which we describe the most abundant form on the basis of exceptionally well preserved material of several growth stages. The limb morphology and other details of this new species are markedly similar to those of living cephalocarids, branchiopods and copepods and it is assigned to the Eucrustacea, thus representing the first undoubted crown-group crustacean from the early Cambrian. Its stratigraphical position provides substantial support to the proposition that the main cladogenic event that gave rise to the Arthropoda was before the Cambrian. Small leaf-shaped structures on the outer limb base of the new species provide evidence on the long-debated issue of the origin of epipodites: they occur in a set of three, derive from setae and are a ground-pattern feature of Eucrustacea.
Every cell contains many families of protein kinases, and may express several structurally related yet genetically distinct kinases of each family. The activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes has long been implicated in T-cell activation, but it is not known which members of the PKC family regulate the T-cell response to foreign antigens. The activation of T cells by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is spatially restricted to their site of contact, where receptors on the T cells engage their counter-receptors on the APCs. We used this localized engagement to identify, at the single-cell level, intracellular proteins involved in the activation process. By digital immunofluorescence microscopy, we localized six isoforms of PKC in antigen-specific T-cell clones activated by APCs. Surprisingly, only PKC-theta translocated to the site of cell contact. Accordingly, in vitro kinase activity assays of PKC immunoprecipitates from the conjugates of T cells and APCs showed a selective increase in the activity of PKC-theta, indicating that the translocated enzyme is active. Several modes of partial T-cell activation that failed to cause PKC-theta translocation also failed to cause T-cell proliferation, further suggesting the involvement of PKC-theta in T-cell activation.
The independent evolution of morphological similarities is widespread. For simple traits, such as overall body colour, repeated transitions by means of mutations in the same gene may be common. However, for more complex traits, the possible genetic paths may be more numerous; the molecular mechanisms underlying their independent origins and the extent to which they are constrained to follow certain genetic paths are largely unknown. Here we show that a male wing pigmentation pattern involved in courtship display has been gained and lost multiple times in a Drosophila clade. Each of the cases we have analysed (two gains and two losses) involved regulatory changes at the pleiotropic pigmentation gene yellow. Losses involved the parallel inactivation of the same cis-regulatory element (CRE), with changes at a few nucleotides sufficient to account for the functional divergence of one element between two sibling species. Surprisingly, two independent gains of wing spots resulted from the co-option of distinct ancestral CREs. These results demonstrate how the functional diversification of the modular CREs of pleiotropic genes contributes to evolutionary novelty and the independent evolution of morphological similarities.
Mutations in the mouse diabetes (db) gene result in obesity and diabetes in a syndrome resembling morbid human obesity. Previous data suggest that the db gene encodes the receptor for the obese (ob) gene product, leptin. A leptin receptor was recently cloned from choroid plexus and shown to map to the same 6-cM interval on mouse chromosome 4 as db. This receptor maps to the same 300-kilobase interval as db, and has at least six alternatively spliced forms. One of these splice variants is expressed at a high level in the hypothalamus, and is abnormally spliced in C57BL/Ks db/db mice. The mutant protein is missing the cytoplasmic region, and is likely to be defective in signal transduction. This suggests that the weight-reducing effects of leptin may be mediated by signal transduction through a leptin receptor in the hypothalamus.
Three genetic complementation groups of rodent cells are defective for both repair of x-ray-induced double-strand breaks and V(D)J recombination. Cells from one group lack a DNA end-binding activity that is biochemically and antigenically similar to the Ku autoantigen. Transfection of complementary DNA (cDNA) that encoded the 86-kilodalton subunit of Ku rescued these mutant cells for DNA end-binding activity, x-ray resistance, and V(D)J recombination activity. These results establish a role for Ku in DNA repair and recombination. Furthermore, as a component of a DNA-dependent protein kinase, Ku may initiate a signaling pathway induced by DNA damage.
The ratite moa (Aves; Dinornithiformes) were massive graviportal browsers weighing up to 250 kg (ref. 1) that dominated the New Zealand biota until their extinction approximately 500 yr ago. Despite an extensive Quaternary fossil record, moa taxonomy remains problematic and currently 11 species are recognized. Three Dinornis species were found throughout New Zealand and differed markedly in size (1-2 m height at back) and mass (from approximately 34 to 242 kg). Surprisingly, ancient mitochondrial DNA sequences show that the three species were genetically indistinguishable within each island, but formed separate North and South Island clades. Here we show, using the first sex-linked nuclear sequences from an extinct species, that on each island the three morphological forms actually represent just one species, whose size varied markedly according to sex and habitat. The largest females in this example of extreme reversed sexual size dimorphism were about 280% the weight and 150% the height of the largest males, which is unprecedented among birds and terrestrial mammals. The combination of molecular and palaeontological data highlights the difficulties of analysing extinct groups, even those with detailed fossil records.
A team of researchers has come up with a novel atomic imaging microscope that may dramatically speed the task of linking genetic variants to diseases. The microscope is a modification of the popular atomic force microscope (AFM), which uses an ultrasharp tip to map surfaces of everything from computer chips to DNA at the atomic level. By using this molecule-sized tip, the researchers were able get their AFM to march down a strand of DNA and identify uniquely shaped reporter molecules engineered to tag the genetic variations.
Class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) consist of a family of closely related cell surface-expressed glycoproteins. These antigens, which are genetically polymorphic, control important aspects of the immune response. At least three types of human class II antigens, namely, DR, DC and SB (refs 2-4), have been identified. All class II antigens are heterodimers composed of one alpha- and one beta-chain. The genes for both types of subunits are encompassed within the MHC. The general features of the DC and DR antigens have recently been elucidated. Much less is known, however, about the SB molecules. Here we describe the isolation of a cDNA clone as well as a genomic clone encoding a beta-chain whose amino acid sequence is compatible with the partial amino-terminal sequence of SB beta-chains.
A prominent feature of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases is accumulation of misfolded protein in vulnerable neurons. When levels of misfolded protein overwhelm degradative pathways, the result is cellular toxicity and neurodegeneration. Cellular mechanisms for degrading misfolded protein include the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the main non-lysosomal degradative pathway for ubiquitinated proteins, and autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradative pathway. The UPS and autophagy have long been viewed as complementary degradation systems with no point of intersection. This view has been challenged by two observations suggesting an apparent interaction: impairment of the UPS induces autophagy in vitro, and conditional knockout of autophagy in the mouse brain leads to neurodegeneration with ubiquitin-positive pathology. It is not known whether autophagy is strictly a parallel degradation system, or whether it is a compensatory degradation system when the UPS is impaired; furthermore, if there is a compensatory interaction between these systems, the molecular link is not known. Here we show that autophagy acts as a compensatory degradation system when the UPS is impaired in Drosophila melanogaster, and that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a microtubule-associated deacetylase that interacts with polyubiquitinated proteins, is an essential mechanistic link in this compensatory interaction. We found that compensatory autophagy was induced in response to mutations affecting the proteasome and in response to UPS impairment in a fly model of the neurodegenerative disease spinobulbar muscular atrophy. Autophagy compensated for impaired UPS function in an HDAC6-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression of HDAC6 was sufficient to rescue degeneration associated with UPS dysfunction in vivo in an autophagy-dependent manner. This study suggests that impairment of autophagy (for example, associated with ageing or genetic variation) might predispose to neurodegeneration. Morover, these findings suggest that it may be possible to intervene in neurodegeneration by augmenting HDAC6 to enhance autophagy.
Multiple genetic loci for induction of murine leukemia viruses are demonstrated in cells of the high leukemic incidence C58 mouse strain. The biologic properties of viruses at C58 inducibility loci are clearly distinguishable from those of viruses activated from mouse cells containing a locus for virus induction of the low leukemia incidence BALB/c strain. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the genes for virus induction in normal mouse embryo cells represent viral structural information.
The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria is a phenomenon of concern to the clinician and the pharmaceutical industry, as it is the major cause of failure in the treatment of infectious diseases. The most common mechanism of resistance in pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics of the aminoglycoside, beta-lactam (penicillins and cephalosporins), and chloramphenicol types involves the enzymic inactivation of the antibiotic by hydrolysis or by formation of inactive derivatives. Such resistance determinants most probably were acquired by pathogenic bacteria from a pool of resistance genes in other microbial genera, including antibiotic-producing organisms. The resistance gene sequences were subsequently integrated by site-specific recombination into several classes of naturally occurring gene expression cassettes (typically "integrons") and disseminated within the microbial population by a variety of gene transfer mechanisms. Although bacterial conjugation once was believed to be restricted in host range, it now appears that this mechanism of transfer permits genetic exchange between many different bacterial genera in nature.
Phylogenetic analysis with x-ray computed tomography of fossilized and recent crania implicates differential growth of the neocortex in the evolution and development of the mammalian middle ear. In premammalian tetrapods, the middle ear evolved as a chain of bones attached to the mandible and cranium, but in adult mammals the chain is detached from the mandible and lies behind it. The neocortex evolved concurrently with detachment of the chain. In mammalian development the auditory chain arises connected to the mandible but later detaches, recapitulating the phylogenetic transformation. In modern didelphid development, the auditory chain reaches mature size by the third week after birth and is then separated from the jaw and displaced caudally as the neocortex grows for another 9 weeks.
Analyses of the lipids in five species of blue-green algae show that the fatty acids are largely the C(16) and C(18) acids. The only alga that could be grown heterotrophically, Chlorogloea, formed the triply unsaturated C(18) acid in the light but only the doubly unsaturated C(18) acid in the dark. Examination of these results and the results of others suggest that, except for one species, the more highly unsaturated acids are found in the morphologically more complex algae. The fatty acid compositions of blue-green algae are different from the fatty acid composition of the other prokaryotic organisms, the bacteria. It is speculated that the diversity of the patterns of fatty acid composition among the blue-green algae could be of phylogenetic significance.
Niche conservatism--the tendency for closely related species to be ecologically similar--is widespread. However, most studies compare closely related taxa that occur in allopatry; in sympatry, the stabilizing forces that promote niche conservatism, and thus inhibit niche shifts, may be countered by natural selection favouring ecological divergence to minimize the intensity of interspecific interactions. Consequently, the relative importance of niche conservatism versus niche divergence in determining community structure has received little attention. Here, we examine a tropical lizard community in which species have a long evolutionary history of ecological interaction. We find that evolutionary divergence overcomes niche conservatism: closely related species are no more ecologically similar than expected by random divergence and some distantly related species are ecologically similar, leading to a community in which the relationship between ecological similarity and phylogenetic relatedness is very weak. Despite this lack of niche conservatism, the ecological structuring of the community has a phylogenetic component: niche complementarity only occurs among distantly related species, which suggests that the strength of ecological interactions among species may be related to phylogeny, but it is not necessarily the most closely related species that interact most strongly.
Fertilization of mammalian eggs is followed by successive cell divisions and progressive differentiation, first into the early embryo and subsequently into all of the cell types that make up the adult animal. Transfer of a single nucleus at a specific stage of development, to an enucleated unfertilized egg, provided an opportunity to investigate whether cellular differentiation to that stage involved irreversible genetic modification. The first offspring to develop from a differentiated cell were born after nuclear transfer from an embryo-derived cell line that had been induced to become quiescent. Using the same procedure, we now report the birth of live lambs from three new cell populations established from adult mammary gland, fetus and embryo. The fact that a lamb was derived from an adult cell confirms that differentiation of that cell did not involve the irreversible modification of genetic material required for development to term. The birth of lambs from differentiated fetal and adult cells also reinforces previous speculation that by inducing donor cells to become quiescent it will be possible to obtain normal development from a wide variety of differentiated cells.
Variability in the phenotype of cells comprising individual tumours is a striking feature of animal and human cancer and is generally referred to as tumour heterogeneity. Studies of clonally derived cell populations from tumours that originated presumably from a single transformed cell have shown that tumours are made up of cells that differ in a variety of traits, including drug resistance, antigen expression and metastatic potential. The origin and maintenance of tumour heterogeneity are unclear, but mutational and epigenetic mechanisms are thought to be involved. Here we report the results of a search for transforming genes in human melanoma which have raised the possibility that ras gene activation follows the same variable pattern as other traits involved in tumour heterogeneity. DNA from 4 of 30 melanoma cell lines yielded transforming ras genes in the NIH/3T3 assay. Of five cell lines originating from separate metastatic deposits of a single patient, only one contained activated ras, indicating heterogeneity in ras activation in this case and suggesting that ras activation was not involved in tumour initiation or maintenance in this patient.
Macroscopic quantities of the metallo-carbohedrenes TI(8)C(12) and V(8)C(12) have been synthesized with an arc discharge technique. Mass spectroscopy of raw soot samples generated in both an alternating and direct current arc between two metal-graphite powder composite electrodes establishes that the titanium and vanadium analogs of the metallo-carbohedrenes have been produced. An estimated yield of approximately 1 percent is obtained, and significantly, the products are stable in air.
The ocean is an electrically conducting fluid that generates secondary magnetic fields as it flows through Earth's main magnetic field. Extracting ocean flow signals from remote observations has become possible with the current generation of satellites measuring Earth's magnetic field. Here, we consider the magnetic fields generated by the ocean lunar semidiurnal (M2) tide and demonstrate that magnetic fields of oceanic origin can be clearly identified in satellite observations.
Cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal genetic disease in Caucasians, is characterized by a decreased permeability in sweat gland duct and airway epithelia. In sweat duct epithelium, a decreased Cl- permeability accounts for the abnormally increased salt content of sweat. In airway epithelia a decreased Cl- permeability, and possibly increased sodium absorption, may account for the abnormal respiratory tract fluid. The Cl- impermeability has been localized to the apical membrane of cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells. The finding that hormonally regulated Cl- channels make the apical membrane Cl- permeable in normal airway epithelial cells suggested abnormal Cl- channel function in cystic fibrosis. Here we report that excised, cell-free patches of membrane from cystic fibrosis epithelial cells contain Cl- channels that have the same conductive properties as Cl- channels from normal cells. However, Cl- channels from cystic fibrosis cells did not open when they were attached to the cell. These findings suggest defective regulation of Cl- channels in cystic fibrosis epithelia; to begin to address this issue, we performed two studies. First, we found that isoprenaline, which stimulates Cl- secretion, increases cellular levels of cyclic AMP in a similar manner in cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis epithelial cells. Second, we show that adrenergic agonists open calcium-activated potassium channels, indirectly suggesting that calcium-dependent stimulus-response coupling is intact in cystic fibrosis. These data suggest defective regulation of Cl- channels at a site distal to cAMP accumulation.
Experiments with sands chemically similar to graywackes produced "matrix" minerals at 250 degrees C and a water pressure of 1 kilobar. Starting materials were moderately well sorted sands containing abundant volcanic rock fragments and no detectable clay minerals. The results support the concept that graywacke matrix may form diagenetically by hydration and recrystallization of unstable clasts. Matrix need not be a recrystallized detrial fine fraction. Texture, therefore, is not a reliable criterion for sandstone classification. For graywackes, chemical composition may be more significant.
In 1953 Medawar pointed out that survival of the genetically disparate (allogeneic) mammalian conceptus contradicts the laws of tissue transplantation. Rapid T cell-induced rejection of all allogeneic concepti occurred when pregnant mice were treated with a pharmacologic inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme expressed by trophoblasts and macrophages. Thus, by catabolizing tryptophan, the mammalian conceptus suppresses T cell activity and defends itself against rejection.
Genetic surveys reveal the diversity of bacteria and lead to the questioning of species concepts used to categorize bacteria. One difficulty in defining bacterial species arises from the high rates of recombination that results in the transfer of DNA between relatively distantly related bacteria. Barriers to this process, which could be used to define species naturally, are not apparent. Here, we review conceptual models of bacterial speciation and describe our computer simulations of speciation. Our findings suggest that the rate of recombination and its relation to genetic divergence have a strong influence on outcomes. We propose that a distinction be made between clonal divergence and sexual speciation. Hence, to make sense of bacterial diversity, we need data not only from genetic surveys but also from experimental determination of selection pressures and recombination rates and from theoretical models.
The established mouse cell line NIH 3T3 has been used with considerable success over the past three years as the basis of an in vitro transformation assay for demonstrating the presence of transfectable transforming genes in the DNA of certain human and rodent tumour cells (for review see ref. 1). In the case of the human bladder carcinoma cell lines EJ and T24, this approach has led to the molecular cloning of a transforming gene which is closely related to the rat-derived Harvey sarcoma virus oncogene, v-Ha-ras. A single point mutation, which distinguishes these genes from their normal human homologue (c-Ha-ras1), is thought to be solely responsible for their transforming potential. However, carcinogenesis in both humans and laboratory rodents is a multi-stage process (reviewed in ref. 11) of which the NIH 3T3 cell, already partly transformed, may represent only the penultimate stage. We therefore chose to examine the transforming effects of the EJ oncogene in a hamster fibroblast system originally developed in our laboratory to study stages in carcinogen-induced malignant transformation of normal diploid cells. We show here that EJ c-Ha-ras-1 lacks complete transforming activity when transfected into normal fibroblasts which have a limited lifespan, but can fully transform fibroblasts that have been newly 'immortalized' by carcinogens.
Since the formation of COMSAT 20 years ago, the number of international telephone circuits made through satellites has grown 400 times and the cost of a telephone call has decreased by 12,000 percent. Worldwide communications linking 109 nations are achieved with 14 satellites in earth-synchronous orbit. Advances in microwave technology have expanded the transmission bandwidth per satellite from 50 to more than 3000 megahertz. Improvements in solar cell, battery, stationkeeping, and microwave amplification technology have increased satellite lifetime from 1.5 years to 10. The sixth generation of INTELSAT satellites, now being manufactured, will be introduced into the system in 1986, and each satellite will carry more than 40,000 telephone channels plus two television programs. The next generation of satellites, now under design for expanded capacity, will be needed by the middle 1990's to meet the traffic demand. These satellites are likely to add new frequencies (20 and 30 gigahertz), onboard signal processing and switching, and more bandwidth-efficient modulation, to achieve larger communication capacity at each orbital location.
Strong evidence for a genetic basis of variation in physical performance has accumulated. Considering one of the basic tenets of evolutionary physiology--that physical performance and darwinian fitness are tightly linked--one may expect phenotypes with exceptional physiological capacities to be promoted by natural selection. Why then does physical performance remain considerably variable in human and other animal populations? Our analysis of locomotor performance in the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) demonstrates that initial endurance (running time to exhaustion measured at birth) is indeed highly heritable, but natural selection in favour of this trait can be unexpectedly weak. A manipulation of dietary conditions unravels a proximate mechanism explaining this pattern. Fully fed individuals experience a marked reversal of performance within only one month after birth: juveniles with low endurance catch up, whereas individuals with high endurance lose their advantage. In contrast, dietary restriction allows highly endurant neonates to retain their locomotor superiority as they age. Thus, the expression of a genetic predisposition to high physical performance strongly depends on the environment experienced early in life.
Bacterial pathogens frequently use protein secretion to mediate interactions with their hosts. Here we found that a virulence locus (HSI-I) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes a protein secretion apparatus. The apparatus assembled in discrete subcellular locations and exported Hcp1, a hexameric protein that forms rings with a 40 angstrom internal diameter. Regulatory patterns of HSI-I suggested that the apparatus functions during chronic infections. We detected Hcp1 in pulmonary secretions of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and Hcp1-specific antibodies in their sera. Thus, HSI-I likely contributes to the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa in CF patients. HSI-I-related loci are widely distributed among bacterial pathogens and may play a general role in mediating host interactions.
Five kappa chains in the urinary proteins of the BALB/c mouse have the same carboxyl terminal amino acid sequence; this sequence resembles that of kappa light chains in human immunoglobulins. The five chains have amino acid sequence variations at the amino- terminal. The genetic basis for the amino- terminal variations is not understood but could be due either to a mecha nism for differently translating a single genetic message or to the presence of more than one kappa- type structural cistron in the BALB/c genome.
Logarithmic distributions of nucleic acid contents per genome of species within major phylogenetic groups of organisms tend to form several peaks. These peaks appear to represent intragroup doublings of DNA or RNA which, in the case of eukaryotes, are independent of polyploidy. This phenomenon has been termed cryptopolyploidy. There are numerical similarities in peak values for different taxonomic groups. A high degree of order is suggested when minimum values for the major phylogenetic groups are plotted against a series of theoretical doublings. These data demonstrate the apparent existence of an exponential periodicity over eight orders of magnitude, leading us to suggest an evolutionary continuity of doublings of a basic ancestral genome (of about 300 nucleotides), these doublings being independent of both chromosome number and ploidy level. This proposed continuity encompasses most major life forms and is generally concomitant with increasing evolutionary complexity, particularly in the prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. Our interpretation of the data presented here must currently be viewed as speculative, and we do not propose that genome doubling is the only mechanism for genome evolution. However, we feel that the evidence is sufficient to warrant serious scrutiny of our proposals. We hope that this approach to a synthesis of available data will provoke discussion and will stimulate further work toward either supporting, modifying, or disproving our hypothesis.
Mitotic recombination within the beta-galactosidase gene was followed in F' merodiploids grown in the presence and absence of inducer. Inducer inhibited recombination when the two mutations in the merodiploid were nonpolar but had no effect when the mutations were strongly polar. These results are interpreted to mean that transcription inhibits intragenic mitotic recombination and that strongly polar mutations inhibit transcription.
In genetic studies of C57BL/10 and BALB/c mice, inducibility of xenotropic murine leukemia virus from tissue cultures by treatment with 5-iododeoxyuridine shows single gene segregation ratios. In both strains, the virus-inducing loci are on chromosome 1, linked to the Dip-1/isozyme locus, but the two may not be at allelic sites.
To study basic principles of transcriptome organization in bacteria, we analyzed one of the smallest self-replicating organisms, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We combined strand-specific tiling arrays, complemented by transcriptome sequencing, with more than 252 spotted arrays. We detected 117 previously undescribed, mostly noncoding transcripts, 89 of them in antisense configuration to known genes. We identified 341 operons, of which 139 are polycistronic; almost half of the latter show decaying expression in a staircase-like manner. Under various conditions, operons could be divided into 447 smaller transcriptional units, resulting in many alternative transcripts. Frequent antisense transcripts, alternative transcripts, and multiple regulators per gene imply a highly dynamic transcriptome, more similar to that of eukaryotes than previously thought.
A total of 175 skin grafts were transplanted among 20 individuals belonging to two separate populations of the parthenogenetic lizard Cnemidophorus uniparens. Of these, 98.8 percent were permanently accepted, which indicates that all individuals of each population may be genetically identical. These results further suggest that large populations or the entire species may consist of one clone derived from a single individual.
C(3)H mice, made chimeric by lethal x-irradiation followed by injection of (C(3)H x T(6))F(1) spleen cells, were later stimulated by CCl(4) to produce a vigorous burst of hepatic parenchymal cell mitoses. Cytogenetic studies of the regenerating livers of 11 chimeras identified 89 percent of the cells as donor type by the presence of the distinctive T(6) marker.
The early evolutionary history of Ornithodira (avian-line archosaurs) has hitherto been documented by incomplete (Lagerpeton) or unusually specialized forms (pterosaurs and Silesaurus). Recently, a variety of Silesaurus-like taxa have been reported from the Triassic period of both Gondwana and Laurasia, but their relationships to each other and to dinosaurs remain a subject of debate. Here we report on a new avian-line archosaur from the early Middle Triassic (Anisian) of Tanzania. Phylogenetic analysis places Asilisaurus kongwe gen. et sp. nov. as an avian-line archosaur and a member of the Silesauridae, which is here considered the sister taxon to Dinosauria. Silesaurids were diverse and had a wide distribution by the Late Triassic, with a novel ornithodiran bauplan including leaf-shaped teeth, a beak-like lower jaw, long, gracile limbs, and a quadrupedal stance. Our analysis suggests that the dentition and diet of silesaurids, ornithischians and sauropodomorphs evolved independently from a plesiomorphic carnivorous form. As the oldest avian-line archosaur, Asilisaurus demonstrates the antiquity of both Ornithodira and the dinosaurian lineage. The initial diversification of Archosauria, previously documented by crocodilian-line archosaurs in the Anisian, can now be shown to include a contemporaneous avian-line radiation. The unparalleled taxonomic diversity of the Manda archosaur assemblage indicates that archosaur diversification was well underway by the Middle Triassic or earlier.
The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) has been implicated in morphogenetic events during formation of the nervous system. Three forms of N-CAM exist, all glycoprotein chains, of relative molecular masses 180,000 (180K), 140K and 120K (N-CAM180, N-CAM140 and N-CAM120) which are differentially expressed on neural cell types and during development. The three chains are thought to carry similar if not identical amino-acid sequences on their extracellular amino-terminal domains, but differ in the length of their carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic region. They occur in highly sialylated embryonic and less sialylated adult forms. N-CAM180 is selectively expressed in more differentiated neural cells and may play a role in the stabilization of cell contacts. To investigate this, we have studied in the surface membrane of a mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2A the lateral mobility of the two predominant forms of N-CAM, N-CAM180 and N-CAM140, as a function of differentiation. Here we report that as judged by fringe pattern photobleaching, the surface mobility of N-CAM140 is higher than that of N-CAM180, suggesting an association of N-CAM180 with the cytoskeleton or other stabilizing factors. We also show that brain spectrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein, binds only to N-CAM180. The immobilization of N-CAM in differentiated N2A cells is achieved by a shift in expression from N-CAM140 to N-CAM180.
We used molecular markers to study genetic relationships in a diverse collection of 85 domestic dog breeds. Differences among breeds accounted for approximately 30% of genetic variation. Microsatellite genotypes were used to correctly assign 99% of individual dogs to breeds. Phylogenetic analysis separated several breeds with ancient origins from the remaining breeds with modern European origins. We identified four genetic clusters, which predominantly contained breeds with similar geographic origin, morphology, or role in human activities. These results provide a genetic classification of dog breeds and will aid studies of the genetics of phenotypic breed differences.
Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) is the most common form of sporadic viral encephalitis in western countries. Its pathogenesis remains unclear, as it affects otherwise healthy patients and only a small minority of HSV-1-infected individuals. Here, we elucidate a genetic etiology for HSE in two children with autosomal recessive deficiency in the intracellular protein UNC-93B, resulting in impaired cellular interferon-alpha/beta and -lambda antiviral responses. HSE can result from a single-gene immunodeficiency that does not compromise immunity to most pathogens, unlike most known primary immunodeficiencies. Other severe infectious diseases may also reflect monogenic disorders of immunity.
Mononucleated and binucleated polyploid hepatocytes (4n, 8n, 16n and higher) are found in all mammalian species, but the functional significance of this conserved phenomenon remains unknown. Polyploidization occurs through failed cytokinesis, begins at weaning in rodents and increases with age. Previously, we demonstrated that the opposite event, ploidy reversal, also occurs in polyploid hepatocytes generated by artificial cell fusion. This raised the possibility that somatic 'reductive mitoses' can also happen in normal hepatocytes. Here we show that multipolar mitotic spindles form frequently in mouse polyploid hepatocytes and can result in one-step ploidy reversal to generate offspring with halved chromosome content. Proliferating hepatocytes produce a highly diverse population of daughter cells with multiple numerical chromosome imbalances as well as uniparental origins. Our findings support a dynamic model of hepatocyte polyploidization, ploidy reversal and aneuploidy, a phenomenon that we term the 'ploidy conveyor'. We propose that this mechanism evolved to generate genetic diversity and permits adaptation of hepatocytes to xenobiotic or nutritional injury.
There is much recent interest in exploiting the spin of conduction electrons in semiconductor heterostructures together with their charge to realize new device concepts. Electrical currents are usually generated by electric or magnetic fields, or by gradients of, for example, carrier concentration or temperature. The electron spin in a spin-polarized electron gas can, in principle, also drive an electrical current, even at room temperature, if some general symmetry requirements are met. Here we demonstrate such a 'spin-galvanic' effect in semiconductor heterostructures, induced by a non-equilibrium, but uniform population of electron spins. The microscopic origin for this effect is that the two electronic sub-bands for spin-up and spin-down electrons are shifted in momentum space and, although the electron distribution in each sub-band is symmetric, there is an inherent asymmetry in the spin-flip scattering events between the two sub-bands. The resulting current flow has been detected by applying a magnetic field to rotate an optically oriented non-equilibrium spin polarization in the direction of the sample plane. In contrast to previous experiments, where spin-polarized currents were driven by electric fields in semiconductor, we have here the complementary situation where electron spins drive a current without the need of an external electric field.
Although people's legs are capable of a broad range of muscle-use and gait patterns, they generally prefer just two. They walk, swinging their body over a relatively straight leg with each step, or run, bouncing up off a bent leg between aerial phases. Walking feels easiest when going slowly, and running feels easiest when going faster. More unusual gaits seem more tiring. Perhaps this is because walking and running use the least energy. Addressing this classic conjecture with experiments requires comparing walking and running with many other strange and unpractised gaits. As an alternative, a basic understanding of gait choice might be obtained by calculating energy cost by using mechanics-based models. Here we use a minimal model that can describe walking and running as well as an infinite variety of other gaits. We use computer optimization to find which gaits are indeed energetically optimal for this model. At low speeds the optimization discovers the classic inverted-pendulum walk, at high speeds it discovers a bouncing run, even without springs, and at intermediate speeds it finds a new pendular-running gait that includes walking and running as extreme cases.
Egg and sperm cells (gametes) of the mouse are derived from a founder population of primordial germ cells that are set aside early in embryogenesis. Primordial germ cells arise from the proximal epiblast, a region of the early mouse embryo that also contributes to the first blood lineages of the embryonic yolk sac. Embryonic stem cells differentiate in vitro into cystic structures called embryoid bodies consisting of tissue lineages typical of the early mouse embryo. Because embryoid bodies sustain blood development, we reasoned that they might also support primordial germ cell formation. Here we isolate primordial germ cells from embryoid bodies, and derive continuously growing lines of embryonic germ cells. Embryonic germ cells show erasure of the methylation markers (imprints) of the Igf2r and H19 genes, a property characteristic of the germ lineage. We show that embryoid bodies support maturation of the primordial germ cells into haploid male gametes, which when injected into oocytes restore the somatic diploid chromosome complement and develop into blastocysts. Our ability to derive germ cells from embryonic stem cells provides an accessible in vitro model system for studies of germline epigenetic modification and mammalian gametogenesis.
The post-translational modifications of histone tails generate a 'histone code' that defines local and global chromatin states. The resultant regulation of gene function is thought to govern cell fate, proliferation and differentiation. Reversible histone modifications such as methylation are under mutual controls to organize chromosomal events. Among the histone modifications, methylation of specific lysine and arginine residues seems to be critical for chromatin configuration and control of gene expression. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) changes chromatin into a transcriptionally active state. Reversible modification of proteins by beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in response to serum glucose levels regulates diverse cellular processes. However, the epigenetic impact of protein GlcNAcylation is unknown. Here we report that nuclear GlcNAcylation of a histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMT), MLL5, by O-GlcNAc transferase facilitates retinoic-acid-induced granulopoiesis in human HL60 promyelocytes through methylation of H3K4. MLL5 is biochemically identified in a GlcNAcylation-dependent multi-subunit complex associating with nuclear retinoic acid receptor RARalpha (also known as RARA), serving as a mono- and di-methyl transferase to H3K4. GlcNAcylation at Thr 440 in the MLL5 SET domain evokes its H3K4 HKMT activity and co-activates RARalpha in target gene promoters. Increased nuclear GlcNAcylation by means of O-GlcNAc transferase potentiates retinoic-acid-induced HL60 granulopoiesis and restores the retinoic acid response in the retinoic-acid-resistant HL60-R2 cell line. Thus, nuclear MLL5 GlcNAcylation triggers cell lineage determination of HL60 through activation of its HKMT activity.
When selection favors sexual dimorphism, high-fitness parents often produce low-fitness progeny of the opposite sex. This sexual conflict is thought to overwhelm the genetic benefits of mate choice because preferred males incur a cost through the production of low-fitness daughters. We provide a counterpoint in a lizard (Anolis sagrei) that exhibits sexual conflict over body size. By using mate-choice experiments, we show that female brown anoles produce more sons than daughters via large sires but more daughters than sons via small sires. Measures of progeny fitness in the wild suggest that maximal fitness payoffs can be achieved by shifting offspring production from daughters to sons as sire size increases. These results illustrate how the resolution of sexual conflict can restore the genetic benefits of mate choice.
Several observations suggest that retroviral infection is involved in the pathogenesis of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). First, lymphadenopathy-associated virus/human T-lymphotropic virus type III (LAV/HTLV-III), the agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), has been shown to be neurotropic in man. Second, the genetic organization of the lentivirus visna, which causes a chronic demyelinating disease of sheep, closely resembles that of LAV/HTLV-III. Recently, Koprowski and colleagues reported that MS is associated both with raised levels of circulating antibodies to HTLV-I and with the presence of HTLV-I-specific RNA within cell lines derived from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here we report that no HTLV-I-like or LAV/HTLV-III-like sequences can be detected, by in situ hybridization, in central nervous system (CNS) tissues from MS patients, and that nonspecific HTLV-I-like signal in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in CSF cell lines is characteristic of MS. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of circulating and CSF antibodies for HTLV-I reactivity fails to distinguish between MS and control groups.
Asthma now affects one child in seven in the United Kingdom. Most cases (95%) of childhood asthma are associated with atopy, the immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated familial syndrome of allergic asthma, eczema and rhinitis. Segregation analysis has consistently suggested the presence of major genes influencing atopy and IgE levels, with the expectation that these genes may be identified by positional cloning or the examination of candidate genes. Here we report the results of a genome-wide search for linkage to one qualitative and four quantitative traits associated with allergic (atopic) asthma. We have identified six potential linkages (P<0.001), five of which are to quantitative traits. Monte Carlo simulations show that 1.6 false-positive linkages at this level of significance would be expected from the data. One linkage, to chromosome 11q13, has been established previously. Three of the new loci show evidence of linkage to a second panel of families, in which maternal effects and pleiotropy of linked phenotypes are seen. The results demonstrate the extent and the complexity of the genetic predisposition to asthma.
Most current models propose Sonic hedgehog (Shh) as the primary determinant of anteroposterior development of amniote limbs. Shh protein is said to be required to direct the formation of skeletal elements and to specify digit identity through dose-dependent activation of target gene expression. However, the identity of genes targeted by Shh, and the regulatory mechanisms controlling their expression, remain poorly understood. Gli3 (the gene implicated in human Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome) is proposed to negatively regulate Shh by restricting its expression and influence to the posterior mesoderm. Here we report genetic analyses in mice showing that Shh and Gli3 are dispensable for formation of limb skeletal elements: Shh(-/-) Gli3(-/-) limbs are distally complete and polydactylous, but completely lack wild-type digit identities. We show that the effects of Shh signalling on skeletal patterning and ridge maintenance are necessarily mediated through Gli3. We propose that the function of Shh and Gli3 in limb skeletal patterning is limited to refining autopodial morphology, imposing pentadactyl constraint on the limb's polydactyl potential, and organizing digit identity specification, by regulating the relative balance of Gli3 transcriptional activator and repressor activities.
The extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM proteins are important in phenomena as diverse as developmental patterning, stem cell niches, cancer, and genetic diseases. The ECM has many effects beyond providing structural support. ECM proteins typically include multiple, independently folded domains whose sequences and arrangement are highly conserved. Some of these domains bind adhesion receptors such as integrins that mediate cell-matrix adhesion and also transduce signals into cells. However, ECM proteins also bind soluble growth factors and regulate their distribution, activation, and presentation to cells. As organized, solid-phase ligands, ECM proteins can integrate complex, multivalent signals to cells in a spatially patterned and regulated fashion. These properties need to be incorporated into considerations of the functions of the ECM.
Although classical genetic and biochemical approaches have identified hundreds of proteins that function in the dynamic remodeling of cell shape in response to upstream signals, there is currently little systems-level understanding of the organization and composition of signaling networks that regulate cell morphology. We have developed quantitative morphological profiling methods to systematically investigate the role of individual genes in the regulation of cell morphology in a fast, robust, and cost-efficient manner. We analyzed a compendium of quantitative morphological signatures and described the existence of local signaling networks that act to regulate cell protrusion, adhesion, and tension.
A gradient of the maternal morphogen dorsal establishes asymmetric patterns of gene expression along the dorsal-ventral axis of early embryos and activates the regulatory genes twist and snail, which are responsible for the differentiation of the ventral mesoderm. Expression of snail is restricted to the presumptive mesoderm, and the sharp lateral limits of this expression help to define the mesoderm-neuroectoderm boundary by repressing the expression of regulatory genes that are responsible for the differentiation of the neuroectoderm. The snail gene encodes a zinc finger protein, and neuroectodermal genes that are normally restricted to ventral-lateral regions of early embryos are expressed throughout ventral regions of snail- mutants. The formation of the sharp snail border involves dosage-sensitive interactions between dorsal and twist, which encode regulatory proteins that are related to the mammalian transcription factors NF-kB and MyoD, respectively.
Reduced food intake as a result of dietary restriction increases the lifespan of a wide variety of metazoans and delays the onset of multiple age-related pathologies. Dietary restriction elicits a genetically programmed response to nutrient availability that cannot be explained by a simple reduction in metabolism or slower growth of the organism. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the transcription factor PHA-4 has an essential role in the embryonic development of the foregut and is orthologous to genes encoding the mammalian family of Foxa transcription factors, Foxa1, Foxa2 and Foxa3. Foxa family members have important roles during development, but also act later in life to regulate glucagon production and glucose homeostasis, particularly in response to fasting. Here we describe a newly discovered, adult-specific function for PHA-4 in the regulation of diet-restriction-mediated longevity in C. elegans. The role of PHA-4 in lifespan determination is specific for dietary restriction, because it is not required for the increased longevity caused by other genetic pathways that regulate ageing.
Genetic recombination of DNA is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the evolution of DNA-based organisms and results in their diversity and adaptability. The importance of the role of recombination is far less evident for the RNA-based genomes that occur in most plant viruses and in many animal viruses. RNA recombination has been shown to promote the evolutionary variation of picornaviruses, it is involved in the creation of defective interfering (DI) RNAs of positive- and negative-strand viruses and is implicated in the synthesis of the messenger RNAs of influenza virus and coronavirus. However, RNA recombination has not been found to date in viruses that infect plants. In fact, the lack of DI RNAs and the inability to demonstrate recombination in mixedly infected plants has been regarded as evidence that plants do not support recombination of viral RNAs. Here we provide the first molecular evidence for recombination of plant viral RNA. For brome mosaic virus (BMV), a plus-stranded, tripartite-genome virus of monocots, we show that a deletion in the 3' end region of a single BMV RNA genomic component can be repaired during the development of infection by recombination with the homologous region of either of the two remaining wild-type BMV RNA components. This result clearly shows that plant viruses have available powerful recombinatory mechanisms that previously were thought to exist only in animal hosts, thus they are able to adapt and diversify in a manner comparable to animal viruses. Moreover, our observation suggests an increased versatility of viruses for use as vectors in introducing new genes into plants.
Aged humans sustain a high rate of epithelial cancers such as carcinomas of the breast and colon, whereas mice carrying common tumour suppressor gene mutations typically develop soft tissue sarcomas and lymphomas. Among the many factors that may contribute to this species variance are differences in telomere length and regulation. Telomeres comprise the nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and are maintained by the reverse transcriptase, telomerase. In human cells, insufficient levels of telomerase lead to telomere attrition with cell division in culture and possibly with ageing and tumorigenesis in vivo. In contrast, critical reduction in telomere length is not observed in the mouse owing to promiscuous telomerase expression and long telomeres. Here we provide evidence that telomere attrition in ageing telomerase-deficient p53 mutant mice promotes the development of epithelial cancers by a process of fusion-bridge breakage that leads to the formation of complex non-reciprocal translocations--a classical cytogenetic feature of human carcinomas. Our data suggest a model in which telomere dysfunction brought about by continual epithelial renewal during life generates the massive ploidy changes associated with the development of epithelial cancers.
Results from various experiments suggest that the cell surface has an important role in development. However, there is relatively little information on the specific surface molecules involved in developmental processes. In an effort to characterize cell-surface components that may be involved in Drosophila development, we have been making monoclonal antibodies against D. melanogaster imaginal disks. The holometabolous insects are unusual in that scattered among the larval tissues are groups of undifferentiated imaginal cells which, during metamorphosis, will form most of the adult insect. The imaginal disks, which we use as an immunogen, are hollow sacs of cells; each disk will form a specific part of the adult cuticle. Other imaginal cells are found as nests or rings in various larval organs. We describe here results indicating that one of the clones we have isolated, DA.1B6, makes an antibody against an antigen which, in larvae, is generally restricted to the undifferentiated sheets of imaginal epithelial cells. This and other results indicate that the antigen is specific for the diploid epithelia in Drosophila.
Chick and mouse cell monolayers treated with interferon were significantly protected from destruction by toxoplasma. The results suggest that fewer numbers of organisms were released from interferon-treated cells. Interferons were uniformly more active in a viral assay than in a toxoplasma assay, and they had the same properties in both assays. The data suggest that interferon activity may be directed against organisms phylogenetically higher than viruses.
We have assembled data from Caenorhabditis elegans DNA microarray experiments involving many growth conditions, developmental stages, and varieties of mutants. Co-regulated genes were grouped together and visualized in a three-dimensional expression map that displays correlations of gene expression profiles as distances in two dimensions and gene density in the third dimension. The gene expression map can be used as a gene discovery tool to identify genes that are co-regulated with known sets of genes (such as heat shock, growth control genes, germ line genes, and so forth) or to uncover previously unknown genetic functions (such as genomic instability in males and sperm caused by specific transposons).
Odorant stimulation leads to a depolarization of olfactory receptor neurons. A mechanism underlying this transduction, which occurs in the sensory cilia, involves a G-protein-mediated increase in adenylyl cyclase activity, and therefore a rise in internal cyclic AMP and consequent opening of a cAMP-gated cation channel on the plasma membrane. Another mechanism, not as well established, involves the opening of an inositol trisphosphate-activated cation channel on the plasma membrane as a result of phospholipase C activity. In both cases, an influx of cations is thought to generate the depolarizing receptor potential. We now report, however, that the mechanism is actually more complex. The odorant-induced current appears to contain an inward chloride component also, which is triggered by calcium influx through the cation-selective channel. This newly found chloride component can be as large as the cationic component. The co-existence of cationic and chloride components in the odorant response, possibly unique among sensory transduction mechanisms, may serve to reduce variations in the transduction current resulting from changes in external ionic concentrations around the olfactory cilia. Our finding can explain the long-standing puzzle of why removal of most mucosal cations still does not diminish the amplitude of the olfactory receptor cell response.
Aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases catalyse the first step of protein synthesis and establish the rules of the genetic code through the aminoacylation of tRNAs. There is a distinct synthetase for each of the 20 amino acids and throughout evolution these enzymes have been divided into two classes of ten enzymes each. These classes are defined by the distinct architectures of their active sites, which are associated with specific and universal sequence motifs. Because the synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNAs containing each of the twenty amino acids is a universally conserved, essential reaction, the absence of a recognizable gene for cysteinyl tRNA synthetase in the genomes of Archae such as Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum has been difficult to interpret. Here we describe a different cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase from M. jannaschii and Deinococcus radiodurans and its characterization in vitro and in vivo. This protein lacks the characteristic sequence motifs seen in the more than 700 known members of the two canonical classes of tRNA synthetase and may be of ancient origin. The existence of this protein contrasts with proposals that aminoacylation with cysteine in M. jannaschii is an auxiliary function of a canonical prolyl-tRNA synthetase.
Cryptococcus neoformans is a globally distributed human fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients. It has a defined sexual cycle involving haploid cells of alpha and a mating types, yet the vast majority of environmental and clinical isolates are alpha (ref. 3). Sexual recombination is normally expected to occur between isolates of opposite mating type in organisms with two mating types (or sexes). How sexual reproductive potential can be maintained in an organism with a largely unisexual, nearly clonal population genetic structure is unknown. One clue, however, is that alpha strains undergo fruiting, a process that resembles sexual mating but is thought to be strictly mitotic and asexual. We report here that hallmarks of mating occur during fruiting, including diploidization and meiosis. Pheromone response pathway elements and the key meiotic regulator Dmc1 are required for efficient fruiting. Furthermore, fusion and meiosis can occur between non-isogenic alpha strains, enabling genetic exchange. These studies reveal how sexual reproduction can occur between partners of the same mating type. These findings have implications for the evolution of microbial pathogens, as well as for parthenogenesis, cell fusion events and transitions between self-fertilizing and outcrossing modes of reproduction observed in both fungi and other kingdoms.
Recent controversies about genetically modified foods in the United Kingdom and several other European countries highlight the apparent differences that exist in public opinion on this subject across the Atlantic. Why are people in the United States seemingly untroubled by a technology that causes Europeans so many difficulties? The results of survey research on public perceptions of biotechnology in Europe and the United States during 1996-1997, together with an analysis of press coverage and policy formation from 1984 to 1996, can help to answer this question.
Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology has recently been used to generate animals with a common genetic composition. In this study, we report the derivation of a pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cell line (SCNT-hES-1) from a cloned human blastocyst. The SCNT-hES-1 cells displayed typical ES cell morphology and cell surface markers and were capable of differentiating into embryoid bodies in vitro and of forming teratomas in vivo containing cell derivatives from all three embryonic germ layers in severe combined immunodeficient mice. After continuous proliferation for more than 70 passages, SCNT-hES-1 cells maintained normal karyotypes and were genetically identical to the somatic nuclear donor cells. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the cells had a parthenogenetic origin, imprinting analyses support a SCNT origin of the derived human ES cells.
The origin of the RNA world is not easily understood, as effective prebiotic syntheses of the components of RNA, the beta-ribofuranoside-5'-phosphates, are hard to envisage. Recognition of this difficulty has led to the proposal that other genetic systems, the components of which are more easily formed, may have preceded RNA. This raises the question of how transitions between one genetic system and another could occur. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) resembles RNA in its ability to form double-helical complexes stabilized by Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding between adenine and thymine and between cytosine and guanine, but has a backbone that is held together by amide rather than by phosphodiester bonds. Oligonucleotides bases on RNA are known to act as templates that catalyse the non-enzymatic synthesis of their complements from activated mononucleotides, we now show that RNA oligonucleotides facilitate the synthesis of complementary PNA strands and vice versa. This suggests that a transition between different genetic systems can occur without loss of information.
The specific bonding of DNA base pairs provides the chemical foundation for genetics. This powerful molecular recognition system can be used in nanotechnology to direct the assembly of highly structured materials with specific nanoscale features, as well as in DNA computation to process complex information. The exploitation of DNA for material purposes presents a new chapter in the history of the molecule.
Viruses replicate within living cells and use the cellular machinery for the synthesis of their genome and other components. To gain access, they have evolved a variety of elegant mechanisms to deliver their genes and accessory proteins into the host cell. Many animal viruses take advantage of endocytic pathways and rely on the cell to guide them through a complex entry and uncoating program. In the dialogue between the cell and the intruder, the cell provides critical cues that allow the virus to undergo molecular transformations that lead to successful internalization, intra-cellular transport, and uncoating.
It is desirable to minimize the use of rare or toxic metals for oxidative reactions in the synthesis of pharmaceutical products. Hypervalent iodine compounds are environmentally benign alternatives, but their catalytic use, particularly for asymmetric transformations, has been quite limited. We report here an enantioselective oxidative cycloetherification of ketophenols to 2-acyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran derivatives, catalyzed by in situ-generated chiral quaternary ammonium (hypo)iodite salts, with hydrogen peroxide as an environmentally benign oxidant. The optically active 2-acyl 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran skeleton is a key structure in several biologically active compounds.
Molecular fossils of biological lipids are preserved in 2700-million-year-old shales from the Pilbara Craton, Australia. Sequential extraction of adjacent samples shows that these hydrocarbon biomarkers are indigenous and syngenetic to the Archean shales, greatly extending the known geological range of such molecules. The presence of abundant 2alpha-methylhopanes, which are characteristic of cyanobacteria, indicates that oxygenic photosynthesis evolved well before the atmosphere became oxidizing. The presence of steranes, particularly cholestane and its 28- to 30-carbon analogs, provides persuasive evidence for the existence of eukaryotes 500 million to 1 billion years before the extant fossil record indicates that the lineage arose.
The vitamin A derivative, retinoic acid, can regulate morphogenesis and differentiation in vertebrates. Two different subfamilies of the steroid receptor superfamily of transcription factors, the retinoic acid receptors and the retinoid X receptor, mediate the effects of retinoic acid. As part of an analysis of the hormonal control of development, we have examined the Drosophila genome for retinoic acid receptor homologues. Here we describe one such gene, XR2C, which encodes a product with structural similarity to the human retinoic acid-responsive transcription factor, retinoid X receptor. This receptor-like protein is encoded by ultraspiracle (usp), a locus required both maternally and zygotically for pattern formation. The discovery that the usp product is a retinoid X receptor homologue suggests that similar chemical cues underlie morphogenic signalling in vertebrate and invertebrate systems.
Cadmium is a potent poison for living cells. In man, chronic exposure to low levels of cadmium results in damage to kidneys and has been linked to neoplastic disease and ageing, and acute exposure can cause damage to a variety of organs and tissues. Cadmium reacts with thiol groups and can substitute for zinc in certain proteins, but the reason for its toxicity in vivo remains uncertain. In eukaryotes, an important selective proteolysis pathway for the elimination of abnormal proteins that are generated under normal or stress conditions is ATP-dependent and mediated by the ubiquitin system. Substrates of this pathway are first recognized by ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (or auxiliary factors) which covalently attach ubiquitin, a small and highly conserved protein, to specific internal lysine residues of proteolytic substrates. Ubiquitinated substrates are then degraded by the proteasome, a multisubunit protease complex. Here we show that expression of this ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis pathway in yeast is activated in response to cadmium exposure and that mutants deficient in specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are hypersensitive to cadmium. Moreover, mutants in the proteasome are hypersensitive to cadmium, suggesting that cadmium resistance is mediated in part by degradation of abnormal proteins. This indicates that a major reason for cadmium toxicity may be cadmium-induced formation of abnormal proteins.
The ability of antibodies to neutralize diverse primary isolates of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 in vitro has been questioned, with implications for the likely efficacy of vaccines. A recombinant human antibody to envelope glycoprotein gp120 was generated and used to show that primary isolates are not refractory to antibody neutralization. The recombinant antibody neutralized more than 75 percent of the primary isolates tested at concentrations that could be achieved by passive immunization, for example, to interrupt maternal-fetal transmission of virus. The broad specificity and efficacy of the antibody implies the conservation of a structural feature on gp120, which could be important in vaccine design.
The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies include senile plaques and/or neurofibrillary tangles. Although mouse models have been created by overexpressing specific proteins including beta-amyloid precursor protein, presenilin and tau, no model has been generated by gene knockout. Phosphorylation of tau and other proteins on serine or threonine residues preceding proline seems to precede tangle formation and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Notably, these phospho(Ser/Thr)-Pro motifs exist in two distinct conformations, whose conversion in some proteins is catalysed by the Pin1 prolyl isomerase. Pin1 activity can directly restore the conformation and function of phosphorylated tau or it can do so indirectly by promoting its dephosphorylation, which suggests that Pin1 is involved in neurodegeneration; however, genetic evidence is lacking. Here we show that Pin1 expression is inversely correlated with predicted neuronal vulnerability and actual neurofibrillary degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Pin1 knockout in mice causes progressive age-dependent neuropathy characterized by motor and behavioural deficits, tau hyperphosphorylation, tau filament formation and neuronal degeneration. Thus, Pin1 is pivotal in protecting against age-dependent neurodegeneration, providing insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.
Ligand-dependent downregulation of tyrosine kinase receptors is a critical step for modulating their activity. Upon ligand binding, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (Met) is polyubiquitinated and degraded; however, the mechanisms underlying HGF receptor endocytosis are not yet known. Here we demonstrate that a complex involving endophilins, CIN85 and Cbl controls this process. Endophilins are regulatory components of clathrin-coated vesicle formation. Through their acyl-transferase activity they are thought to modify the membrane phospholipids and induce negative curvature and invagination of the plasma membrane during the early steps of endocytosis. Furthermore, by means of their Src-homology 3 domains, endophilins are able to bind CIN85, a recently identified protein that interacts with the Cbl proto-oncogene. Cbl, in turn, binds and ubiquitinates activated HGF receptor, and by recruiting the endophilin-CIN85 complex, it regulates receptor internalization. Inhibition of complex formation is sufficient to block HGF receptor internalization and to enhance HGF-induced signal transduction and biological responses. These data provide further evidence of a relationship between receptor-mediated signalling and endocytosis, and disclose a novel functional role for Cbl in HGF receptor signalling.
The arthropods constitute the most diverse animal group, but, despite their rich fossil record and a century of study, their phylogenetic relationships remain unclear. Taxa previously proposed to be sister groups to the arthropods include Annelida, Onychophora, Tardigrada and others, but hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships have been conflicting. For example, onychophorans, like arthropods, moult periodically, have an arthropod arrangement of haemocoel, and have been related to arthropods in morphological and mitochondrial DNA sequence analyses. Like annelids, they possess segmental nephridia and muscles that are a combination of smooth and obliquely striated fibres. Our phylogenetic analysis of 18S ribosomal DNA sequences indicates a close relationship between arthropods, nematodes and all other moulting phyla. The results suggest that ecdysis (moulting) arose once and support the idea of a new clade, Ecdysozoa, containing moulting animals: arthropods, tardigrades, onychophorans, nematodes, nematomorphs, kinorhynchs and priapulids. No support is found for a clade of segmented animals, the Articulata, uniting annelids with arthropods. The hypothesis that nematodes are related to arthropods has important implications for developmental genetic studies using as model systems the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the arthropod Drosophila melanogaster, which are generally held to be phylogenetically distant from each other.
In most models of DNA replication, Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding drives the incorporation of nucleotides into the new strand of DNA and maintains the complementarity of bases with the template strand. Studies with nonpolar analogues of thymine and adenine, however, have shown that replication is still efficient in the absence of hydrogen bonds. The replication of base pairs might also be influenced by steric exclusion, whereby inserted nucleotides need to be the correct size and shape to fit the active site against a template base. A simple steric-exclusion model may not require Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding to explain the fidelity of replication, nor should canonical purine and pyrimidine shapes be necessary for enzymatic synthesis of a base pair if each can fit into the DNA double helix without steric strain. Here we test this idea by using a pyrene nucleoside triphosphate (dPTP) in which the fluorescent 'base' is nearly as large as an entire Watson-Crick base pair. We show that the non-hydrogen-bonding dPTP is efficiently and specifically inserted by DNA polymerases opposite sites that lack DNA bases. The efficiency of this process approaches that of a natural base pair and the specificity is 10(2)-10(4)-fold. We use these properties to sequence abasic lesions in DNA, which are a common form of DNA damage in vivo. In addition to their application in identifying such genetic lesions, our results show that neither hydrogen bonds nor purine and pyrimidine structures are required to form a base pair with high efficiency and selectivity. These findings confirm that steric complementarity is an important factor in the fidelity of DNA synthesis.
The mutation rate per genome for local affecting fitness is crucial in theories of the evolution of sex and recombination and of outbreeding mechanisms. Mutational variation in fitness may also be important in the evolution of mate choice in animals. No information is available on the rate at which spontaneous mutations with small effects on fitness arise, although viability (probability of survival to adulthood) has been studied in Drosophila melanogaster. These experiments involved the accumulation of spontaneous mutations in the virtual absence of natural selection, in a set of independently maintained lines with a common origin. The rates of decline in mean and increase in variance among lines permit estimation of limits to the mean number of new mutations arising per generation (U) and the average homozygous effect of a new mutation of minor effect(s). For the second chromosome of D. melanogaster, the value of U is at least 0.17 (ref. 7), and (1-h)s is less than 0.02, where hs is the average decline in fitness of heterozygotes. As the second chromosome is about 40% of the genome, these data indicate a mutation rate per haploid genome of at least 0.42 for viability. Here we present similar data on the effects of homozygous spontaneous mutations on a measure of fitness in D. melanogaster.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, with a prevalence of 2-14 per 100,000 individuals. The disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and sustained muscle contraction, often with a wide range of accompanying symptoms. The age at onset and severity of the disease show extreme variation, both within and between families. Despite its clinical variability, this dominant condition segregates as a single locus at chromosome 19q13.3 in every population studied. It is flanked by the tightly linked genetic markers ERCC1 proximally and D19S51 distally; these define the DM critical region. We report the isolation of an expressed sequence from this region which detects a DNA fragment that is larger in affected individuals than in normal siblings or unaffected controls. The size of this fragment varies between affected siblings, and increases in size through generations in parallel with increasing severity of the disease. We postulate that this unstable DNA sequence is the molecular feature that underlies DM.
Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is generally associated with epigenetic silencing of transcription and is maintained through cellular division. Multiple CpG sequences are rare in mammalian genomes, but frequently occur at the transcriptional start site of active genes, with most clusters of CpGs being hypomethylated. We reported previously that the proximal region of the trefoil factor 1 (TFF1, also known as pS2) and oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) promoters could be partially methylated by treatment with deacetylase inhibitors, suggesting the possibility of dynamic changes in DNA methylation. Here we show that cyclical methylation and demethylation of CpG dinucleotides, with a periodicity of around 100 min, is characteristic for five selected promoters, including the oestrogen (E2)-responsive pS2 gene, in human cells. When the pS2 gene is actively transcribed, DNA methylation occurs after the cyclical occupancy of ERalpha and RNA polymerase II (polII). Moreover, we report conditions that provoke methylation cycling of the pS2 promoter in cell lines in which pS2 expression is quiescent and the proximal promoter is methylated. This coincides with a low-level re-expression of ERalpha and of pS2 transcripts.
In work reported on page 452, researchers have found a way to coax certain introns, bits of genetic debris that litter the DNA and interrupt the coding sequences of many genes, to hop into the exact sequences where the researchers want them. The method could enhance all sorts of genetic manipulations, from studying basic gene function to combating viral infections to delivering genes for gene therapy.
Individuals in socially monogamous species may participate in copulations outside of the pair bond, resulting in extra-pair offspring. Although males benefit from such extra-pair behavior if they produce more offspring, the adaptive function of infidelity to females remains elusive. Here we show that female participation in extra-pair copulations, combined with a genetically loaded process of sperm competition, enables female finches to target genes that are optimally compatible with their own to ensure fertility and optimize offspring viability. Such female behavior, along with the postcopulatory processes demonstrated here, may provide an adaptive function of female infidelity in socially monogamous animals.
Several dysgenic traits may occur within the Drosophila melanogaster species as a result of crosses between different strains. Crossing two mutually interacting categories, named inducer and reactive, may lead, among other abnormalities, to a specific kind of female sterility that has proved useful for investigating the genetic factors involved in the interaction. The reactive state  appears to result from a cytoplasmic state ultimately controlled by a chromosomal polygenic system. The inducer character is determined by a chromosomal factor that exhibits all characteristics of a transposable element. Overall, the data contribute to clarification of mutator activities in D. melanogaster and open new opportunities to investigate unusual genetic mechanisms.
The introduction of foreign mitochondria or mitochondrial DNA into a cell is a useful technique for clarifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of mitochondria. Novel combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have been studied in mammalian cells in culture and in yeast. In Drosophila, we have recently constructed heteroplasmic flies possessing both endogenous mitochondrial DNA and foreign mitochondrial DNA by intra- and interspecific transplantation of germ plasm. During the maintenance of these heteroplasmic lines, flies of D. melanogaster are produced that no longer possess their own mitochondrial DNA but retain the foreign mitochondrial DNA from D. mauritiana. . These flies are fertile and the foreign mitochondrial DNA is stably maintained in their offspring. Here we report the complete replacement of endogenous mitochondrial DNA with that from another multicellular species. Molecular and genetic analysis of this replacement in Drosophila should provide new insight into the functional interaction between nuclear and organelle genomes.
The conserved Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) generates trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a modification associated with stable epigenetic silencing. Much is known about PRC2-induced silencing but key questions remain concerning its nucleation and stability. Vernalization, the perception and memory of winter in plants, is a classic epigenetic process that, in Arabidopsis, involves PRC2-based silencing of the floral repressor FLC. The slow dynamics of vernalization, taking place over weeks in the cold, generate a level of stable silencing of FLC in the subsequent warm that depends quantitatively on the length of the prior cold. These features make vernalization an ideal experimental system to investigate both the maintenance of epigenetic states and the switching between them. Here, using mathematical modelling, chromatin immunoprecipitation and an FLC:GUS reporter assay, we show that the quantitative nature of vernalization is generated by H3K27me3-mediated FLC silencing in the warm in a subpopulation of cells whose number depends on the length of the prior cold. During the cold, H3K27me3 levels progressively increase at a tightly localized nucleation region within FLC. At the end of the cold, numerical simulations predict that such a nucleation region is capable of switching the bistable epigenetic state of an individual locus, with the probability of overall FLC coverage by silencing H3K27me3 marks depending on the length of cold exposure. Thus, the model predicts a bistable pattern of FLC gene expression in individual cells, a prediction we verify using the FLC:GUS reporter system. Our proposed switching mechanism, involving the local nucleation of an opposing histone modification, is likely to be widely relevant in epigenetic reprogramming.
Susceptibility to asthma depends on variation at an unknown number of genetic loci. To identify susceptibility genes on chromosome 7p, we adopted a hierarchical genotyping design, leading to the identification of a 133-kilobase risk-conferring segment containing two genes. One of these coded for an orphan G protein-coupled receptor named GPRA (G protein-coupled receptor for asthma susceptibility), which showed distinct distribution of protein isoforms between bronchial biopsies from healthy and asthmatic individuals. In three cohorts from Finland and Canada, single nucleotide polymorphism-tagged haplotypes associated with high serum immunoglobulin E or asthma. The murine ortholog of GPRA was up-regulated in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced inflammation. Together, these data implicate GPRA in the pathogenesis of atopy and asthma.
Deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA) results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a candidate genetic disorder for somatic cell gene therapy. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients affected by ADA- SCID were transduced with a retroviral vector for human ADA and injected into immunodeficient mice. Long-term survival of vector-transduced human cells was demonstrated in recipient animals. Expression of vector-derived ADA restored immune functions, as indicated by the presence in reconstituted animals of human immunoglobulin and antigen-specific T cells. Retroviral vector gene transfer, therefore, is necessary and sufficient for development of specific immune functions in vivo and has therapeutic potential to correct this lethal immunodeficiency.
Examination of genotypes of female-pup nursing pairs taken from large maternity colonies of the Mexican free-tailed bat in Texas demonstrates that nursing is nonrandom and selective along genetic (kinship) lines. This is contrary to previous reports that nursing in these colonies is indiscriminate. Although nursing is nonrandom, an estimated 17 percent of the females sampled were nursing pups that could not be their offspring. This "nonparental" nursing is an apparent result of the difficulties females face in consistently relocating and selectively nursing their own pups within these enormous colonies.
Linkage groups of a culicine mosquito, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, have been assigned to their respective chromosomes by genetic and cytologic observations of radiation-induced aberrations. Linkage group I is assigned to the smallest chromosome, linkage group II to the submetacentric chromosome, and linkage group III to the metacentric chromosome.
Mass spectrometry is a powerful technology for the analysis of large numbers of endogenous proteins. However, the analytical challenges associated with comprehensive identification and relative quantification of cellular proteomes have so far appeared to be insurmountable. Here, using advances in computational proteomics, instrument performance and sample preparation strategies, we compare protein levels of essentially all endogenous proteins in haploid yeast cells to their diploid counterparts. Our analysis spans more than four orders of magnitude in protein abundance with no discrimination against membrane or low level regulatory proteins. Stable-isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) quantification was very accurate across the proteome, as demonstrated by one-to-one ratios of most yeast proteins. Key members of the pheromone pathway were specific to haploid yeast but others were unaltered, suggesting an efficient control mechanism of the mating response. Several retrotransposon-associated proteins were specific to haploid yeast. Gene ontology analysis pinpointed a significant change for cell wall components in agreement with geometrical considerations: diploid cells have twice the volume but not twice the surface area of haploid cells. Transcriptome levels agreed poorly with proteome changes overall. However, after filtering out low confidence microarray measurements, messenger RNA changes and SILAC ratios correlated very well for pheromone pathway components. Systems-wide, precise quantification directly at the protein level opens up new perspectives in post-genomics and systems biology.
Duchenne progressive muscular dystrophy is a lethal and common X-linked genetic disease caused by the absence of dystrophin, a 427K protein encoded by a 14 kilobase transcript. Two approaches have been proposed to correct the dystrophin deficiency in muscle. The first, myoblast transfer therapy, uses cells from normal donors, whereas the second involves direct intramuscular injection of recombinant plasmids expressing dystrophin. Adenovirus is an efficient vector for in vivo expression of various foreign genes. It has recently been demonstrated that a recombinant adenovirus expressing the lac-Z reporter gene can infect stably many mouse tissues, particularly muscle and heart. We have tested the ability of a recombinant adenovirus, containing a 6.3 kilobase pair Becker-like dystrophin complementary DNA driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter to direct the expression of a 'minidystrophin' in infected 293 cells and C2 myoblasts, and in the mdx mouse, after intramuscular injection. We report here that in vivo, we have obtained a sarcolemmal immunostaining in up to 50% of fibres of the injected muscle.
Large segmental duplications cover much of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Little is known about their origins. We show that they are primarily due to at least four different large-scale duplication events that occurred 100 to 200 million years ago, a formative period in the diversification of the angiosperms. A better understanding of the complex structural history of angiosperm genomes is necessary to make full use of Arabidopsis as a genetic model for other plant species.
Conventional heterogeneous dispersion polymerizations of unsaturated monomers are performed in either aqueous or organic dispersing media with the addition of interfacially active agents to stabilize the colloidal dispersion that forms. Successful stabilization of the polymer colloid during polymerization results in the formation of high molar mass polymers with high rates of polymerization. An environmentally responsible alternative to aqueous and organic dispersing media for heterogeneous dispersion polymerizations is described in which supercritical carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is used in conjunction with molecularly engineered free radical initiators and amphipathic molecules that are specifically designed to be interfacially active in CO(2). Conventional lipophilic monomers, exemplified by methyl methacrylate, can be quantitatively (>90 percent) polymerized heterogeneously to very high degrees of polymerization (>3000) in supercritical CO(2) in the presence of an added stabilizer to form kinetically stable dispersions that result in micrometer-sized particles with a narrow size distribution.
In rats with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (Brattleboro rats) the gene for the vasopressin precursor lacks a single G residue in the protein-coding region. The mutation gives rise to an open reading frame predicting a hormone precursor having a different C-terminus.
Many advanced snakes use fangs-specialized teeth associated with a venom gland-to introduce venom into prey or attacker. Various front- and rear-fanged groups are recognized, according to whether their fangs are positioned anterior (for example cobras and vipers) or posterior (for example grass snakes) in the upper jaw. A fundamental controversy in snake evolution is whether or not front and rear fangs share the same evolutionary and developmental origin. Resolving this controversy could identify a major evolutionary transition underlying the massive radiation of advanced snakes, and the associated developmental events. Here we examine this issue by visualizing the tooth-forming epithelium in the upper jaw of 96 snake embryos, covering eight species. We use the sonic hedgehog gene as a marker, and three-dimensionally reconstruct the development in 41 of the embryos. We show that front fangs develop from the posterior end of the upper jaw, and are strikingly similar in morphogenesis to rear fangs. This is consistent with their being homologous. In front-fanged snakes, the anterior part of the upper jaw lacks sonic hedgehog expression, and ontogenetic allometry displaces the fang from its posterior developmental origin to its adult front position-consistent with an ancestral posterior position of the front fang. In rear-fanged snakes, the fangs develop from an independent posterior dental lamina and retain their posterior position. In light of our findings, we put forward a new model for the evolution of snake fangs: a posterior subregion of the tooth-forming epithelium became developmentally uncoupled from the remaining dentition, which allowed the posterior teeth to evolve independently and in close association with the venom gland, becoming highly modified in different lineages. This developmental event could have facilitated the massive radiation of advanced snakes in the Cenozoic era, resulting in the spectacular diversity of snakes seen today.
Zooxanthellae are unicellular algae that occur as endosymbionts in many hundreds of marine invertebrate species. Because zooxanthellae have traditionally been difficult to classify, little is known about the natural history of these symbioses. Zooxanthellae were isolated from 131 individuals in 22 host taxa and characterized by the use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in nuclear genes that encode small ribosomal subunit RNA (ssRNA). Six algal RFLPs, distributed host species specifically, were detected. Individual hosts contained one algal RFLP. Zooxanthella phylogenetic relationships were estimated from 22 algal ssRNA sequences-one from each host species. Closely related algae were found in dissimilar hosts, suggesting that animal and algal lineages have maintained a flexible evolutionary relation with each other.
Cigarette, cigar, and pipe tobaccos contain Alternaria spores and dematiaceous mycelia, with cigarette tobaccos being more heavily laden. A smoke aerosol generated from hay on which the fungus had been cultured caused, among other pathologic changes, pulmonary emphysema in mice.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which afflicts about 1% of the world population, is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology that primarily affects the synovial membranes of multiple joints. Although CD4(+) T cells seem to be the prime mediators of RA, it remains unclear how arthritogenic CD4(+) T cells are generated and activated. Given that highly self-reactive T-cell clones are deleted during normal T-cell development in the thymus, abnormality in T-cell selection has been suspected as one cause of autoimmune disease. Here we show that a spontaneous point mutation of the gene encoding an SH2 domain of ZAP-70, a key signal transduction molecule in T cells, causes chronic autoimmune arthritis in mice that resembles human RA in many aspects. Altered signal transduction from T-cell antigen receptor through the aberrant ZAP-70 changes the thresholds of T cells to thymic selection, leading to the positive selection of otherwise negatively selected autoimmune T cells. Thymic production of arthritogenic T cells due to a genetically determined selection shift of the T-cell repertoire towards high self-reactivity might also be crucial to the development of disease in a subset of patients with RA.
Retinoic acid has profound effects on vertebrate limb morphogenesis (refs 1-6, reviewed in refs 7-9), including in the mouse, where it can act as a teratogen generating phocomelia and bone defects. A retinoic acid gradient, possibly amplified by a graded distribution of cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP), could provide positional information across the antero-posterior axis of the chick limb bud. The discovery of nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) acting as retinoic acid-inducible enhancer factors provided a basis for understanding how retinoic acid signals could be transduced at the level of gene expression. We have now used in situ hybridization to study the distribution of messenger RNA transcripts of the three murine receptors (mRARs) and CRABP during mouse limb development. Both mRAR alpha and mRAR gamma transcripts, but not those for mRAR beta, are present and uniformly distributed in the limb bud at day 10 post-coitum, whereas CRABP transcripts have a graded proximo-distal distribution, indicating that differential expression of CRABP, but not of mRAR alpha or mRAR gamma, could participate in the establishment of the morphogenetic field. At later stages, mRAR gamma transcripts become specific to the cartilage cell lineage and to the differentiating skin and mRAR beta transcripts are mostly restricted to the interdigital mesenchyme. CRABP transcripts, however, are excluded from regions expressing mRAR gamma and mRAR beta. These results indicate that all three RARs and CRABP have specific functions during morphogenesis and differentiation of the mouse limb.
Much of our present knowledge of the biological processes involved in pattern formation in Drosophila is derived from segmentation analysis. Comparatively little is known about the genetic requirement and mechanisms underlying the formation and separation of germ layers by morphogenetic movements during gastrulation. Here we show that the Drosophila gene huckebein (hkb), a member of the gap-gene class of segmentation genes, is required for germ-layer formation at blastoderm. Absence of the hkb product, an Sp1/egr-like zinc-finger protein, causes the ectodermal and mesodermal primordia to expand at the expense of endoderm anlagen. Conversely, ectopic expression of hkb inhibits the formation of the major gastrulation fold which gives rise to the mesoderm and prevents normal segmentation in the ectoderm. Thus, hkb is necessary for endoderm development and its activity defines spatial limits within the blastoderm embryo in which the germ layers are established.
Seedlings of Prunus avium and P. cerasus, grown from seed of infected trees, showed symptoms of cherry necrotic rusty mottle and sour cherry yellows diseases. No virus could be detected in the P. avium seedlings showing virus-like symptoms and only 10 percent of the 30 percent of P. cerasus seedlings showing symptoms contained virus. These results suggest that viruses may induce certain genetic abnormalities.
The rational design of drugs that can inhibit the action of viral proteases depends on obtaining accurate structures of these enzymes. The crystal structure of chemically synthesized HIV-1 protease has been determined at 2.8 angstrom resolution (R factor of 0.184) with the use of a model based on the Rous sarcoma virus protease structure. In this enzymatically active protein, the cysteines were replaced by alpha-amino-n-butyric acid, a nongenetically coded amino acid. This structure, in which all 99 amino acids were located, differs in several important details from that reported previously by others. The interface between the identical subunits forming the active protease dimer is composed of four well-ordered beta strands from both the amino and carboxyl termini and residues 86 to 94 have a helical conformation. The observed arrangement of the dimer interface suggests possible designs for dimerization inhibitors.
Nuclear transplantation in the mouse embryo was achieved by using a method that combines microsurgical removal of the zygote pronuclei with the introduction of a donor nucleus by a virus-mediated cell fusion technique. Survival of embryos was greater than 90 per cent in tests of this procedure. The embryos developed to term at a frequency not significantly different from that of nonmanipulated control embryos. Because nuclei and cytoplasm from genetically distinct inbred mouse strains can be efficiently interchanged, this procedure may be useful in characterizing possible cytoplasmic contributions to the embryonic and adult phenotype.
Gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) in mammalian cells using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) has become a valuable genetic tool. Here, we report the construction and application of a shRNA expression library targeting 9,610 human and 5,563 mouse genes. This library is presently composed of about 28,000 sequence-verified shRNA expression cassettes contained within multi-functional vectors, which permit shRNA cassettes to be packaged in retroviruses, tracked in mixed cell populations by means of DNA 'bar codes', and shuttled to customized vectors by bacterial mating. In order to validate the library, we used a genetic screen designed to report defects in human proteasome function. Our results suggest that our large-scale RNAi library can be used in specific, genetic applications in mammals, and will become a valuable resource for gene analysis and discovery.
Effects of susceptibility variants may depend on from which parent they are inherited. Although many associations between sequence variants and human traits have been discovered through genome-wide associations, the impact of parental origin has largely been ignored. Here we show that for 38,167 Icelanders genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips, the parental origin of most alleles can be determined. For this we used a combination of genealogy and long-range phasing. We then focused on SNPs that associate with diseases and are within 500 kilobases of known imprinted genes. Seven independent SNP associations were examined. Five-one with breast cancer, one with basal-cell carcinoma and three with type 2 diabetes-have parental-origin-specific associations. These variants are located in two genomic regions, 11p15 and 7q32, each harbouring a cluster of imprinted genes. Furthermore, we observed a novel association between the SNP rs2334499 at 11p15 and type 2 diabetes. Here the allele that confers risk when paternally inherited is protective when maternally transmitted. We identified a differentially methylated CTCF-binding site at 11p15 and demonstrated correlation of rs2334499 with decreased methylation of that site.
The diseases of asthma, eczema and hay fever are typified by reactions to common allergens, which are mediated by immunoglobulin E. These allergic diseases are increasing in prevalence, and are now a major source of disability throughout the developed world. They are the result of complex interactions between largely unknown genetic and environmental mechanisms. The identification of the environmental factors offers the real possibility of prevention of disease, and unravelling the genetics of allergic illnesses is likely to change their classification and treatment. Early life seems particularly important, when the initiation of allergic disease may result from genetic and environmental modification of the immune interaction between mother and child.
Modern crises present decision makers with many agonizing management choices. Very often a crisis manager is confronted with a plethora of conflicting information and given very little time to choose an appropriate course of action. Although contemporary methods of systems analysis have been used in attempts to organize data and clarify options, they have generally been of little use in presenting an accurate picture of an opponent's values and perceptions. Thus it is clear that we must now make use of the improved communications and technological devices at our disposal if crises are to be avoided or resolved with minimum damage. Our proposal to establish international model-oriented computer-assisted conferences is designed to promote greater cooperation and understanding among scientists and crisis managers of differing nations by enabling them to share images of themselves and one another. With better information and more rational options available, the chances of catastrophic misunderstanding or miscalculation can be meaningfully reduced. We have proposed a possible scenario for the initial implementation of such a system to combat famine, and hope that the same approach might be used in other areas over time. The ultimate goal is a system by which specialists of all persuasions cooperate so that international crises will be resolved on the bases of mutual benefits without resort to armed conflict.
Interleukin-4 (IL-4), a pleiotropic cytokine, is a major regulator of the immune system and is considered crucial for the development of T helper cell type 2 (TH2) responses. The susceptibility of BALB/c mice to infection with Leishmania major has been associated with a polarized TH2 response and an inability to down-modulate IL-4 production. The role of IL-4 in vivo was examined directly by disrupting the IL-4 gene in BALB/c embryonic stem cells. Despite the absence of IL-4, the genetically pure BALB/c mutant mice remained susceptible to L. major infection, showed no signs of lesion healing or parasite clearance, and did not switch to a TH1 phenotype.
Blue light regulates processes such as the development of plants and fungi and the behaviour of microbes. Two types of blue-light receptor flavoprotein have been identified: cryptochromes, which have partial similarity to photolyases, and phototropins, which are photoregulated protein kinases. The former have also been found in animals with evidence of essential roles in circadian rhythms. Euglena gracilis, a unicellular flagellate, abruptly changes its swimming direction after a sudden increase or decrease in incident blue light intensity, that is, step-up or step-down photophobic responses, resulting in photoavoidance or photoaccumulation, respectively. Although these photobehaviours of Euglena have been studied for a century, the photoreceptor molecules mediating them have remained unknown. Here we report the discovery and biochemical characterization of a new type of blue-light receptor flavoprotein, photoactivated adenylyl cyclase, in the photoreceptor organelle of Euglena gracilis, with molecular genetic evidence that it mediates the step-up photophobic response.
Domestication promotes rapid phenotypic evolution through artificial selection. We investigated the genetic history by which the wild grass teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) was domesticated into modern maize (Z. mays ssp. mays). Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 774 genes indicates that 2 to 4% of these genes experienced artificial selection. The remaining genes retain evidence of a population bottleneck associated with domestication. Candidate selected genes with putative function in plant growth are clustered near quantitative trait loci that contribute to phenotypic differences between maize and teosinte. If we assume that our sample of genes is representative, approximately 1200 genes throughout the maize genome have been affected by artificial selection.
Theories about the origin of AIDS all suffer from a dearth of data. For more than a decade, researchers have recognized the close genetic links between SIV from sooty mangabeys and HIV-2, a type of the virus that is mostly confined to west African countries, but to date, there are scant data that closely link HIV-1, the predominant human AIDS virus, to SIVs found in primates.
Although sexual isolation is one of the most important causes of speciation, its genetic basis is largely unknown. Here evidence is presented that suggests that sexual isolation between two closely related species of Drosophila is largely caused by differences in female cuticular hydrocarbons. This difference maps to only one of the three major chromosomes, implying that reproductive isolation might have a fairly simple genetic basis. The effect of the hydrocarbons on courtship may help explain the ubiquitous asymmetry of sexual isolation between many pairs of Drosophila species.
To study the genetic basis of natural variation in gene expression, we previously carried out genome-wide linkage analysis and mapped the determinants of approximately 1,000 expression phenotypes. In the present study, we carried out association analysis with dense sets of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from the International HapMap Project. For 374 phenotypes, the association study was performed with markers only from regions with strong linkage evidence; these regions all mapped close to the expressed gene. For a subset of 27 phenotypes, analysis of genome-wide association was performed with >770,000 markers. The association analysis with markers under the linkage peaks confirmed the linkage results and narrowed the candidate regulatory regions for many phenotypes with strong linkage evidence. The genome-wide association analysis yielded highly significant results that point to the same locations as the genome scans for about 50% of the phenotypes. For one candidate determinant, we carried out functional analyses and confirmed the variation in cis-acting regulatory activity. Our findings suggest that association studies with dense SNP maps will identify susceptibility loci or other determinants for some complex traits or diseases.
A survey of the dog genome sequence (6.22 million sequence reads; 1.5x coverage) demonstrates the power of sample sequencing for comparative analysis of mammalian genomes and the generation of species-specific resources. More than 650 million base pairs (>25%) of dog sequence align uniquely to the human genome, including fragments of putative orthologs for 18,473 of 24,567 annotated human genes. Mutation rates, conserved synteny, repeat content, and phylogeny can be compared among human, mouse, and dog. A variety of polymorphic elements are identified that will be valuable for mapping the genetic basis of diseases and traits in the dog.
DNA ends exposed after introduction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) undergo 5'-3' nucleolytic degradation to generate single-stranded DNA, the substrate for binding by the Rad51 protein to initiate homologous recombination. This process is poorly understood in eukaryotes, but several factors have been implicated, including the Mre11 complex (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/NBS1), Sae2/CtIP/Ctp1 and Exo1. Here we demonstrate that yeast Exo1 nuclease and Sgs1 helicase function in alternative pathways for DSB processing. Novel, partially resected intermediates accumulate in a double mutant lacking Exo1 and Sgs1, which are poor substrates for homologous recombination. The early processing step that generates partly resected intermediates is dependent on Sae2. When Sae2 is absent, in addition to Exo1 and Sgs1, unprocessed DSBs accumulate and homology-dependent repair fails. These results suggest a two-step mechanism for DSB processing during homologous recombination. First, the Mre11 complex and Sae2 remove a small oligonucleotide(s) from the DNA ends to form an early intermediate. Second, Exo1 and/or Sgs1 rapidly process this intermediate to generate extensive tracts of single-stranded DNA that serve as substrate for Rad51.
Although glucocorticoids and progestins control vastly different physiological processes, the receptors mediating the effects of these hormones interact with the same DNA sequences. Transfer experiments involving synthetic genes and in vitro binding studies have shown that progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors both recognize the same 15-base pair DNA element (TGTACAGGATGTTCT), raising the question of how the two steroids affect gene expression selectively. We considered the possibility that their selectivity arises from either the differential expression of the receptors in target cells or the differential dependence of receptor function on additional transcription factors. To test these alternatives we introduced a progesterone-receptor expression plasmid into the rat hepatoma cell line Fto2B-3 which contains glucocorticoid receptor but is devoid of progesterone receptor. We report that expression of the progesterone receptor in Fto2B-3 cells renders endogenous glucocorticoid-regulated genes inducible by progestins. Our data show that the responsiveness of a cell to external stimuli can be reprogrammed by the expression of a single transcription factor and that differential expression of hormone receptors is at least one mechanism by which steroid-specific gene activation is achieved.
We have constructed a high-resolution clone map of human chromosome 22 which integrates the available physical and genetic information, establishing a single consensus. The map consists of all classes of DNA landmarks ordered on 705 yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) at an average landmark density of more than one per 70 kilobases. This map represents the practical limits of currently available YAC resources and provides the basis for determination of the entire gene content and genomic DNA sequence of human chromosome 22.
Spontaneous thymic leukaemia in experimental mice is the result of a complex series of genetically controlled events. An important step in this process involves the production by thymocytes of recombinant polytropic retroviruses (MCF viruses). These leukaemogenic agents arise by recombination of genes from the env regions of endogenous precursor viruses. Sequences in these regions encode the envelope glycoprotein gp70 (ref. 6). Thus far, each cloned isolate of recombinant virus from AKR and HRS/J mice has been found to possess unique oligonucleotide sequences in its env region, as well as clone-specific peptides in its gp70 (refs 7,8). Therefore, the polytropic viruses of these leukaemia-susceptible mice are extremely diverse. These findings suggest that random recombination of env genes gives rise to leukaemogenic polytropic viruses. McGrath and Weissman have proposed that thymocytes with cell surface receptors for the gp70 of a particular leukaemogenic virus are the target cells for malignant transformation by that specific virus. In view of the diversity of polytropic viral gp70, their hypothesis would predict extensive phenotypic diversity among spontaneous thymic leukaemias. In contrast, leukaemias induced by a particular leukaemogenic recombinant virus would always have the same phenotype. Here we verify these predictions experimentally.
Selective autophagy involves the recognition and targeting of specific cargo, such as damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, or invading pathogens for lysosomal destruction. Yeast genetic screens have identified proteins required for different forms of selective autophagy, including cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting, pexophagy and mitophagy, and mammalian genetic screens have identified proteins required for autophagy regulation. However, there have been no systematic approaches to identify molecular determinants of selective autophagy in mammalian cells. Here, to identify mammalian genes required for selective autophagy, we performed a high-content, image-based, genome-wide small interfering RNA screen to detect genes required for the colocalization of Sindbis virus capsid protein with autophagolysosomes. We identified 141 candidate genes required for viral autophagy, which were enriched for cellular pathways related to messenger RNA processing, interferon signalling, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal motor function and metabolism. Ninety-six of these genes were also required for Parkin-mediated mitophagy, indicating that common molecular determinants may be involved in autophagic targeting of viral nucleocapsids and autophagic targeting of damaged mitochondria. Murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking one of these gene products, the C2-domain containing protein, SMURF1, are deficient in the autophagosomal targeting of Sindbis and herpes simplex viruses and in the clearance of damaged mitochondria. Moreover, SMURF1-deficient mice accumulate damaged mitochondria in the heart, brain and liver. Thus, our study identifies candidate determinants of selective autophagy, and defines SMURF1 as a newly recognized mediator of both viral autophagy and mitophagy.
Diatoms are a key component of marine ecosystems and are extremely important for the biogeochemical cycling of silica and as contributors to global fixed carbon. However, the answers to fundamental questions such as what diatoms can sense in their environment, how they respond to external signals, and what factors control their life strategies are largely unknown. We generated transgenic diatom cells containing the calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin to determine whether changes in calcium homeostasis are used to respond to relevant environmental stimuli. Our results reveal sensing systems for detecting and responding to fluid motion (shear stress), osmotic stress, and iron, a key nutrient that controls diatom abundance in the ocean.
Origins of replication have been identified in the DNA of viruses, mitochondria, bacterial plasmids and the bacterial chromosome. However, origins of replication of eukaryote chromosomes have remained elusive because of the large size and sequence complexity of chromosomes and in particular for want of a suitable assay for their detection. Recent development of techniques for genetic transformation of yeast by autonomously replicating cytoplasmic plasmids now makes it possible to search for eukaryote origins in a manner analogous to that used for bacteria. Here we describe the construction and properties of a plasmid which contains no effective eukaryote replication origin and whose efficiency of replication in yeast is greatly enhanced by insertion of certain fragments of yeast chromosomal DNA. We believe these to contain replication origins, since yeast transformants are shown to contain copies of the transforming plasmids.
Insectivorous bats have influenced the development of antipredator behavior in moths, green lacewings, crickets, and mantids; until recently, such adaptations were unknown in katydids. Foliage-gleaning bats in Panama can use the female-attracting, airborne calling songs of nocturnal katydids to locate prey. They also feed heavily on these insects. Katydid species sympatric with these bats exhibit markedly reduced calling song duty cycles. Males supplement shortened songs with complex, species-specific tremulations that generate vibrations that are inaudible to bats but reach conspecific females through a shared plant substrate. Female katydids do not call audibly but are also preyed on in large numbers, perhaps as a result of moving toward calling males.
Whole-genome sequence assemblies are now available for seven different animals, including nematode worms, mice and humans. Comparative genome analyses reveal a surprising constancy in genetic content: vertebrate genomes have only about twice the number of genes that invertebrate genomes have, and the increase is primarily due to the duplication of existing genes rather than the invention of new ones. How, then, has evolutionary diversity arisen? Emerging evidence suggests that organismal complexity arises from progressively more elaborate regulation of gene expression.
Elasmobranch fishes, the coelacanth, estivating lungfish, amphibians, and mammals synthesize urea by the ornithine-urea cycle; by comparison, urea synthetic activity is generally insignificant in teleostean fishes. It is reported here that isolated liver cells of two teleost toadfishes, Opsanus beta and Opsansus tau, synthesize urea by the ornithine-urea cycle at substantial rates. Because toadfish excrete ammonia, do not use urea as an osmolyte, and have substantial levels of urease in their digestive systems, urea may serve as a transient nitrogen store, forming the basis of a nitrogen conservation shuttle system between liver and gut as in ruminants and hibernators. Toadfish synthesize urea using enzymes and subcellular distributions similar to those of elasmobranchs: glutamine-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthethase (CPS III) and mitochondrial arginase. In contrast, mammals have CPS I (ammonia-dependent) and cytosolic arginase. Data on CPS and arginases in other fishes, including lungfishes and the coelacanth, support the hypothesis that the ornithine-urea cycle, a monophyletic trait in the vertebrates, underwent two key changes before the evolution of the extant lungfishes: a switch from CPS III to CPS I and replacement of mitochondrial arginase by a cytosolic equivalent.
Contraction of a vertebrate skeletal muscle fibre is triggered by electrical depolarization of sarcolemmal infoldings termed transverse-tubules (t-tubules), which in turn causes the release of calcium from an internal store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The mechanism that links t-tubular depolarization to SR calcium release remains poorly understood. In principle, this link might be provided by the prominent slow calcium current that has been described in skeletal muscle cells of adult frogs and rats. However, blocking this current does not abolish the depolarization-induced contractile responses of frog muscle, and the function of this slow calcium current is unknown. Here we describe measurements of calcium currents in developing skeletal muscle cells of normal rats and mice, and of mice with muscular dysgenesis, a mutation that causes excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling to fail. We find that a slow calcium current is present in skeletal muscle cells of normal animals but absent from skeletal muscle cells of mutant animals. The effect of the mutation is specific to the slow calcium current of skeletal muscle; a fast calcium current is present in developing skeletal muscle cells of both normal and mutant animals, and slow calcium currents are present in cardiac and sensory neurones of mutant animals. We believe this to be the first report of a mutation affecting calcium currents in a multicellular organism. The effects of the mutation raise important questions about the relationship between the slow calcium current and skeletal muscle E-C coupling.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized primarily by retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal malformations and learning disabilities. Although five BBS genes have been cloned, the molecular basis of this syndrome remains elusive. Here we show that BBS is probably caused by a defect at the basal body of ciliated cells. We have cloned a new BBS gene, BBS8, which encodes a protein with a prokaryotic domain, pilF, involved in pilus formation and twitching mobility. In one family, a homozygous null BBS8 mutation leads to BBS with randomization of left-right body axis symmetry, a known defect of the nodal cilium. We have also found that BBS8 localizes specifically to ciliated structures, such as the connecting cilium of the retina and columnar epithelial cells in the lung. In cells, BBS8 localizes to centrosomes and basal bodies and interacts with PCM1, a protein probably involved in ciliogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that all available Caenorhabditis elegans BBS homologues are expressed exclusively in ciliated neurons, and contain regulatory elements for RFX, a transcription factor that modulates the expression of genes associated with ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport.
Developmental, genetic and molecular studies indicate that multiple intercellular signalling systems interact to specify the types and spatial patterns of cells generated during the formation of the vulva of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Two classes of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptors and a Ras protein function in these signalling systems. The biology of vulval development provides a framework for understanding how cell interactions control the development of animals as diverse as nematodes, insects and mammals.
Prochlorococcus ecotypes are a useful system for exploring the origin and function of diversity among closely related microbes. The genetic variability between phenotypically distinct strains that differ by less that 1% in 16S ribosomal RNA sequences occurs mostly in genomic islands. Island genes appear to have been acquired in part by phage-mediated lateral gene transfer, and some are differentially expressed under light and nutrient stress. Furthermore, genome fragments directly recovered from ocean ecosystems indicate that these islands are variable among cooccurring Prochlorococcus cells. Genomic islands in this free-living photoautotroph share features with pathogenicity islands of parasitic bacteria, suggesting a general mechanism for niche differentiation in microbial species.
Successive adaptive radiations have played a pivotal role in the evolution of biological diversity. The effects of adaptive radiation are often seen, but the underlying causes are difficult to disentangle and remain unclear. Here we examine directly the role of ecological opportunity and competition in driving genetic diversification. We use the common aerobic bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, which evolves rapidly under novel environmental conditions to generate a large repertoire of mutants. When provided with ecological opportunity (afforded by spatial structure), identical populations diversify morphologically, but when ecological opportunity is restricted there is no such divergence. In spatially structured environments, the evolution of variant morphs follows a predictable sequence and we show that competition among the newly evolved niche-specialists maintains this variation. These results demonstrate that the elementary processes of mutation and selection alone are sufficient to promote rapid proliferation of new designs and support the theory that trade-offs in competitive ability drive adaptive radiation.
Studies of nitric oxide over the past two decades have highlighted the fundamental importance of gaseous signaling molecules in biology and medicine. The physiological role of other gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is now receiving increasing attention. Here we show that H2S is physiologically generated by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and that genetic deletion of this enzyme in mice markedly reduces H2S levels in the serum, heart, aorta, and other tissues. Mutant mice lacking CSE display pronounced hypertension and diminished endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. CSE is physiologically activated by calcium-calmodulin, which is a mechanism for H2S formation in response to vascular activation. These findings provide direct evidence that H2S is a physiologic vasodilator and regulator of blood pressure.
The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and its relatives are unique among animals in having operons. Operons are regulated multigene transcription units, in which polycistronic pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA coding for multiple peptides) is processed to monocistronic mRNAs. This occurs by 3' end formation and trans-splicing using the specialized SL2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle for downstream mRNAs. Previously, the correlation between downstream location in an operon and SL2 trans-splicing has been strong, but anecdotal. Although only 28 operons have been reported, the complete sequence of the C. elegans genome reveals numerous gene clusters. To determine how many of these clusters represent operons, we probed full-genome microarrays for SL2-containing mRNAs. We found significant enrichment for about 1,200 genes, including most of a group of several hundred genes represented by complementary DNAs that contain SL2 sequence. Analysis of their genomic arrangements indicates that >90% are downstream genes, falling in 790 distinct operons. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes. Numerous examples of co-transcription of genes encoding functionally related proteins are evident. Inspection of the operon list should reveal previously unknown functional relationships.
Migration is an important factor in the biological evolution of human populations, and surnames provide one of the simplest records of identification. The distribution of surnames can supply quantitative information on the structure of human populations. Surnames considered as alleles of a gene transmitted only by the male line can be assumed to be neutral markers and therefore satisfy the expectations of the neutral theory of evolution, which is entirely described by random genetic drift, mutation and migration. As data on surnames are easier to collect than those from genes, the information yield is potentially increased, but the validity of the conclusions must be tested in actual samples. The purpose of this report is to compare the estimates of migration rates in Italy, as inferred by the surname distribution found in the telephone directories and other sources, with the corresponding estimates from official demographic sources. Our findings show that in these samples the ratio of surnames to individuals makes it possible to calculate reliable estimates of migration rates.
How tissues generate and maintain the correct number of cells is a fundamental problem in biology. In principle, tissue turnover can occur by the differentiation of stem cells, as is well documented for blood, skin and intestine, or by the duplication of existing differentiated cells. Recent work on adult stem cells has highlighted their potential contribution to organ maintenance and repair. However, the extent to which stem cells actually participate in these processes in vivo is not clear. Here we introduce a method for genetic lineage tracing to determine the contribution of stem cells to a tissue of interest. We focus on pancreatic beta-cells, whose postnatal origins remain controversial. Our analysis shows that pre-existing beta-cells, rather than pluripotent stem cells, are the major source of new beta-cells during adult life and after pancreatectomy in mice. These results suggest that terminally differentiated beta-cells retain a significant proliferative capacity in vivo and cast doubt on the idea that adult stem cells have a significant role in beta-cell replenishment.
SPINAL muscular atrophy (SMA) describes a group of heritable degenerative diseases that selectively affect the alpha-motor neuron. Childhood-onset SMAs rank second in frequency to cystic fibrosis among autosomal recessive disorders, and are the leading cause of heritable infant mortality. Predictions that genetic heterogeneity underlies the differences between types of SMA, together with the aggressive nature of the most-severe infantile form, make linkage analysis of SMA potentially complex. We have now analysed 13 clinically heterogeneous SMA families. We find that 'chronic' childhood-onset SMA (including intermediate SMA or SMA type II, and Kugelberg-Welander or SMA type III) is genetically homogeneous, mapping to chromosomal region 5q11.2-13.3.
Ribonucleotide reductase, an essential enzyme for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, is formed by the association of two nonidentical subunits in almost all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The same model probably holds for the herpes simplex virus (HSV)-encoded ribonucleotide reductase; two polypeptides of relative molecular mass 136,000 (136K; H1) and 40K (H2) (referred to elsewhere as RR1 and RR2; see for example, Dutia et al.) have been associated with the viral enzyme by both genetic and immunological studies. Furthermore, DNA sequence analyses have shown significant stretches of amino-acid homology between these viral polypeptides and those of, respectively, subunit 1 (ref. 12) and subunit 2 (ref. 13) of the Escherichia coli and mammalian enzymes. To assess the involvement of the 40K polypeptide in reductase activity, we synthesized a nonapeptide corresponding to the sequence of its carboxy terminus with the intention of raising neutralizing antibodies specific for the viral activity (E.A.C. et al., in preparation). We report here the unexpected finding that the nonapeptide itself specifically inhibits the HSV ribonucleotide reductase activity in a reversible, non-competitive manner, and we suggest that it does this by impairment of the correct association of the two subunits. This phenomenon emphasizes the potential usefulness of synthetic peptides in probing critical sites involved in macromolecular interactions.
X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals allows dosage compensation for X-linked gene products between the sexes. The developmental regulation of this process has been extensively investigated in mice, where the X chromosome of paternal origin (Xp) is silenced during early embryogenesis owing to imprinted expression of the regulatory RNA, Xist (X-inactive specific transcript). Paternal XCI is reversed in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst and random XCI subsequently occurs in epiblast cells. Here we show that other eutherian mammals have very different strategies for initiating XCI. In rabbits and humans, the Xist homologue is not subject to imprinting and XCI begins later than in mice. Furthermore, Xist is upregulated on both X chromosomes in a high proportion of rabbit and human embryo cells, even in the inner cell mass. In rabbits, this triggers XCI on both X chromosomes in some cells. In humans, chromosome-wide XCI has not initiated even by the blastocyst stage, despite the upregulation of XIST. The choice of which X chromosome will finally become inactive thus occurs downstream of Xist upregulation in both rabbits and humans, unlike in mice. Our study demonstrates the remarkable diversity in XCI regulation and highlights differences between mammals in their requirement for dosage compensation during early embryogenesis.
Harlequin (Hq) mutant mice have progressive degeneration of terminally differentiated cerebellar and retinal neurons. We have identified the Hq mutation as a proviral insertion in the apoptosis-inducing factor (Aif) gene, causing about an 80% reduction in AIF expression. Mutant cerebellar granule cells are susceptible to exogenous and endogenous peroxide-mediated apoptosis, but can be rescued by AIF expression. Overexpression of AIF in wild-type granule cells further decreases peroxide-mediated cell death, suggesting that AIF serves as a free radical scavenger. In agreement, dying neurons in aged Hq mutant mice show oxidative stress. In addition, neurons damaged by oxidative stress in both the cerebellum and retina of Hq mutant mice re-enter the cell cycle before undergoing apoptosis. Our results provide a genetic model of oxidative stress-mediated neurodegeneration and demonstrate a direct connection between cell cycle re-entry and oxidative stress in the ageing central nervous system.
The overexpression of defined transcription factors in somatic cells results in their reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The extremely low efficiency and slow kinetics of in vitro reprogramming suggest that further rare events are required to generate iPS cells. The nature and identity of these events, however, remain elusive. We noticed that the reprogramming potential of primary murine fibroblasts into iPS cells decreases after serial passaging and the concomitant onset of senescence. Consistent with the notion that loss of replicative potential provides a barrier for reprogramming, here we show that cells with low endogenous p19(Arf) (encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus, also known as Cdkn2a locus) protein levels and immortal fibroblasts deficient in components of the Arf-Trp53 pathway yield iPS cell colonies with up to threefold faster kinetics and at a significantly higher efficiency than wild-type cells, endowing almost every somatic cell with the potential to form iPS cells. Notably, the acute genetic ablation of Trp53 (also known as p53) in cellular subpopulations that normally fail to reprogram rescues their ability to produce iPS cells. Our results show that the acquisition of immortality is a crucial and rate-limiting step towards the establishment of a pluripotent state in somatic cells and underscore the similarities between induced pluripotency and tumorigenesis.
Hybrid species of fungal pathogens that infect wild and cultivated plants are emerging with new virulence and host ranges, posing a threat to agriculture and forestry. Here we show that the virulence of hybrid species of the basidiomycete fungus Heterobasidion annosum (Fr) Bref, a causal agent of root and butt rot in conifers and one of the most economically important forest pathogens, is controlled by their mitochondrial genome. Our results indicate that cooperation between organelles that contain genetic information may influence the phenotype of hybrid phytopathogens.
Biofilms are surface-attached microbial communities with characteristic architecture and phenotypic and biochemical properties distinct from their free-swimming, planktonic counterparts. One of the best-known of these biofilm-specific properties is the development of antibiotic resistance that can be up to 1,000-fold greater than planktonic cells. We report a genetic determinant of this high-level resistance in the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We have identified a mutant of P. aeruginosa that, while still capable of forming biofilms with the characteristic P. aeruginosa architecture, does not develop high-level biofilm-specific resistance to three different classes of antibiotics. The locus identified in our screen, ndvB, is required for the synthesis of periplasmic glucans. Our discovery that these periplasmic glucans interact physically with tobramycin suggests that these glucose polymers may prevent antibiotics from reaching their sites of action by sequestering these antimicrobial agents in the periplasm. Our results indicate that biofilms themselves are not simply a diffusion barrier to these antibiotics, but rather that bacteria within these microbial communities employ distinct mechanisms to resist the action of antimicrobial agents.
Post-translational modification of chromatin has profound effects on many biological processes including transcriptional regulation, heterochromatin organization, and X-chromosome inactivation. Recent studies indicate that methylation on specific histone lysine (K) residues participates in many of these processes. Lysine methylation occurs in three distinct states, having either one (me1), two (me2) or three (me3) methyl groups attached to the amine group of the lysine side chain. These differences in modification state have an important role in defining how methylated chromatin is recognized and interpreted. Until recently, histone lysine methylation was considered a stable modification, but the identification of histone demethylase enzymes has demonstrated the reversibility of this epigenetic mark. So far, all characterized histone demethylases show enzymatic activity towards lysine residues modified in the me1 or me2 state, leaving open the possibility that me3 constitutes an irreversible modification. Here we demonstrate that JHDM3A (jumonji C (JmjC)-domain-containing histone demethylase 3A; also known as JMJD2A) is capable of removing the me3 group from modified H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3 lysine 36 (H3K36). Overexpression of JHDM3A abrogates recruitment of HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) to heterochromatin, indicating a role for JHDM3A in antagonizing methylated H3K9 nucleated events. siRNA-mediated knockdown of JHDM3A leads to increased levels of H3K9 methylation and upregulation of a JHDM3A target gene, ASCL2, indicating that JHDM3A may function in euchromatin to remove histone methylation marks that are associated with active transcription.
Thyristors are a class of nonlinear electronic device that exhibit bistable resistance--that is, they can be switched between two different conductance states. Thyristors are widely used as inverters (direct to alternating current converters) and for the smooth control of power in a variety of applications such as motors and refrigerators. Materials and structures that exhibit nonlinear resistance of this sort are not only useful for practical applications: they also provide systems for exploring fundamental aspects of solid-state and statistical physics. Here we report the discovery of a giant nonlinear resistance effect in the conducting organic salt theta-(BEDT-TTF)2CsCo(SCN)4, the voltage-current characteristics of which are essentially the same as those of a conventional thyristor. This intrinsic organic thyristor works as an inverter, generating an alternating current when a static direct-current voltage is applied. Whereas conventional thyristors consist of a series of diodes (their nonlinearity comes from interface effects at the p-n junctions), the present salt exhibits giant nonlinear resistance as a bulk phenomenon. We attribute the origin of this effect to the current-induced melting of insulating charge-order domains, an intrinsically non-equilibrium phenomenon in the sense that ordered domains are melted by a steady flow.
Humans are exposed to radiation through the environment and in medical settings. To deal with radiation-induced damage, cells mount complex responses that rely on changes in gene expression. These gene expression responses differ greatly between individuals and contribute to individual differences in response to radiation. Here we identify regulators that influence expression levels of radiation-responsive genes. We treated radiation-induced changes in gene expression as quantitative phenotypes, and conducted genetic linkage and association studies to map their regulators. For more than 1,200 of these phenotypes there was significant evidence of linkage to specific chromosomal regions. Nearly all of the regulators act in trans to influence the expression of their target genes; there are very few cis-acting regulators. Some of the trans-acting regulators are transcription factors, but others are genes that were not known to have a regulatory function in radiation response. These results have implications for our basic and clinical understanding of how human cells respond to radiation.
The torso (tor) gene, one of six identified maternal genes essential for the development of the anterior and posterior terminal structures in the Drosophila embryo, is likely to function as a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Although tor protein is uniformly distributed in the membrane of the egg cell and syncytial embryo, genetic and molecular data suggest that tor is locally activated at the ends of the embryo by a ligand present in the perivitelline space. Local activation of tor could be achieved if the ligand were expressed by a subpopulation of the follicle cells that surround the developing oocyte. Here we describe torso-like (tsl), the sixth member of the terminal gene class, and show that it is unique among these genes in that its expression is required in the somatic follicle cells rather than in the germ line. Moreover, mosaic analysis demonstrates that tsl expression is necessary only in subpopulations of follicle cells located at the poles of the oocyte. Thus, the spatially regulated expression of tsl in the follicle cell layer may generate a localized signal that is transduced by tor, ultimately resulting in the formation of the terminal structures of the embryo.
In situ hybridization of an oligonucleotide probe complementary to vasopressin messenger RNA (mRNA) in sections from normal or Brattleboro rat hypothalami revealed hybridization densities in each of three vasopressin-rich nuclei: the supraoptic, paraventricular, and suprachiasmatic. When entrained to a daily light-dark cycle, each rat strain displayed diurnal variation in hybridizable mRNA in the suprachiasmatic, but not in the supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei. The higher values for suprachiasmatic mRNA in the morning correlate well with previously elucidated morning increases in vasopressin immunoreactivity in the cerebrospinal fluid. These results support the utility of in situ hybridization techniques for elucidating physiological influences on regional peptidergic function, are consistent with a prominent role for vasopressinergic suprachiasmatic neurons in generating the cerebrospinal fluid vasopressin rhythm, and suggest that regulation of this mRNA rhythm is not dependent on release of intact peptide.
The FBXW7/hCDC4 gene encodes a ubiquitin ligase implicated in the control of chromosome stability. Here we identify the mouse Fbxw7 gene as a p53-dependent tumour suppressor gene by using a mammalian genetic screen for p53-dependent genes involved in tumorigenesis. Radiation-induced lymphomas from p53+/- mice, but not those from p53-/- mice, show frequent loss of heterozygosity and a 10% mutation rate of the Fbxw7 gene. Fbxw7+/- mice have greater susceptibility to radiation-induced tumorigenesis, but most tumours retain and express the wild-type allele, indicating that Fbxw7 is a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor gene. Loss of Fbxw7 alters the spectrum of tumours that develop in p53 deficient mice to include a range of tumours in epithelial tissues such as the lung, liver and ovary. Mouse embryo fibroblasts from Fbxw7-deficient mice, or wild-type mouse cells expressing Fbxw7 small interfering RNA, have higher levels of Aurora-A kinase, c-Jun and Notch4, but not of cyclin E. We propose that p53-dependent loss of Fbxw7 leads to genetic instability by mechanisms that might involve the activation of Aurora-A, providing a rationale for the early occurrence of these mutations in human cancers.
The structural mechanisms by which proteins have evolved new functions are known only indirectly. We report x-ray crystal structures of a resurrected ancestral protein-the approximately 450 million-year-old precursor of vertebrate glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors. Using structural, phylogenetic, and functional analysis, we identify the specific set of historical mutations that recapitulate the evolution of GR's hormone specificity from an MR-like ancestor. These substitutions repositioned crucial residues to create new receptor-ligand and intraprotein contacts. Strong epistatic interactions occur because one substitution changes the conformational position of another site. "Permissive" mutations-substitutions of no immediate consequence, which stabilize specific elements of the protein and allow it to tolerate subsequent function-switching changes-played a major role in determining GR's evolutionary trajectory.
Placoderms are extinct jawed fishes of the class Placodermi and are basal among jawed vertebrates. It is generally thought that teeth are absent in placoderms and that the phylogenetic origin of teeth occurred after the evolution of jaws. However, we now report the presence of tooth rows in more derived placoderms, the arthrodires. New teeth are composed of gnathostome-type dentine and develop at specific locations. Hence, it appears that these placoderm teeth develop and are regulated as in other jawed vertebrates. Because tooth development occurs only in derived forms of placoderms, we suggest that teeth evolved at least twice, through a mechanism of convergent evolution.
During embryogenesis, body pattern is established in a stepwise process. After specification of the body axis, the embryo is subdivided into smaller units. Within these units, a diverse array of cell types is then generated. The subdivisions of the Drosophila embryo, called parasegments, are defined by the interface between cells expressing the homeoprotein Engrailed and cells expressing the secreted protein Wingless. We have examined the generation of cell-type diversity within parasegments by focusing on the choice of cell fate made by the engrailed (en)-expressing cells. These cells differentiate as one of two alternative cell types. We report here that this choice is mediated by wingless (wg), in a function distinct from its early role maintaining en expression. Thus, en cells exhibit different responses to the wg signal at different developmental stages. Early wg input stabilizes the subdivision of the body axis by maintaining en expression, whereas later input generates cell-type diversity.
Isografts of heterotypic recombinants of embryonic mammary epithelium with salivary mesenchyme undergo development morphogenetically resembling that of salivary gland. However, cytodifferentiation of the epithelium is like that of mammary gland. In lactating hosts these isografts respond to endogenous hormonal stimulation and synthesize a milk protein, alpha-lactalbumin.
In coevolutionary 'arms races' between the sexes, the outcome of antagonistic interactions may remain at an evolutionary standstill. The advantage gained by one sex, with any evolutionary exaggeration of arms, is expected to be matched by analogous counteradaptations in the other sex. This fundamental coevolutionary process may thus be hidden from the evolutionist's eye, and no natural examples are known. We have studied the effects of male and female armament (clasping and anti-clasping morphologies) on the outcome of antagonistic mating interactions in 15 species of water strider, using a combination of experimental and phylogenetic comparative methods. Here we present, by assessing the independent effects of both species-specific level of arms escalation and small imbalances in the amounts of arms between the sexes within species, the consequences of a sexual arms race. Evolutionary change in the balance of armament between males and females, but not in the species-specific level of escalation, has resulted in evolutionary change in the outcome of sexually antagonistic interactions such as mating rate.
It is widely believed that gene flow connected many shallow water populations of the Caribbean and eastern Pacific until the Panama seaway closed 3.0 to 3.5 million years ago. Measurements of biochemical and reproductive divergence for seven closely related, transisthmian pairs of snapping shrimps (Alpheus) indicate, however, that isolation was staggered rather than simultaneous. The four least divergent pairs provide the best estimate for rates of molecular divergence and speciation. Ecological, genetic, and geological data suggest that gene flow was disrupted for the remaining three pairs by environmental change several million years before the land barrier was complete.
Disease of the kidney developed in breeding stock of Gunn rats. The renal lesion is the result of a new mutation. The genetic defect is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is apparently lethal in the homozygous condition. The abnormality manifests itself as a congenital hydronephrosis with related cystic changes in the kidney.
Transposable elements of DNA that are structurally defined and genetically discrete units seem to have an important role in the evolution of bacterial plasmids. Recombination occurring at the termini of such elements can result in the joining together of unrelated DNA segments that lack extensive nucleotide sequence homology. In addition, transposable elements serve as novel biological switches capable of turning on and off the expression of nearby genes as a consequence of their insertion into or excision from plasmid genomes.
Transcription of eukaryotic genes is performed by three nuclear RNA polymerases, of which RNA polymerase II is thought to be solely responsible for the synthesis of messenger RNAs. Here we show that transcription of some mRNAs in humans and rodents is mediated by a previously unknown single-polypeptide nuclear RNA polymerase (spRNAP-IV). spRNAP-IV is expressed from an alternative transcript of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase gene (POLRMT). The spRNAP-IV lacks 262 amino-terminal amino acids of mitochondrial RNA polymerase, including the mitochondrial-targeting signal, and localizes to the nucleus. Transcription by spRNAP-IV is resistant to the RNA polymease II inhibitor alpha-amanitin but is sensitive to short interfering RNA specific for the POLRMT gene. The promoters for spRNAP-IV differ substantially from those used by RNA polymerase II, do not respond to transcriptional enhancers and contain a common functional sequence motif.
Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most well studied genetic model organisms; nonetheless, its genome still contains unannotated coding and non-coding genes, transcripts, exons and RNA editing sites. Full discovery and annotation are pre-requisites for understanding how the regulation of transcription, splicing and RNA editing directs the development of this complex organism. Here we used RNA-Seq, tiling microarrays and cDNA sequencing to explore the transcriptome in 30 distinct developmental stages. We identified 111,195 new elements, including thousands of genes, coding and non-coding transcripts, exons, splicing and editing events, and inferred protein isoforms that previously eluded discovery using established experimental, prediction and conservation-based approaches. These data substantially expand the number of known transcribed elements in the Drosophila genome and provide a high-resolution view of transcriptome dynamics throughout development.
Light effects will produce the seasonal forms of Ascia monuste L. but they are not yet proved to be the only causative agent. The long-day form is melanic; the short-day form is white. Only females exhibit the effect. The capacity to form melanic females is most frequent in the Florida population and is probably genetically determined.
There are genetic differences within the major histocompatibility complex of the mouse which lead to skin graft rejection but which cannot be detected serologically. When confronted with these differences on allogeneic cells, lymphocytes proliferate in vitro. In other cases, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation but no skin graft rejection is associated with loci that are linked to but genetically separable from the loci controlling the serologically defined antigens.
Root nodules of leguminous plants are symbiotic organs in which Rhizobium bacteria fix nitrogen. Their formation requires the induction of a nodule meristem and the formation of a tubular structure, the infection thread, through which the rhizobia reach the nodule primordium. In the Rhizobium host plants pea and vetch, pre-infection thread structures always preceded the formation of infection threads. These structures consisted of cytoplasmic bridges traversing the central vacuole of outer cortical root cells, aligned in radial rows. In vetch, the site of the infection thread was determined by the plant rather than by the invading rhizobia. Like nodule primordia, pre-infection thread structures could be induced in the absence of rhizobia provided that mitogenic lipo-oligosaccharides produced by Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae were added to the plant. In this case, cells in the two outer cortical cell layers containing cytoplasmic bridges may have formed root hairs. A common morphogenetic pathway may be shared in the formation of root hairs and infection threads.
Archaeopteryx is widely accepted as being the most basal bird, and accordingly it is regarded as central to understanding avialan origins; however, recent discoveries of derived maniraptorans have weakened the avialan status of Archaeopteryx. Here we report a new Archaeopteryx-like theropod from China. This find further demonstrates that many features formerly regarded as being diagnostic of Avialae, including long and robust forelimbs, actually characterize the more inclusive group Paraves (composed of the avialans and the deinonychosaurs). Notably, adding the new taxon into a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis shifts Archaeopteryx to the Deinonychosauria. Despite only tentative statistical support, this result challenges the centrality of Archaeopteryx in the transition to birds. If this new phylogenetic hypothesis can be confirmed by further investigation, current assumptions regarding the avialan ancestral condition will need to be re-evaluated.
DNA sequence variants in specific genes or regions of the human genome are responsible for a variety of phenotypes such as disease risk or variable drug response. These variants can be investigated directly, or through their non-random associations with neighbouring markers (called linkage disequilibrium (LD)). Here we report measurement of LD along the complete sequence of human chromosome 22. Duplicate genotyping and analysis of 1,504 markers in Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) reference families at a median spacing of 15 kilobases (kb) reveals a highly variable pattern of LD along the chromosome, in which extensive regions of nearly complete LD up to 804 kb in length are interspersed with regions of little or no detectable LD. The LD patterns are replicated in a panel of unrelated UK Caucasians. There is a strong correlation between high LD and low recombination frequency in the extant genetic map, suggesting that historical and contemporary recombination rates are similar. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing genome-wide maps of LD.
D-type cyclins, in association with the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 or Cdk6, promote progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (RB). The activities of Cdk4 and Cdk6 are constrained by inhibitors such as p16, the product of the CDKN2 gene on human chromosome 9p21 (refs 12-14). The frequent deletion or mutation of CDKN2 in tumour cells suggests that p16 acts as a tumour suppressor. We show that wild-type p16 arrests normal diploid cells in late G1, whereas a tumour-associated mutant of p16 does not. Significantly, the ability of p16 to induce cell-cycle arrest is lost in cells lacking functional RB, including primary fibroblasts from Rb-/- mouse embryos. Thus, loss of p16, overexpression of D-cyclins and loss of RB have similar effects on G1 progression, and may represent a common pathway to tumorigenesis.
In 1997, the rediscovery of Sus bucculentus in Laos was announced by Groves et al.--this wild pig species had gone unrecorded since first being described in 1892. Although the identification of the new specimen was based initially on morphology, the authors also used a 7% sequence divergence from the common Eurasian pig S. scrofa (based on their analysis of 327 base pairs of the gene encoding mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA) as support for the species status of S. bucculentus. Concerned about the large divergence reported for a relatively conserved gene, and the absence of the sequence in any public database, we analysed an additional tissue sample from the specimen and found only 0.6% divergence from S. scrofa. Our more extensive analysis places the sample within the S. scrofa clade, calling into question the species status of S. bucculentus and demonstrating the need for both phylogenetic and morphological evidence in defining species.
The matrix of evolutionary distances is a model-based statistic, derived from molecular sequences, summarizing the pairwise phylogenetic relations between a collection of species. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction methods relying on this matrix are relatively fast and thus widely used in molecular systematics. However, because of their intrinsic reliance on summary statistics, distance-matrix methods are assumed to be less accurate than likelihood-based approaches. In this paper, pairwise sequence comparisons are shown to be more powerful than previously hypothesized. A statistical analysis of certain distance-based techniques indicates that their data requirement for large evolutionary trees essentially matches the conjectured performance of maximum likelihood methods--challenging the idea that summary statistics lead to suboptimal analyses. On the basis of a connection between ancestral state reconstruction and distance averaging, the critical role played by the covariances of the distance matrix is identified.
Three reports on mammalian brain evolution analyse the same comparative data on brain component volumes but come to partially conflicting conclusions. Clark et al. conclude from their analysis of volumetric brain proportions ("cerebro-types") that cerebellum size is invariant across mammalian taxonomic groups, the neocortex and cerebellum do not co-vary in size (in contradiction to ref. 1), and cerebrotype-based measures identify directional changes in brain architecture. Here I provide evidence that calls each of these conclusions into question. The failure of the cerebrotype measure to identify species differences in brain architecture that are independent of gross brain size undermines the proposal by Clark et al. that it could be useful for detecting evolutionary patterns and phylogenetic relationships.
Many-body systems in nature exhibit complexity and self-organization arising from seemingly simple laws. For example, the long-range Coulomb interaction between electrical charges has a simple form, yet is responsible for a plethora of bound states in matter, ranging from the hydrogen atom to complex biochemical structures. Semiconductors form an ideal laboratory for studying many-body interactions of electronic quasiparticles among themselves and with lattice vibrations and light. Oppositely charged electron and hole quasiparticles can coexist in an ionized but correlated plasma, or form bound hydrogen-like pairs called excitons. The pathways between such states, however, remain elusive in near-visible optical experiments that detect a subset of excitons with vanishing centre-of-mass momenta. In contrast, transitions between internal exciton levels, which occur in the far-infrared at terahertz (1012 s(-1)) frequencies, are independent of this restriction, suggesting their use as a probe of electron-hole pair dynamics. Here we employ an ultrafast terahertz probe to investigate directly the dynamical interplay of optically-generated excitons and unbound electron-hole pairs in GaAs quantum wells. Our observations reveal an unexpected quasi-instantaneous excitonic enhancement, the formation of insulating excitons on a 100-ps timescale, and the conditions under which excitonic populations prevail.
Polyploidy occurs in the heterosporous and homosporous Pteridophyta, but with a much higher frequency in the latter. Ninety-six percent of the homosporous Pteridophyta show a gametic chromosome number greater than 27, whereas 90 percent of the heterosporous ones possess a gametic chromosome number less than 28. Ultrafrequent establishment of poly- ploidy in the homosporous Pteridophy- ta appears to be necessary to create and maintain genetic variation in the face of the homozygotizing effects of habitual self-fertilization in the monoe- cious gametophytes of these plants.
A genetic recombinant within the major histocompatibility (B) complex of the chicken has revealed the chromosomal subregion effecting resistance to Marek's disease--a malignant lymphoma induced by a herpesvirus. The recombinant, BF21-G19, occurred spontaneously among the progeny of a male heterozygous for resistant BF21-G21 and susceptible BF19-G19 haplotypes. Exposure to Marek's disease of families segregating for the recombinant showed that this new F-G arrangement conferred a level of resistance equivalent to that of the resistant parental haplotype. Thus, a gene, or genes, within or closely linked to the B-F region of the B complex appears to be responsible for the observed resistance to Marek's disease.
Herbert et al. (Reports, 14 April 2006, p. 279) found that the rs7566605 genetic variant, located upstream of the INSIG2 gene, was consistently associated with increased body mass index. However, we found no evidence of association between rs7566605 and body mass index in two large ethnically homogeneous population-based cohorts. On the contrary, an opposite tendency was observed.
Following a recent suggestion that tooth enamel prism shape differs within Hominoidea, the teeth of a number of extinct and extant hominoid species were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The enamel prism patterns of some gracile and robust australopithecine specimens from Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, and Kromdraai are recorded. The characteristic arrangements of enamel prisms in all modern and extinct hominoid species were found to be essentially similar. The implications of enamel prisms for phylogenetic deduction in Hominoidea are discussed.
Gametic imprinting is a developmental process that induces parental-specific expression or repression of autosomal and X-chromosome-linked genes. The mouse Igf2r gene (encoding the receptor for insulin- like growth factor type-2) is imprinted and is expressed from the maternal allele after embryonic implantation. We previously proposed that methylation of region 2, a region rich in cytosine-guanine doublets (a 'CpG island') in the second intron of Igf2r, is the imprinting signal that maintains expression of the maternal allele. Here we use mouse transgenes to test the role of region 2 and the influence of chromosome location on Igf2r imprinting. Yeast artificial chromosome transgenes successfully reproduced the imprinted methylation and expression pattern of the endogenous Igf2r gene; deletion of region 2 from these transgenes caused a loss of imprinting and restored biallelic Igf2r expression. These results define a primary role for region 2 and a negligible role for chromosomal location in Igf2r imprinting; they also show that methylation imprints can maintain allelic expression. Short transgenes containing only region 2 and yeast artificial chromosome transgenes with an inactive Igf2r promoter do not attract parental-specific methylation. All transgenes showing paternal-specific repression of Igf2r produced an antisense RNA whose transcription was dependent on region 2. The production of an antisense RNA by the repressed parental allele is reminiscent of the imprinting of the Igf2/H19 gene pair and may indicate that expression competition could play a general role in imprinting.
The hydrophobic cores of proteins are generally well packed, with few cavities. Mutations in which a bulky buried residue such as leucine or phenylalanine is replaced with a small residue such as alanine can create cavities in the core of a protein (our unpublished results). The sizes and shapes of such cavities can vary substantially depending on factors such as local geometry, whether or not a cavity already exists at the site of substitution, and the degree to which the protein structure relaxes to occupy the space vacated by the substituted residue. We show by crystallographic and thermodynamic analysis that the cavity created by the replacement Leu 99----Ala in T4 lysozyme is large enough to bind benzene and that ligand binding increases the melting temperature of the protein by 6.0 degrees C at pH 3.0. Benzene does not, however, bind to the cavity created by the Phe 153----Ala replacement. The results show that cavities can be engineered in proteins and suggest that such cavities might be tailored to bind specific ligands. The binding of benzene at an internal site 7 A from the molecular surface also illustrates the dynamic nature of proteins, even in crystals.
Exposure of conjugating Tetrahymena to a hyperosmotic shock blocks the exchange of gametic nuclei and produces self-fertilized exconjugants that are homozygous for their whole genome. Cells are sensitive to this induction during a brief period after meiosis. The high efficiency of the treatment and the fertility of the progeny make this a useful method for the isolation of induced recessive mutations and enhances the value of Tetrahymena as an animal-cell model system in which genetic dissection is practical. The sharp peak of sensitivity is useful in the study of those cellular mechanisms responsible for the independent handling of several functionally distinct nuclei during conjugation.
Exogenous DNA sequences were introduced into the Drosophila germ line. A rosy transposon (ry1), constructed by inserting a chromosomal DNA fragment containing the wild-type rosy gene into a P transposable element, transformed germ line cells in 20 to 50 percent of the injected rosy mutant embryos. Transformants contained one or two copies of chromosomally integrated, intact ry1 that were stably inherited in subsequent generations. These transformed flies had wild-type eye color indicating that the visible genetic defect in the host strain could be fully and permanently corrected by the transferred gene. To demonstrate the generality of this approach, a DNA segment that does not confer a recognizable phenotype on recipients was also transferred into germ line chromosomes.
Many tumours are composed of genetically diverse cells; however, little is known about how diversity evolves or the impact that diversity has on functional properties. Here, using xenografting and DNA copy number alteration (CNA) profiling of human BCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukaemia, we demonstrate that genetic diversity occurs in functionally defined leukaemia-initiating cells and that many diagnostic patient samples contain multiple genetically distinct leukaemia-initiating cell subclones. Reconstructing the subclonal genetic ancestry of several samples by CNA profiling demonstrated a branching multi-clonal evolution model of leukaemogenesis, rather than linear succession. For some patient samples, the predominant diagnostic clone repopulated xenografts, whereas in others it was outcompeted by minor subclones. Reconstitution with the predominant diagnosis clone was associated with more aggressive growth properties in xenografts, deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and a trend towards poorer patient outcome. Our findings link clonal diversity with leukaemia-initiating-cell function and underscore the importance of developing therapies that eradicate all intratumoral subclones.
Genetic analysis of approach preferences for blue and red colors in 1-day-old, experientially naive quail, at 12th through 14th generations of bidirectional genetic selection, implicate four to eight segregating units of inheritance. Because the quails' initial approach choices are also readily modifiable by experience, these results point the way to studying the mediation of gene effects, environment effects, and gene-environment interactions in visually guided behaviors.
A mutant of Escherichia coli has been isolated in which potassium transport and methionine biosynthesis are both impaired. Studies on the nutritional requirements of this organism suggest that the cystathionine cleavage enzyme is impaired. Experiments in low-potassium medium showed that the mutant was unable to maintain the usual high cell potassium concentration. Studies that were made of the mutant and its revertants suggested that a single genetic event was responsible.
A recent newspaper account of the 1970 annual meeting of the AAAS was headlined, "Science's Blank Check Bounces." I am not, however, advocating that giving a "blank check" to science will solve all our problems. The discussion of science policy in the last three decades has too often confused necessary with sufficient conditions. A strong basic science is a necessary condition for a strong economy, a livable environment, and a tolerable society. But it is by no means a sufficient condition. That a vital science is an indispensable tool of human welfare in the present stage of evolution of man on the planet does not mean that it is the only tool or that it cannot also produce the opposite. Indeed, there seems almost to be a complementarity between the power for good and the power for evil inherent in science. Nuclear energy poses the possibility of nuclear holocaust, but is indispensable to a continuing supply of energy after fossil fuels run out. The computer threatens us with "big brother," but seems indispensable to the rational management of our complex social structures. Molecular genetics could be used for frightful purposes, but opens up the prospect of the final conquest of human disease and food supply. Drugs which control human behavior have opened up frightful possibilities for abuse and self-destruction, but they also offer the hope of conquest of mental illness. What I have referred to are really technologies, not science, but science is needed to use them wisely, although it will not guarantee their wise use. Although science cannot ask for a blank check, there is a part of it which must have the autonomy to "do its own thing"if it is to continue to serve society. How much of science should have this autonomy, and what sort of accountability should be required of it will be matters of continuing debate. Some accountability outside the scientific system itself is essential, as in any other human activity, but the degree of external accountability which is necessary will depend also on the success with which science maintains its own system of internal accountability, guaranteeing the intellectual excellence and integrity of its results. Although I do not believe scientists can be held accountable for the uses which society makes of the knowledge they produce, they do have an obligation to make clear the implications of this knowledge insofar as it is within their special intellectual competence to do so. However, I believe that the highest allegiance of science must continue to be to truth as defined by the validation procedures of the scientific process itself, and that the distortion of scientific results or the selective use of evidence for political purposes, no matter how worthy, is unforgivable insofar as it is presented cloaked by the authority and imputed objectivity of science. That science should have a measure of autonomy does not mean it cannot also respond to new social priorities. As in the past, new social missions can open up exciting new scientific questions, as fundamental as any generated by the internal workings of science. However, what is important is that no matter how much the broad strategy of science might be influenced by social priorities, the tactics should be largely governed by scientific criteria. Furthermore, it is essential that some science be supported and cultivated for its own sake alone. Here the primary criterion must be excellence as judged scientifically, that is, by internal standards. The fraction of the total technical effort that is supported in this way should have some degree of constancy over the long term. You are no doubt wondering what is the answer to the question posed by the title of this article. I cannot give a definite answer one way or the other. The threats to the integrity of science, both from within and from without, are probably greater than at any time in the past, because science is much more a part of the total social and political process, no longer the semihobby of a few dedicated and somewhat eccentric individuals. But I am an optimist. I do not think that the scientific enterprise is going down the drain. It will change, as science has always changed. It will respond to new social priorities, but, like an organism responding to disease, it will develop antibodies which will fight and finally contain excessive control by external criteria, and in fact will transform these external pressures into new opportunities and new fundamental fields of inquiry. But I could be wrong!
Several sporadic and genetic diseases are caused by protein misfolding. These include cystic fibrosis and other devastating diseases of childhood as well as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other debilitating maladies of the elderly. A unified view of the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of these conditions has led to the search for chemical chaperones that can slow, arrest or revert disease progression. Molecules are now emerging that link our biophysical insights with our therapeutic aspirations.
Immunoglobulin-binding factors are known to regulate the synthesis of B-cell-derived immunoglobulin heavy-chain isotypes. Cloning and nucleotide sequence determination of complementary DNA encoding rodent IgE-binding factors (IgE-BF) revealed that messenger RNA encodes a glycoprotein of 557 amino acids which is expressed as a precursor of relative molecular mass (Mr) 60,000 (60K) in COS7 monkey cells. We report here that the 3' two-thirds of the IgE-BF coding sequence shows a surprising homology (72%) at the DNA level with coding sequences of the gag and pol (DNA endonuclease) genes of the Syrian hamster intracisternal A particle (IAP H18), an endogenous retrovirus. This marked homology demonstrates that the rodent gene encoding IgE-BF is a hybrid gene which evolved very recently by integrating genes of viral origin, and that the encoded polypeptide comprises three separate domains: an IgE-BF domain and retrovirus-derived gag and DNA endonuclease-like domains. This may represent the first report of a cellular gene containing a virus-derived coding sequence.
Species of Rafflesiaceae possess the world's largest flowers (up to 1 meter in diameter), yet their precise evolutionary relationships have been elusive, hindering our understanding of the evolution of their extraordinary reproductive morphology. We present results of phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial, nuclear, and plastid data showing that Rafflesiaceae are derived from within Euphorbiaceae, the spurge family. Most euphorbs produce minute flowers, suggesting that the enormous flowers of Rafflesiaceae evolved from ancestors with tiny flowers. Given the inferred phylogeny, we estimate that there was a circa 79-fold increase in flower diameter on the stem lineage of Rafflesiaceae, making this one of the most dramatic cases of size evolution reported for eukaryotes.
Daily (12-hour) urine collections taken throughout the menstrual cycle were obtained from 30 young women who by genetic analysis were at risk for familial breast cancer, and from 30 control women carefully matched for age, height, and reproductive history. Steroids in the urine were extracted by glucuronidase hydrolysis, and the primary glucocorticoid, androgen, and estrogen hormones and their metabolites were measured by radioimmunoassay. Highly significant differences were observed only in the case of estrone and estradiol, with the high-risk subjects exhibiting lower values that the controls. This endocrine abnormality in young women at risk for breast cancer may be a potential discriminant for identifying women at risk for the disease in the population at large.
The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans switches heritably and at high frequency between at least seven general phenotypes identified by colony morphology on agar. Spontaneous conversion from the original smooth to variant phenotypes (star, ring, irregular wrinkle, hat, stipple, and fuzzy) occurs at a combined frequency of 1.4 X 10(-4), but is increased 200 times by a low dose of ultraviolet light that kills less than 10 percent of the cells. After the initial conversion, cells switch spontaneously to other phenotypes at a combined frequency of 2 X 10(-2). Switching is therefore heritable, but also reversible at high frequency. The genetic basis of this newly discovered process and its possible role in Candida pathogenesis are considered.
The age of the molecular organization of life as expressed in the genetic code can be estimated from experimental data. Comparative sequence analysis of transfer RNA by the method of statistical geometry in sequence space suggests that about one-third of the present transfer RNA sequence divergence was present at the urkingdom level about the time when archaebacteria separated from eubacteria. It is concluded that the genetic code is not older than, but almost as old as our planet. While this result may not be unexpected, it was not clear until now that interpretable data exist that permit inferences about such early stages of life as the establishment of the genetic code.
Recent analyses of the three-dimensional structure of synthetic DNA molecules has revealed the existence of a left-handed double-helical conformation of DNA, called Z-DNA. The Z-DNA structure was first observed in molecules having alternating guanine and cytosine bases, but has now also been shown for molecules of sequence poly(dT-dG) . poly(dC-dA) (refs 4-7). If Z-DNA occurs naturally then it might have quite different reactivities with molecules such as proteins or carcinogens from right-handed B-DNA. The interconversion of sequences between B and Z forms, under the influence, for example, of DNA binding proteins or chemical modification, may be important in regulating DNA function. So far, little data have been published on the occurrence of potential Z-DNA forming sequences in eukaryotic DNA. Here we report the presence of a sequence of 50 alternating dT and dG residues within one of the introns of a human cardiac muscle actin gene. Also, using a probe specific for poly(dT-dG) sequences, we have also found that potential Z-DNA forming sequences are highly repeated in the human genome.
We present data from an induced gallium arsenide (GaAs) quantum wire that exhibits an additional conductance plateau at 0.5(2e2/h), where e is the charge of an electron and h is Planck's constant, in zero magnetic field. The plateau was most pronounced when the potential landscape was tuned to be symmetric by using low-temperature scanning-probe techniques. Source-drain energy spectroscopy and temperature response support the hypothesis that the origin of the plateau is the spontaneous spin-polarization of the transport electrons: a ferromagnetic phase. Such devices may have applications in the field of spintronics to either generate or detect a spin-polarized current without the complications associated with external magnetic fields or magnetic materials.
Polycystic kidney diseases (PKD) are the most common hereditary diseases of the human kidney and account for ten per cent of patients requiring renal transplantation or dialysis. Renal cyst formation has been attributed to enhanced cell proliferation, unbalanced cell death, abnormal targeting of membrane proteins, aberrant kidney development and tubular obstruction, but there is no treatment that blocks the formation and enlargement of renal cysts. We have now developed an in vitro model of spontaneous cyst formation that distinguishes polycystic kidney epithelium from its normal counterpart. Inhibitors of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis did not prevent in vitro cyst formation, but this was reversibly inhibited by ouabain, amiloride and the microtubule-specific agents colchicine, vinblastine and taxol. The cpk mouse is a well-characterized recessive PKD model and we find that cpk/cpk mice develop PKD and die from uraemia by 4-5 weeks of age, but when treated weekly with taxol they survive for more than 200 days with minimal loss of renal function, show limited collecting-dust cyst enlargement, and attain adult size. Our results indicate that the microtubule cytoskeleton has a central role in the pathogenesis of PKD in cpk mice and that taxol may also be useful in treating human PKD.
Amino acid composition of proteins varies substantially between taxa and, thus, can evolve. For example, proteins from organisms with (G + C)-rich (or (A + T)-rich) genomes contain more (or fewer) amino acids encoded by (G + C)-rich codons. However, no universal trends in ongoing changes of amino acid frequencies have been reported. We compared sets of orthologous proteins encoded by triplets of closely related genomes from 15 taxa representing all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota), and used phylogenies to polarize amino acid substitutions. Cys, Met, His, Ser and Phe accrue in at least 14 taxa, whereas Pro, Ala, Glu and Gly are consistently lost. The same nine amino acids are currently accrued or lost in human proteins, as shown by analysis of non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms. All amino acids with declining frequencies are thought to be among the first incorporated into the genetic code; conversely, all amino acids with increasing frequencies, except Ser, were probably recruited late. Thus, expansion of initially under-represented amino acids, which began over 3,400 million years ago, apparently continues to this day.
Phenylalanine 87 of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c (Phe 82 in horse heart and bonito) is phylogenetically conserved and occurs near the surface of the protein. It has been suggested that this residue is directly involved in electron transfer between cytochrome c and cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) and may also control the polarity of the haem environment. Because Phe residues are not susceptible to chemical modification, no direct means of studying the functional role of Phe 87 has been available, so we have chosen Phe 87 as our initial target here to test the feasibility of using site-directed mutagenesis as a means of studying structure-function relationships in cytochrome c. We have changed the codon for Phe 87 to that of either a Ser, a Tyr or a Gly. The mutated genes have been introduced into a yeast strain lacking both isozymes of cytochrome c. Unlike the recipient strain, transformants grow on a non-fermentable carbon source, indicating that the mutant proteins can reduce cytochrome oxidase. The purified mutant proteins are similar to wild type with respect to their visible spectra, 20-70% as active as wild-type protein in the CCP assay, and their reduction potentials are lowered by as much as 50 mV. Thus Phe 87 is not essential for cytochrome c to transfer electrons but is involved in determining the reduction potential.
The mosaic-structured Vibrio cholerae genome points to the importance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the evolution of this human pathogen. We showed that V. cholerae can acquire new genetic material by natural transformation during growth on chitin, a biopolymer that is abundant in aquatic habitats (e.g., from crustacean exoskeletons), where it lives as an autochthonous microbe. Transformation competence was found to require a type IV pilus assembly complex, a putative DNA binding protein, and three convergent regulatory cascades, which are activated by chitin, increasing cell density, and nutrient limitation, a decline in growth rate, or stress.
Many mutations at complex genetic loci in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster are associated with insertions of transposable elements. At the Notch locus, members of one class of insertion-associated mutations, termed glossy-like, produce a recessive viable, smooth-eye phenotype with mottled pigmentation. Members of a second class, facet, produce a recessive viable, rough-eye phenotype with homogeneous pigmentation. Both classes of mutations fail to complement Notch lethal mutations, so they behave as Notch alleles. Here we report that each glossy-like mutation is associated with an insertion of the same transposable element (flea). Each flea insertion occurs in the same orientation, but at different locations within intervening sequences of the Notch locus. In contrast, each facet mutation is associated with insertion of a unique, non-flea, transposable element. Insertions producing a facet phenotype and insertions causing a glossy-like phenotype can break Notch intervening sequences at precisely the same location. This suggests that the type of insertion element rather than its position within an affected gene is the primary determinant of the phenotype observed.
Inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C is the enzyme that generates phosphoinositide-derived messenger molecules. Mammalian cells contain at least five immunologically distinct phospholipase C enzymes that appear to be separate gene products. Complete amino acid sequences of four of these isozymes have been established. The overall sequence similarity is surprisingly low for enzymes catalyzing the same chemical reaction: three of them show limited amino acid sequence similarity to each other in two narrow regions, and the fourth enzyme is completely different. The diversity in primary structure together with different regional and cellular expression of the isozymes suggests that each isozyme has a defined function in processing the physiological response of different cell types to a variety of external stimuli and that each is regulated differently.
The discovery of RNA enzymes has, for the first time, provided a single molecule that has both genetic and catalytic properties. We have devised techniques for the mutation, selection and amplification of catalytic RNA, all of which can be performed rapidly in vitro. Here we describe how these techniques can be integrated and performed repeatedly within a single reaction vessel. This allows evolution experiments to be carried out in response to artificially imposed selection constraints. We worked with the Tetrahymena ribozyme, a self-splicing group I intron derived from the large ribosomal RNA precursor of Tetrahymena thermophila that catalyses sequence-specific phosphoester transfer reactions involving RNA substrates. It consists of 413 nucleotides, and assumes a well-defined secondary and tertiary structure responsible for its catalytic activity. We selected for variant forms of the enzyme that could best react with a DNA substrate. This led to the recovery of a mutant form of the enzyme that cleaves DNA more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme. The selected molecule represents the discovery of the first RNA enzyme known to cleave single-stranded DNA specifically.
Determining the composition and physical properties of shallow-dipping, active normal faults (dips < 35 degrees with respect to the horizontal) is important for understanding how such faults slip under low resolved shear stress and accommodate significant extension of the crust and lithosphere. Seismic reflection images and earthquake source parameters show that a magnitude 6.2 earthquake occurred at about 5 km depth on or close to a normal fault with a dip of 25-30 degrees located ahead of a propagating spreading centre in the Woodlark basin. Here we present results from a genetic algorithm inversion of seismic reflection data, which shows that the fault at 4-5 km depth contains a 33-m-thick layer with seismic velocities of about 4.3 km s(-1), which we interpret to be composed of serpentinite fault gouge. Isolated zones exhibit velocities as low as approximately 1.7 km s(-1) with high porosities, which we suggest are maintained by high fluid pressures. We propose that hydrothermal fluid flow, possibly driven by a deep magmatic heat source, and high extensional stresses ahead of the ridge tip have created conditions for fault weakness and strain localization on the low-angle normal fault.
Arabidopsis thaliana is not just for plant biologists anymore. A few intrepid ecologists and evolutionary biologists are now touting its merits as a system in which to study the genetic basis of the traits they study. The newly completed genome sequence is allowing researchers to connect the genotype--an organism's particular mix of genes--with its phenotype--how that organism develops and acts--in ways that have not been possible in other organisms whose genetics are not as well known.
In mammals, an example of planar cell polarity (PCP) is the uniform orientation of the hair cell stereociliary bundles within the cochlea. The PCP pathway of Drosophila refers to a conserved signalling pathway that regulates the coordinated orientation of cells or structures within the plane of an epithelium. Here we show that a mutation in Vangl2, a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila PCP gene Strabismus/Van Gogh, results in significant disruptions in the polarization of stereociliary bundles in mouse cochlea as a result of defects in the direction of movement and/or anchoring of the kinocilium within each hair cell. Similar, but less severe, defects are observed in animals containing a mutation in the LAP protein family gene Scrb1 (homologous with Drosophila scribble). Polarization defects in animals heterozygous for Vangl2 and Scrb1 are comparable with Vangl2 homozygotes, demonstrating genetic interactions between these genes in the regulation of PCP in mammals. These results demonstrate a role for the PCP pathway in planar polarization in mammals, and identify Scrb1 as a PCP gene.
The frequency of the Hp(1) gene in Polish subjects is 0.36. This frequency is lower than that in Western European populations and higher than that in Asiatic populations. We suggest that the increase in frequency of this gene from East to West has a regular continuous character that may be attributed to a stillunclear genetic mechanism.
A key gene involved in plant senescence, mutations of which partially disable chlorophyll catabolism and confer stay-green leaf and cotyledon phenotypes, has been identified in Pisum sativum, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Festuca pratensis by using classical and molecular genetics and comparative genomics. A stay-green locus in F. pratensis is syntenically equivalent to a similar stay-green locus on rice chromosome 9. Functional testing in Arabidopsis of a homolog of the rice candidate gene revealed (i) senescence-associated gene expression and (ii) a stay-green phenotype after RNA interference silencing. Genetic mapping in pea demonstrated cosegregation with the yellow/green cotyledon polymorphism (I/i) first reported by Gregor Mendel in 1866.
Cancer stem cells, which share many common properties and regulatory machineries with normal stem cells, have recently been proposed to be responsible for tumorigenesis and to contribute to cancer resistance. The main challenges in cancer biology are to identify cancer stem cells and to define the molecular events required for transforming normal cells to cancer stem cells. Here we show that Pten deletion in mouse haematopoietic stem cells leads to a myeloproliferative disorder, followed by acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Self-renewable leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) are enriched in the c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) compartment, where unphosphorylated beta-catenin is significantly increased. Conditional ablation of one allele of the beta-catenin gene substantially decreases the incidence and delays the occurrence of T-ALL caused by Pten loss, indicating that activation of the beta-catenin pathway may contribute to the formation or expansion of the LSC population. Moreover, a recurring chromosomal translocation, T(14;15), results in aberrant overexpression of the c-myc oncogene in c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) LSCs and CD3(+) leukaemic blasts, recapitulating a subset of human T-ALL. No alterations in Notch1 signalling are detected in this model, suggesting that Pten inactivation and c-myc overexpression may substitute functionally for Notch1 abnormalities, leading to T-ALL development. Our study indicates that multiple genetic or molecular alterations contribute cooperatively to LSC transformation.
Viruses exist wherever life is found. They are a major cause of mortality, a driver of global geochemical cycles and a reservoir of the greatest genetic diversity on Earth. In the oceans, viruses probably infect all living things, from bacteria to whales. They affect the form of available nutrients and the termination of algal blooms. Viruses can move between marine and terrestrial reservoirs, raising the spectre of emerging pathogens. Our understanding of the effect of viruses on global systems and processes continues to unfold, overthrowing the idea that viruses and virus-mediated processes are sidebars to global processes.
The Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) and H19 genes are imprinted, resulting in silencing of the maternal and paternal alleles, respectively. This event is dependent upon an imprinted-control region two kilobases upstream of H19 (refs 1, 2). On the paternal chromosome this element is methylated and required for the silencing of H19 (refs 2-4). On the maternal chromosome the region is unmethylated and required for silencing of the Igf2 gene 90 kilobases upstream. We have proposed that the unmethylated imprinted-control region acts as a chromatin boundary that blocks the interaction of Igf2 with enhancers that lie 3' of H19 (refs 5, 6). This enhancer-blocking activity would then be lost when the region was methylated, thereby allowing expression of Igf2 paternally. Here we show, using transgenic mice and tissue culture, that the unmethylated imprinted-control regions from mouse and human H19 exhibit enhancer-blocking activity. Furthermore, we show that CTCF, a zinc finger protein implicated in vertebrate boundary function, binds to several sites in the unmethylated imprinted-control region that are essential for enhancer blocking. Consistent with our model, CTCF binding is abolished by DNA methylation. This is the first example, to our knowledge, of a regulated chromatin boundary in vertebrates.
The LMO2 oncogene causes a subset of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), including four cases that arose as adverse events in gene therapy trials. To investigate the cellular origin of LMO2-induced leukemia, we used cell fate mapping to study mice in which the Lmo2 gene was constitutively expressed in the thymus. Lmo2 induced self-renewal of committed T cells in the mice more than 8 months before the development of overt T-ALL. These self-renewing cells retained the capacity for T cell differentiation but expressed several genes typical of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting that Lmo2 might reactivate an HSC-specific transcriptional program. Forced expression of one such gene, Hhex, was sufficient to initiate self-renewal of thymocytes in vivo. Thus, Lmo2 promotes the self-renewal of preleukemic thymocytes, providing a mechanism by which committed T cells can then accumulate additional genetic mutations required for leukemic transformation.
RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful new tool with which to perform loss-of-function genetic screens in lower organisms and can greatly facilitate the identification of components of cellular signalling pathways. In mammalian cells, such screens have been hampered by a lack of suitable tools that can be used on a large scale. We and others have recently developed expression vectors to direct the synthesis of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that act as short interfering RNA (siRNA)-like molecules to stably suppress gene expression. Here we report the construction of a set of retroviral vectors encoding 23,742 distinct shRNAs, which target 7,914 different human genes for suppression. We use this RNAi library in human cells to identify one known and five new modulators of p53-dependent proliferation arrest. Suppression of these genes confers resistance to both p53-dependent and p19ARF-dependent proliferation arrest, and abolishes a DNA-damage-induced G1 cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, we describe siRNA bar-code screens to rapidly identify individual siRNA vectors associated with a specific phenotype. These new tools will greatly facilitate large-scale loss-of-function genetic screens in mammalian cells.
Designing efficient policies to slow global warming requires an approach that combines economic tools with relations from the natural sciences. The dynamic integrated climate-economy (DICE) model presented here, an intertemporal general-equilibrium model of economic growth and climate change, can be used to investigate alternative approaches to slowing climate change. Evaluation of five policies suggests that a modest carbon tax would be an efficient approach to slow global warming, whereas rigid emissions- or climate-stabilization approaches would impose significant net economic costs.
The yeast nuclear protein Yra1p is an essential export factor for mRNA. Yra1p interacts directly with the mRNA transport factor Mex67p/Mtr2p, which is associated with the nuclear pore. Here, we report a genetic interaction between YRA1 and SUB2, the gene for a DEAD box helicase involved in splicing. Mutation of SUB2 as well as its overexpression leads to a defect in mRNA export. Moreover, Yra1p and Sub2p bind directly to each other both in vivo and in vitro. Significantly, Sub2p and Mex67p/Mtr2p bind to the same domains of Yra1p, and the proteins compete for binding to Yra1p. Together, these data indicate that the spliceosomal component Sub2p is also important in mRNA export and may function to recruit Yra1p to the mRNA. Sub2p may then be displaced from Yra1p by the binding of Mex67p/Mtr2p, which participates in the export of mRNA through the nuclear pores.
Two general mechanisms of sex determination have been identified among gonochoristic vertebrates: environmental sex determination where offspring become male or female in response to an environmental factor(s) during development (for example, some fishes and reptiles); and genetic sex determination where sex is determined by genotype at conception (as in birds and mammals). How do these sex-determining systems evolve? Direct evidence is virtually non-existent because the sex-determining systems of most species appear to have little genetic variation. Here we provide the first evidence of adaptive variation in environmental and genetic sex determination within a species. We show that in a fish with temperature-dependent sex determination, populations at different latitudes compensate for differences in thermal environment and seasonality by adjusting the response of sex ratio to temperature, and by altering the level of environmental as opposed to genetic control. The adjustments observed are precisely those predicted by adaptive sex ratio theory.
The flash of Noctiluca miliaris occurs only in response to a characteristic all-or-none action potential, the polarity of which is opposite to that of metazoan action potentials, whether recorded internally or externally. Mechanical stimulation evokes a slow, generator-like graded potential which can give rise to the flash-triggering action potential. The flash is all-or-none; it facilitates, summates, and exhibits fatigue, each independently of changes in the amplitude of the action potential.
During meiosis, accurate separation of maternal and paternal chromosomes requires that they first be connected to one another through homologous recombination. Meiotic recombination has many intriguing but poorly understood features that distinguish it from recombination in mitotically dividing cells, and several of these features depend on the meiosis-specific DNA strand exchange protein Dmc1 (disrupted meiotic cDNA1). Many questions about this protein have arisen since its discovery more than a decade ago, but recent genetic and biochemical breakthroughs promise to shed light on the unique behaviours and functions of this central player in the remarkable chromosome dynamics of meiosis.
Analysis of isozyme variability demonstrates that bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) has a diploid genetic system and expresses solely disomic inheritance patterns. Electrophoretic data indicate that genetically variable progeny are produced in natural populations after intergametophytic mating rather than by a process involving recombination between duplicated unlinked loci. Although some enzymes are encoded by more than one locus, this has resulted from subcellular compartmentalization of isozymes, and there is no evidence of extensive gene duplication resulting from polyploidy. The conclusions reached in this report differ from those which propose polyploidy as an adaptive mechanism for maintaining genetic variability in Pteridium and other homosporous pteridophytes.
A fundamental tenet of classical mendelian genetics is that allelic information is stably inherited from one generation to the next, resulting in predictable segregation patterns of differing alleles. Although several exceptions to this principle are known, all represent specialized cases that are mechanistically restricted to either a limited set of specific genes (for example mating type conversion in yeast) or specific types of alleles (for example alleles containing transposons or repeated sequences). Here we show that Arabidopsis plants homozygous for recessive mutant alleles of the organ fusion gene HOTHEAD (HTH) can inherit allele-specific DNA sequence information that was not present in the chromosomal genome of their parents but was present in previous generations. This previously undescribed process is shown to occur at all DNA sequence polymorphisms examined and therefore seems to be a general mechanism for extra-genomic inheritance of DNA sequence information. We postulate that these genetic restoration events are the result of a template-directed process that makes use of an ancestral RNA-sequence cache.
The Afrotropical mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, a major vector of malaria, is currently undergoing speciation into the M and S molecular forms. These forms have diverged in larval ecology and reproductive behavior through unknown genetic mechanisms, despite considerable levels of hybridization. Previous genome-wide scans using gene-based microarrays uncovered divergence between M and S that was largely confined to gene-poor pericentromeric regions, prompting a speciation-with-ongoing-gene-flow model that implicated only about 3% of the genome near centromeres in the speciation process. Here, based on the complete M and S genome sequences, we report widespread and heterogeneous genomic divergence inconsistent with appreciable levels of interform gene flow, suggesting a more advanced speciation process and greater challenges to identify genes critical to initiating that process.
Monoclonal antibodies can now be genetically engineered and endowed with new properties. In the future, gene technology could enable antigen-binding fragments to be made by exploiting repertoires of variable domain genes derived from immunized animals and expressed in bacteria. How readily can this approach be extended to production of 'in vitro' repertoires of variable domain genes, and obviate the immunization of animals?
The F-actin filament has been constructed from the atomic structure of the actin monomer to fit the observed X-ray fibre diagram from oriented gels of F-actin. A unique orientation of the monomer with respect to the actin helix has been found. The main interactions are along the two-start helix with a contribution from a loop extending across the filament axis provided by the molecule in the adjacent strand. There are also contacts along the left-handed genetic helix.
A unified genetic, physical, and functional map of the human X chromosome is being built through a concerted, international effort. About 40 percent of the 160 million base pairs of the X chromosome DNA have been cloned in overlapping, ordered contigs derived from yeast artificial chromosomes. This rapid progress toward a physical map is accelerating the identification of inherited disease genes, 26 of which are already cloned and more than 50 others regionally localized by linkage analysis. This article summarizes the mapping strategies now used and the impact of genome research on the understanding of X chromosome inactivation and X-linked diseases.
Genetic maps, which document the way in which recombination rates vary over a genome, are an essential tool for many genetic analyses. We present a high-resolution genetic map of the human genome, based on statistical analyses of genetic variation data, and identify more than 25,000 recombination hotspots, together with motifs and sequence contexts that play a role in hotspot activity. Differences between the behavior of recombination rates over large (megabase) and small (kilobase) scales lead us to suggest a two-stage model for recombination in which hotspots are stochastic features, within a framework in which large-scale rates are constrained.
A large body of diverse comparative data now exists for a major phylogenetic synthesis of the higher-level relationships among eutherian (placental) mammals. We present such a phylogenetic synthesis using the composite trees or supertrees from the combined and separate analyses of their published molecular and morphological source phylogenies. Our combined and separate supertrees largely support the same suprafamilial taxa and orders, but different interordinal clades. These similarities and differences reinforce the continuing contributions of morphological studies, while highlighting the growing influence of molecular information on the field. As current summaries of past research, our supertrees emphasize opportunities for future work, while providing a step toward the eventual integration of the data and characters themselves.
Neutral atomic Bose condensates and degenerate Fermi gases have been used to realize important many-body phenomena in their most simple and essential forms, without many of the complexities usually associated with material systems. However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation-a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron systems. The limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a magnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum rotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the difficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches are not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics. Here we experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms, which is evident from the appearance of vortices in our Bose-Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry's phase sufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the limitations of rotating systems. With a suitable lattice configuration, it should be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling studies of topological quantum computation.
The cytoplasmic proteins beta-catenin of vertebrates and armadillo of Drosophila have two functions: they link the cadherin cell-adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton, and they participate in the wnt/wingless signal pathway. Here we show, in a yeast two-hybrid screen, that the architectural transcription factor LEF-1 (for lymphoid enhancer-binding factor) interacts with beta-catenin. In mammalian cells, coexpressed LEF-1 and beta-catenin form a complex that is localized to the nucleus and can be detected by immunoprecipitation. Moreover, LEF-1 and beta-catenin form a ternary complex with DNA that splays an altered DNA bend. Microinjection of LEF-1 into XenoPus embryos induces axis duplication, which is augmented by interaction with beta-catenin. Thus beta-catenin regulates gene expression by direct interaction with transcription factors such as LEF-1, providing a molecular mechanism for the transmission of signals, from cell-adhesion components or wnt protein to the nucleus.
A physical map has been constructed of the human genome containing 15,086 sequence-tagged sites (STSs), with an average spacing of 199 kilobases. The project involved assembly of a radiation hybrid map of the human genome containing 6193 loci and incorporated a genetic linkage map of the human genome containing 5264 loci. This information was combined with the results of STS-content screening of 10,850 loci against a yeast artificial chromosome library to produce an integrated map, anchored by the radiation hybrid and genetic maps. The map provides radiation hybrid coverage of 99 percent and physical coverage of 94 percent of the human genome. The map also represents an early step in an international project to generate a transcript map of the human genome, with more than 3235 expressed sequences localized. The STSs in the map provide a scaffold for initiating large-scale sequencing of the human genome.
Roughly 60% of the Earth's outer surface is composed of oceanic crust formed by volcanic processes at mid-ocean ridges. Although only a small fraction of this vast volcanic terrain has been visually surveyed or sampled, the available evidence suggests that explosive eruptions are rare on mid-ocean ridges, particularly at depths below the critical point for seawater (3,000 m). A pyroclastic deposit has never been observed on the sea floor below 3,000 m, presumably because the volatile content of mid-ocean-ridge basalts is generally too low to produce the gas fractions required for fragmenting a magma at such high hydrostatic pressure. We employed new deep submergence technologies during an International Polar Year expedition to the Gakkel ridge in the Arctic Basin at 85 degrees E, to acquire photographic and video images of 'zero-age' volcanic terrain on this remote, ice-covered ridge. Here we present images revealing that the axial valley at 4,000 m water depth is blanketed with unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits, including bubble wall fragments (limu o Pele), covering a large (>10 km(2)) area. At least 13.5 wt% CO(2) is necessary to fragment magma at these depths, which is about tenfold the highest values previously measured in a mid-ocean-ridge basalt. These observations raise important questions about the accumulation and discharge of magmatic volatiles at ultraslow spreading rates on the Gakkel ridge and demonstrate that large-scale pyroclastic activity is possible along even the deepest portions of the global mid-ocean ridge volcanic system.
The insertion sequence (IS) elements, IS1 and IS2, present in multiple copies in the Escherichia coli chromosome, are transposable genetic elements of known nucleotide sequence. These elements can modulate gene expression, but it is not known whether they normally function in genetic control. To determine whether IS elements could exert control through specific RNA transcripts, we hybridised lambda NNC1857 r14 (carrying IS1) and pBR322 (carrying a portion of IS2) to Northern blots of E. coli RNA. Regions of homology between the IS elements and ribosomal RNA were observed. Computer analysis of reported nucleotide sequences detected large segments of homology between the IS elements and both 23S and 16S rRNA. Additional homologous sequences in phi X174 and a leader region of a ribosomal protein gene cluster were also detected. The homologous sequence between IS2 and 16S rTNA is the same sequence in phi X174 DNA which codes for the ends of the E and D gene and the start of J. The partial IS sequences may represent silent evolutionary remnants or they could modulate the expression of genes carrying these sequences.
Nineteen of 20 healthy Oriental adults living in the United States developed abdominal cramps and diarrhea after ingesting an amount of lactose equivalent to that in one quart of milk; 14 reported similar symptoms after one or two glasses of milk; all had consumed milk as infants without having such symptoms. Two of 20 Caucasians tested were intolerant to milk and lactose. Many Orientals therefore may have a genetically determined lactase deficiency that may lead to intolerance to milk. Since lactase deficiency is also common among Negroes, the bulk of the world's adult population is probably intolerant to milk.
Mutational pathways rely on introducing changes in the DNA double helix. This may be achieved by the incorporation of a noncomplementary base on replication or during genetic recombination, leading to substitution mutation. In vivo studies have shown that most combinations of base-pair mismatches can be accommodated in the DNA double helix, albeit with varying efficiencies. Fidelity of replication requires the recognition and excision of mismatched bases by proofreading enzymes and post-replicative mismatch repair systems. Rates of excision vary with the type of mismatch and there is some evidence that these are influenced by the nature of the neighbouring sequences. However, there is little experimental information about the molecular structure of mismatches and their effect on the DNA double helix. We have recently determined the crystal structures of several DNA fragments with guanine X thymine and adenine X guanine mismatches in a full turn of a B-DNA helix and now report the nature of the base pairing between adenine and cytosine in an isomorphous fragment. The base pair found in the present study is novel and we believe has not previously been demonstrated. Our results suggest that the enzymatic recognition of mismatches is likely to occur at the level of the base pairs and that the efficiency of repair can be correlated with structural features.
The regulation of members of the knotted1-like homeobox (knox) gene family is required for the normal initiation and development of lateral organs. The maize rough sheath2 (rs2) gene, which encodes a Myb-domain protein, is expressed in lateral organ primordia and their initials. Mutations in the rs2 gene permit ectopic expression of knox genes in leaf and floral primordia, causing a variety of developmental defects. Ectopic KNOX protein accumulation in rs2 mutants occurs in a subset of the normal rs2-expressing cells. This variegated accumulation of KNOX proteins in rs2 mutants suggests that rs2 represses knox expression through epigenetic means.
Empty capsids of polyoma virus interact with DNA in a cell-free system to form polyoma-like particles (PLP). The DNA in these particles is protected from the action of pancreatic deoxyribonuclease. Transfer of genetic information by PLP has been accomplished by using a restriction fragment containing the transforming sequences of polyoma DNA as a model gene. Infection of rat F111 cells by PLP containing these sequences results in DNA-mediated cellular transformation. Gene transfer by PLP is 50 to 150 times more efficient than by the calcium phosphate precipitation method.
One defining goal of synthetic biology is the development of engineering-based approaches that enable the construction of gene-regulatory networks according to 'design specifications' generated from computational modelling. This approach provides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches and oscillators, and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development and cellular population control. Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops. Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single-cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited large-amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain confirming this computational prediction.
Genomics profoundly influences current biology. One of many exciting consequences of this revolution is the potential for identifying and studying the genetic basis of those traits affecting fitness that are key to natural selection. Recent studies using a multitude of genomic approaches have established such genotype-phenotype relationships in natural populations, giving new insight into the genetic architecture of quantitative variation. In parallel, an emerging understanding of the quantitative genetics of fitness variation in the wild means that we are poised to see a synthesis of ecological and molecular approaches in evolutionary biology.
Natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity (NCMC) capable of in vitro lysis of various lymphoid and non-lymphoid tumours has been described in mice and other species, including man. NCMC has been proposed as a first level of defence against tumour growth in vivo, one which does not need the priming of the conventional immunological response. The effector cells of NCMC seem to belong to a special category of lymphoid cells, being neither classical T or B cells nor macrophages; natural killer (NK) cells have been proposed as the prototype effector cell, although some heterogeneity among effector cells seems to exist, depending on the target cells used for testing. Two main subgroups of NCMC effector cells have been defined: NK cells directed against lymphoma targets and natural cytotoxic (NC) cells directed against solid non-lymphoid tumours. We describe here another distinction between the two systems: while NK activity is low in mice homozygous for the beige (bg) gene NC activity in spleen cell preparations from these animals is comparable with that observed in the appropriate controls (bg/+ and +/+ littermates). The bg syndrome of mice affects lysosome, melanosome and enzymatic functions and is a homologue of the Chediak--Higashi syndrome of man. Defective NK activity in blood lymphocytes has also been reported in patients with Chediak--Higashi syndrome. We also show that several mouse strains which have low NK activity, have normal or high levels of NC functions, expanding our previous observation that NC and NK cells are under distinct genetic control.
The physiological state of the cell is controlled by signal transduction mechanisms which regulate the balance between protein kinase and protein phosphatase activities. Here we report that a single protein can, depending on which particular amino-acid residue is phosphorylated, function either as a kinase or phosphatase inhibitor. DARPP-32 (dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phospho-protein, relative molecular mass 32,000) is converted into an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) at threonine 34. We find that DARPP-32 is converted into an inhibitor of PKA when phosphorylated at threonine 75 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Cdk5 phosphorylates DARPP-32 in vitro and in intact brain cells. Phospho-Thr 75 DARPP-32 inhibits PKA in vitro by a competitive mechanism. Decreasing phospho-Thr 75 DARPP-32 in striatal slices, either by a Cdk5-specific inhibitor or by using genetically altered mice, results in increased dopamine-induced phosphorylation of PKA substrates and augmented peak voltage-gated calcium currents. Thus DARPP-32 is a bifunctional signal transduction molecule which, by distinct mechanisms, controls a serine/threonine kinase and a serine/threonine phosphatase.
A combination of genetics, biochemistry, and biophysics was used to show that calmodulin is involved in the regulation of an ion channel. Calmodulin restored the Ca2+-dependent K+ current in pantophobiac, a mutant in Paramecium that lacks this current. The restoration of the current occurred within 2 hours after the injection of 1 picogram of wild-type calmodulin into the mutant. The current remained for approximately 30 hours before the mutant phenotype returned. The injection of calmodulin isolated from pantophobiac had no effect. These results imply that calmodulin is required for the function or regulation of the Ca2+-dependent K+ current in Paramecium.
The visual labeling of various microorganisms has been accomplished with specific fluorescent ultraviolet-absorbing compounds that not only have been bound by the cell but have been transferred by it to subsequent growth. The possibility of application to genetic studies is suggested.
The role of behavioral mechanisms in animal invasions is poorly understood. We show that asymmetric mating interactions between closely related but previously allopatric genetic groups of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, a haplodiploid species, have been a driving force contributing to widespread invasion and displacement by alien populations. We conducted long-term field surveys, caged population experiments, and detailed behavioral observations in Zhejiang, China, and Queensland, Australia, to investigate the invasion process and its underlying behavioral mechanisms. During invasion and displacement, we found increased frequency of copulation leading to increased production of female progeny among the invader, as well as reduced copulation and female production in the indigenous genetic groups. Such asymmetric mating interactions may be critical to determining the capacity of a haplodiploid invader and the consequences for its closely related indigenous organisms.
Serums from 390 Norwegian blood donors and 31 members of two families were studied by starch gel electrophoresis. Five different prealbumin phenotypes were found, indicating a genetic theory of three codominant alleles for which the terms Pr(F), Pr(M), and Pr(S) are proposed.
The newly described T-cell receptor (TCR) delta locus is located inside the TCR alpha locus, between variable region (V)alpha and joining region (J)alpha. Although the delta and alpha TCR genes are physically linked on the same chromosome, they are sequentially expressed during T-cell development. This implies the existence of a highly efficient regulatory mechanism by which these two genes are independently rearranged. We have recently described a genetic element 'T early alpha' (TEA) in humans transcribed in foetal thymocytes, spliced alternatively to constant region (C)alpha, and located between the TCR-delta locus (5') and the group of J alpha segments (3'). Importantly, TEA flanks a common site of rearrangement in the thymus, and distinguishes cells using TCR-gamma/delta (TEA in germline configuration) from cells using TCR-alpha/beta (TEA deleted on both chromosomes). In order to understand this TEA-associated recombination we analysed genomic clones representing these thymic rearrangements. We show that the TEA-associated recombination deletes the delta locus before productive (V delta D delta J delta) rearrangement. The diversity (D)delta and J delta regions, which provide the major source of delta gene diversity, are eliminated as a consequence of delta gene deletion and cannot then be used in conjunction with an alpha-TCR. We propose that the TEA-associated deletion of TCR-delta precedes the formation of an alpha-TCR and could down-regulate TCR-delta formation in maturing thymus.
Communication between organelles is an important feature of all eukaryotic cells. To uncover components involved in mitochondria/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions, we screened for mutants that could be complemented by a synthetic protein designed to artificially tether the two organelles. We identified the Mmm1/Mdm10/Mdm12/Mdm34 complex as a molecular tether between ER and mitochondria. The tethering complex was composed of proteins resident of both ER and mitochondria. With the use of genome-wide mapping of genetic interactions, we showed that the components of the tethering complex were functionally connected to phospholipid biosynthesis and calcium-signaling genes. In mutant cells, phospholipid biosynthesis was impaired. The tethering complex localized to discrete foci, suggesting that discrete sites of close apposition between ER and mitochondria facilitate interorganelle calcium and phospholipid exchange.
The application of directed selection techniques and genetic engineering methods for manipulation of antibiotic-producing microorganisms is generating a new era in industrial microbiology. Modern methods, based on advances in the knowledge of the biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms involved in the induction and repression of genes involved in antibiotic synthesis, provide a means of increasing antibiotic activity. Hence, recombinant DNA and protoplast fusion methods are used to alter the genetics of antibiotic producers in a semirandom fashion for the development of novel hybrid antibiotics. Directed mutation and selection, protoplast fusion, and both semirandom and specific recombinant DNA methods are examples of alternative procedures for manipulating the biosynthetic pathways of microorganisms for strain improvement and for new hybrid antibiotic synthesis.
A mutation in the white gene of Drosophila mauritiana resulting from insertion of the transposable element mariner exhibits genetic instability in germline and somatic cells. The instability is greatly enhanced in the presence of the trans-acting autosomal factor Mos, giving eye-color mosaics with pigmented sectors of tissue on an otherwise peach-colored background. The Mos factor, when introduced into the genome of the sibling species Drosophila simulans, exhibited a dramatic maternal effect on expression of the mosaic phenotype. When D. simulans mosaic females (heterozygous for Mos) were crossed with non-mosaic males, two distinct classes of mosaic offspring occurred, one resulting from a maternal effect in which the non-Mos offspring were nevertheless mosaic. The maternal effect was mediated by a product acting after fertilization, and was expressed to varying extents in different backcross strains.
Simple discrete-time ecological models for a species with alternating reproduction and dispersal are shown to have complex transient dynamics. If the density dependence (nonlinearity) is strong enough, then the time required to reach the final dynamics is usually very long, approaching thousands of generations, and there are typically very sudden changes in the form of the dynamics. Apparent chaos can change to cycles or vice versa. These results are consistent with observed sudden changes in the form of the dynamics of a single species and imply that transient dynamics of ecological models may be more relevant than long-term behavior.
During malignant transformation, cancer cells acquire genetic mutations that override the normal mechanisms controlling cellular proliferation. Primary rodent cells are efficiently converted into tumorigenic cells by the coexpression of cooperating oncogenes. However, similar experiments with human cells have consistently failed to yield tumorigenic transformants, indicating a fundamental difference in the biology of human and rodent cells. The few reported successes in the creation of human tumour cells have depended on the use of chemical or physical agents to achieve immortalization, the selection of rare, spontaneously arising immortalized cells, or the use of an entire viral genome. We show here that the ectopic expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) in combination with two oncogenes (the simian virus 40 large-T oncoprotein and an oncogenic allele of H-ras) results in direct tumorigenic conversion of normal human epithelial and fibroblast cells. These results demonstrate that disruption of the intracellular pathways regulated by large-T, oncogenic ras and telomerase suffices to create a human tumor cell.
The cause of multiple sclerosis remains unknown after more than a century of study. Unconfirmed work has once more indicated that a viral infection may be important in the aetiology of the disease, and there is considerable evidence for an important genetic influence on disease susceptibility. The clinical course is as variable as that of any disease in medicine. Studies using serial magnetic resonance imaging have helped to define the disease course and response to experimental therapies. Although the predominant pathological characteristic is myelin loss with preservation of axons, some studies recall classic descriptions that irreversible axonal destruction may occur, perhaps even in the early stages of the illness. There are now several, partially effective therapies for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and here I review progress in determining the timing and course of the illness and the steps that need to be taken to identify more effective treatments for this disease.
Severe deafness or hearing impairment is the most prevalent inherited sensory disorder, affecting about 1 in 1,000 children. Most deafness results from peripheral auditory defects that occur as a consequence of either conductive (outer or middle ear) or sensorineuronal (cochlea) abnormalities. Although a number of mutant genes have been identified that are responsible for syndromic (multiple phenotypic disease) deafness such as Waardenburg syndrome and Usher 1B syndrome, little is known about the genetic basis of non-syndromic (single phenotypic disease) deafness. Here we study a pedigree containing cases of autosomal dominant deafness and have identified a mutation in the gene encoding the gap-junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26) that segregates with the profound deafness in the family. Cx26 mutations resulting in premature stop codons were also found in three autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineuronal deafness pedigrees, genetically linked to chromosome 13q11-12 (DFNB1), where the Cx26 gene is localized. Immunohistochemical staining of human cochlear cells for Cx26 demonstrated high levels of expression. To our knowledge, this is the first non-syndromic sensorineural autosomal deafness susceptibility gene to be identified, which implicates Cx26 as an important component of the human cochlea.
In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, division is controlled in response to nutrient limitation and in preparation for conjugation. Cells deprived of an essential nutrient or responding to mating pheromones cease division and become synchronous in the G1 interval, apparently constrained from completing a critical event. This event has been given the operational designation of 'start'. We have isolated a large number of start mutations which confer on S. cerevisiae cells a conditional inability to complete start (Fig. 1) presumably because they define genes which must be expressed for the start event to be successfully completed. We have described the isolation on plasmids of one of the start genes, CDC28, by genetic complementation and initial characterization of its product. We now describe the DNA sequence of the gene CDC28.
Saccharides have a central role in the nutrition of all living organisms. Whereas several saccharide uptake systems are shared between the different phylogenetic kingdoms, the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system exists almost exclusively in bacteria. This multi-component system includes an integral membrane protein EIIC that transports saccharides and assists in their phosphorylation. Here we present the crystal structure of an EIIC from Bacillus cereus that transports diacetylchitobiose. The EIIC is a homodimer, with an expansive interface formed between the amino-terminal halves of the two protomers. The carboxy-terminal half of each protomer has a large binding pocket that contains a diacetylchitobiose, which is occluded from both sides of the membrane with its site of phosphorylation near the conserved His250 and Glu334 residues. The structure shows the architecture of this important class of transporters, identifies the determinants of substrate binding and phosphorylation, and provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of sugar translocation.
During mouse embryogenesis, reversion of imprinted X chromosome inactivation in the pluripotent inner cell mass of the female blastocyst is initiated by the repression of Xist from the paternal X chromosome. Here we report that key factors supporting pluripotency-Nanog, Oct3/4, and Sox2-bind within Xist intron 1 in undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells. Whereas Nanog null ES cells display a reversible and moderate up-regulation of Xist in the absence of any apparent modification of Oct3/4 and Sox2 binding, the drastic release of all three factors from Xist intron 1 triggers rapid ectopic accumulation of Xist RNA. We conclude that the three main genetic factors underlying pluripotency cooperate to repress Xist and thus couple X inactivation reprogramming to the control of pluripotency during embryogenesis.
The formation of complexes between proteins and ligands is fundamental to biological processes at the molecular level. Manipulation of molecular recognition between ligands and proteins is therefore important for basic biological studies and has many biotechnological applications, including the construction of enzymes, biosensors, genetic circuits, signal transduction pathways and chiral separations. The systematic manipulation of binding sites remains a major challenge. Computational design offers enormous generality for engineering protein structure and function. Here we present a structure-based computational method that can drastically redesign protein ligand-binding specificities. This method was used to construct soluble receptors that bind trinitrotoluene, l-lactate or serotonin with high selectivity and affinity. These engineered receptors can function as biosensors for their new ligands; we also incorporated them into synthetic bacterial signal transduction pathways, regulating gene expression in response to extracellular trinitrotoluene or l-lactate. The use of various ligands and proteins shows that a high degree of control over biomolecular recognition has been established computationally. The biological and biosensing activities of the designed receptors illustrate potential applications of computational design.
Parallels between phylogeny and ontogeny have been discussed for almost two centuries, and a number of theories have been proposed to explain such patterns. Especially elusive is the phylotypic stage, a phase during development where species within a phylum are particularly similar to each other. Although this has formerly been interpreted as a recapitulation of phylogeny, it is now thought to reflect an ontogenetic progression phase, where strong constraints on developmental regulation and gene interactions exist. Several studies have shown that genes expressed during this stage evolve at a slower rate, but it has so far not been possible to derive an unequivocal molecular signature associated with this stage. Here we use a combination of phylostratigraphy and stage-specific gene expression data to generate a cumulative index that reflects the evolutionary age of the transcriptome at given ontogenetic stages. Using zebrafish ontogeny and adult development as a model, we find that the phylotypic stage does indeed express the oldest transcriptome set and that younger sets are expressed during early and late development, thus faithfully mirroring the hourglass model of morphological divergence. Reproductively active animals show the youngest transcriptome, with major differences between males and females. Notably, ageing animals express increasingly older genes. Comparisons with similar data sets from flies and nematodes show that this pattern occurs across phyla. Our results indicate that an old transcriptome marks the phylotypic phase and that phylogenetic differences at other ontogenetic stages correlate with the expression of newly evolved genes.
Computational tools can markedly accelerate the rate at which murine genetic models can be analyzed. We developed a computational method for mapping phenotypic traits that vary among inbred strains onto haplotypic blocks. This method correctly predicted the genetic basis for strain-specific differences in several biologically important traits. It was also used to identify an allele-specific functional genomic element regulating H2-Ealpha gene expression. This functional element, which contained the binding sites for YY1 and a second transcription factor that is probably serum response factor, is located within the first intron of the H2-Ealpha gene. This computational method will greatly improve our ability to identify the genetic basis for a variety of phenotypic traits, ranging from qualitative trait information to quantitative gene expression data, which vary among inbred mouse strains.
Some insects have cultivated intimate relationships with mutualistic bacteria since their early evolutionary history. Most ancient 'primary' endosymbionts live within the cytoplasm of large, polyploid host cells of a specialized organ (bacteriome). Within their large, ovoid bacteriomes, mealybugs (Pseudococcidae) package the intracellular endosymbionts into 'mucus-filled' spheres, which surround the host cell nucleus and occupy most of the cytoplasm. The genesis of symbiotic spheres has not been determined, and they are structurally unlike eukaryotic cell vesicles. Recent molecular phylogenetic and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies suggested that two unrelated bacterial species may share individual host cells, and that bacteria within spheres comprise these two species. Here we show that mealybug host cells do indeed harbour both beta- and gamma-subdivision Proteobacteria, but they are not co-inhabitants of the spheres. Rather, we show that the symbiotic spheres themselves are beta-proteobacterial cells. Thus, gamma-Proteobacteria live symbiotically inside beta-Proteobacteria. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of an intracellular symbiosis involving two species of bacteria.
Single base substitutions can be detected and localized by a simple and rapid method that involves ribonuclease cleavage of single base mismatches in RNA:DNA heteroduplexes. A 32P-labeled RNA probe complementary to wild-type DNA is synthesized in vitro and annealed to a test DNA containing a single base substitution. The resulting single base mismatch is cleaved by ribonuclease A, and the location of the mismatch is then determined by analyzing the sizes of the cleavage products by gel electrophoresis. Analysis of every type of mismatch in many different sequence contexts indicates that more than 50 percent of all single base substitutions can be detected. The feasibility of this method for localizing base substitutions directly in genomic DNA samples is demonstrated by the detection of single base mutations in DNA obtained from individuals with beta-thalassemia, a genetic disorder in beta-globin gene expression.
Maternal information stored in particular regions of the egg cytoplasm has an important function in the determination of developmental fate during early animal development. Ascidians show mosaic development; such autonomous development has been taken as evidence that prelocalized ooplasmic factors specify tissue precursor cells during embryogenesis. Interest has been concentrated on the mechanisms underlying the formation of muscle cells in the tail, as yellow-coloured myoplasm in eggs is preferentially segregated into muscle-lineage blastomeres. Here we show that maternal messenger RNA of the macho-1 gene is a determinant of muscle fate in the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi. The macho-1 mRNA encodes a zinc-finger protein, and the mRNA is localized to the myoplasm of eggs. Depletion of the mRNA specifically resulted in the loss of primary muscle cells in the tail, as shown by the expression of muscle-specific molecular markers. The myoplasm of macho-1-deficient eggs lost its ability to promote muscle formation. Injection of synthesized macho-1 mRNA caused ectopic muscle formation in non-muscle-lineage cells. Our results indicate that macho-1 maybe both required and sufficient for specification of muscle fate, and that the mRNA is a genuine, localized muscle determinant.
Retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma arise from cells that have lost both functional copies of the retinoblastoma gene. Using the cloned retinoblastoma gene and other linked polymorphic loci, it is possible to reconstruct the sequential loss of the two homologous gene copies that precedes the development of these tumours. In non-hereditary tumours, the loss of each of the two homologues occurs somatically; in hereditary cases, the initial mutation is in the germline. Recently, Toguchida et al. reported that the paternally derived copy is preferentially the first one to become mutant during the genesis of non-hereditary osteosarcomas. We report here a similar analysis of patients with retinoblastoma in which we find no such predilection for initial somatic mutations. In contrast, when an initial mutation was a new germline mutation, it was derived from the father, a result which is consistent with new germline mutations arising primarily during spermatogenesis.
The molecular basis for the anti-inflammatory property of intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) was investigated in a murine model of immune thrombocytopenia. Administration of clinically protective doses of intact antibody or monomeric Fc fragments to wild-type or Fcgamma receptor-humanized mice prevented platelet consumption triggered by a pathogenic autoantibody. The inhibitory Fc receptor, FcgammaRIIB, was required for protection, because disruption either by genetic deletion or with a blocking monoclonal antibody reversed the therapeutic effect of IVIG. Protection was associated with the ability of IVIG administration to induce surface expression of FcgammaRIIB on splenic macrophages. Modulation of inhibitory signaling is thus a potent therapeutic strategy for attenuating autoantibody-triggered inflammatory diseases.
We derive a general model, based on principles of biochemical kinetics and allometry, that characterizes the effects of temperature and body mass on metabolic rate. The model fits metabolic rates of microbes, ectotherms, endotherms (including those in hibernation), and plants in temperatures ranging from 0 degrees to 40 degrees C. Mass- and temperature-compensated resting metabolic rates of all organisms are similar: The lowest (for unicellular organisms and plants) is separated from the highest (for endothermic vertebrates) by a factor of about 20. Temperature and body size are primary determinants of biological time and ecological roles.
Many enzymes in plants have isozymes because the same catalytic reaction is often present in several subcellular compartments, most frequently the plastids and the cytosol. The number and subcellular locations of the isozymes appear to be highly conserved in plant evolution. However, gene duplication in diploid species and the addition of genomes in polyploid species have increased the number of isozymes.
Individuals with congenital or acquired prolongation of the QT interval, or long QT syndrome (LQTS), are at risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. LQTS is commonly genetic in origin but can also be caused or exacerbated by environmental factors. A missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(V)1.2 leads to LQTS in patients with Timothy syndrome. To explore the effect of the Timothy syndrome mutation on the electrical activity and contraction of human cardiomyocytes, we reprogrammed human skin cells from Timothy syndrome patients to generate induced pluripotent stem cells, and differentiated these cells into cardiomyocytes. Electrophysiological recording and calcium (Ca(2+)) imaging studies of these cells revealed irregular contraction, excess Ca(2+) influx, prolonged action potentials, irregular electrical activity and abnormal calcium transients in ventricular-like cells. We found that roscovitine, a compound that increases the voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca(V)1.2 (refs 6-8), restored the electrical and Ca(2+) signalling properties of cardiomyocytes from Timothy syndrome patients. This study provides new opportunities for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias in humans, and provides a robust assay for developing new drugs to treat these diseases.
In the hippocampus, which is phylogenetically older than the cerebral neocortex, high frequency stimulation of afferent pathways leads to long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission. This use-dependent malleability is of considerable interest because it may serve as a substrate for memory processes. However, in the neocortex, whose involvement in learning is undisputed, attempts to demonstrate LTP have remained inconclusive. Here we use intracellular recording techniques to show that LTP can be induced by high frequency stimulation of the optic radiation in slices of the visual cortex of adult rats. We identify as a necessary prerequisite for the induction of LTP the activation of the membrane channel that is associated with the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor. Selective blockade of this receptor system with DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate consistently prevents LTP as in most hippocampal pathways. In most cortical neurons the activation of the NMDA mechanism and hence the induction of LTP in these experiments requires a concomitant reduction of GABAergic inhibition by low doses of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline. This indicates that in the neocortex the activation threshold of the NMDA-mechanism and consequently the susceptibility to LTP, are strongly influenced by inhibitory processes.
Inclusive fitness models predict many commonly observed behaviours: among humans, studies of within-household violence, the allocation of food and child care find that people favour those to whom they are more closely related. In some cases however, kin-altruism effects appear to be modest. Do individuals favour kin to the extent that kin-altruism models predict? Data on remittances sent by South African migrant workers to their rural households of origin allow an explicit test, to our knowledge the first of its kind for humans. Using estimates of the fitness benefits and costs associated with the remittance, the genetic relatedness of the migrant to the beneficiaries of the transfer, and their age- and sex-specific reproductive values, we estimate the level of remittance that maximizes the migrant worker's inclusive fitness. This is a much better predictor of observed remittances than is average relatedness, even when we take account (by means of a multiple regression) of covarying influences on the level of remittance. But the effect is modest: less than a third of the observed level of remittances can be explained by our kin-altruism model.
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase that participates in numerous signalling pathways involved in diverse physiological processes. Several of these pathways are implicated in disease pathogenesis, which has prompted efforts to develop GSK3-specific inhibitors for therapeutic applications. However, before now, there has been no strong rationale for targeting GSK3 in malignancies. Here we report pharmacological, physiological and genetic studies that demonstrate an oncogenic requirement for GSK3 in the maintenance of a specific subtype of poor prognosis human leukaemia, genetically defined by mutations of the MLL proto-oncogene. In contrast to its previously characterized roles in suppression of neoplasia-associated signalling pathways, GSK3 paradoxically supports MLL leukaemia cell proliferation and transformation by a mechanism that ultimately involves destabilization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). Inhibition of GSK3 in a preclinical murine model of MLL leukaemia provides promising evidence of efficacy and earmarks GSK3 as a candidate cancer drug target.
Data are presented suggesting a resolution to the paradox concerning the murine response subregion I-J, which encodes a suppressor T cell marker. The controversy arose when sequences corresponding to I-J DNA were not found in the central immune response region described by immunogeneticists. New evidence is presented that T cell surface I-J expression results from the action of at least two complementing genes. One gene is within the H-2 region on chromosome 17; the second gene, termed Jt, is on chromosome 4. The two recombinant mouse strains B10.A(3R) and B10.A(5R) originally used to define the I-J subregion apparently differ not within the H-2 region but elsewhere.
Bacillus subtilis is the best-characterized member of the Gram-positive bacteria. Its genome of 4,214,810 base pairs comprises 4,100 protein-coding genes. Of these protein-coding genes, 53% are represented once, while a quarter of the genome corresponds to several gene families that have been greatly expanded by gene duplication, the largest family containing 77 putative ATP-binding transport proteins. In addition, a large proportion of the genetic capacity is devoted to the utilization of a variety of carbon sources, including many plant-derived molecules. The identification of five signal peptidase genes, as well as several genes for components of the secretion apparatus, is important given the capacity of Bacillus strains to secrete large amounts of industrially important enzymes. Many of the genes are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, that are more typically associated with Streptomyces species. The genome contains at least ten prophages or remnants of prophages, indicating that bacteriophage infection has played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer, in particular in the propagation of bacterial pathogenesis.
Initially a genetic oddity, male recombination in Drosophilaelanogaster is now being viewed as a means of detecting mutator activity and chromosome breakage in hybridising populations and is causing us to reconsider the source and rate at which genetic variability may be generated in nature.
BRCA1, BRCA2 and other known susceptibility genes account for less than half of the detectable hereditary predisposition to breast cancer. Other relevant genes therefore remain to be discovered. Recently a new BRCA2-binding protein, PALB2, was identified. The BRCA2-PALB2 interaction is crucial for certain key BRCA2 DNA damage response functions as well as its tumour suppression activity. Here we show, by screening for PALB2 mutations in Finland that a frameshift mutation, c.1592delT, is present at significantly elevated frequency in familial breast cancer cases compared with ancestry-matched population controls. The truncated PALB2 protein caused by this mutation retained little BRCA2-binding capacity and was deficient in homologous recombination and crosslink repair. Further screening of c.1592delT in unselected breast cancer individuals revealed a roughly fourfold enrichment of this mutation in patients compared with controls. Most of the mutation-positive unselected cases had a familial pattern of disease development. In addition, one multigenerational prostate cancer family that segregated the c.1592delT truncation allele was observed. These results indicate that PALB2 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene that, in a suitably mutant form, may also contribute to familial prostate cancer development.
The Bicoid (Bcd) gradient in Drosophila has long been a model for the action of a morphogen in establishing embryonic polarity. However, it is now clear that bcd is a unique feature of higher Diptera. An evolutionarily ancient gene, orthodenticle (otd), has a bcd-like role in the beetle Tribolium. Unlike the Bcd gradient, which arises by diffusion of protein from an anteriorly localized messenger RNA, the Tribolium Otd gradient forms by translational repression of otd mRNA by a posteriorly localized factor. These differences in gradient formation are correlated with differences in modes of embryonic patterning. Drosophila uses long germ embryogenesis, where the embryo derives from the entire anterior-posterior axis, and all segments are patterned at the blastoderm stage, before gastrulation. In contrast, Tribolium undergoes short germ embryogenesis: the embryo arises from cells in the posterior of the egg, and only anterior segments are patterned at the blastoderm stage, with the remaining segments arising after gastrulation from a growth zone. Here we describe the role of otd in the long germband embryo of the wasp Nasonia vitripennis. We show that Nasonia otd maternal mRNA is localized at both poles of the embryo, and resulting protein gradients pattern both poles. Thus, localized Nasonia otd has two major roles that allow long germ development. It activates anterior targets at the anterior of the egg in a manner reminiscent of the Bcd gradient, and it is required for pre-gastrulation expression of posterior gap genes.
Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for approximately 10% of all paediatric oncology deaths. To identify genetic risk factors for neuroblastoma, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2,251 patients and 6,097 control subjects of European ancestry from four case series. Here we report a significant association within LIM domain only 1 (LMO1) at 11p15.4 (rs110419, combined P = 5.2 x 10(-16), odds ratio of risk allele = 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.25-1.44)). The signal was enriched in the subset of patients with the most aggressive form of the disease. LMO1 encodes a cysteine-rich transcriptional regulator, and its paralogues (LMO2, LMO3 and LMO4) have each been previously implicated in cancer. In parallel, we analysed genome-wide DNA copy number alterations in 701 primary tumours. We found that the LMO1 locus was aberrant in 12.4% through a duplication event, and that this event was associated with more advanced disease (P < 0.0001) and survival (P = 0.041). The germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles and somatic copy number gains were associated with increased LMO1 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumours, consistent with a gain-of-function role in tumorigenesis. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of LMO1 inhibited growth of neuroblastoma cells with high LMO1 expression, whereas forced expression of LMO1 in neuroblastoma cells with low LMO1 expression enhanced proliferation. These data show that common polymorphisms at the LMO1 locus are strongly associated with susceptibility to developing neuroblastoma, but also may influence the likelihood of further somatic alterations at this locus, leading to malignant progression.
Segmentation of the Drosophila embryo depends on a hierarchy of interactions among the maternal and zygotic genes in the early embryo. The anterior region is organized maternally by the bicoid (bcd) gene product, which forms a concentration gradient in the anterior half of the embryo. The gap genes are also involved in establishing the body plan, with hunchback (hb) being expressed both maternally and zygotically. Zygotic expression of hb is directly activated by the bcd gene product, leading to a subdivision of the embryo into an anterior half expressing zygotically provided hb protein and a posterior half that does not. A similar effect on maternally provided hb protein is caused by the gene nanos, which represses the translation of maternally provided transcripts in the posterior half. This regulation of hb protein is a prerequisite for abdomen development, because the presence of hb protein in the posterior half represses posterior segmentation. This repression mechanism suggests that posterior segmentation might not directly depend on maternal positional cues, but be solely organized at the zygotic level. Here we report further evidence to support this hypothesis and show that the hb protein itself is crucially involved in organizing abdominal segmentation. Differential concentrations of hb protein determine the anterior and posterior borders of expression of the gap gene Kruppel (Kr) and the anterior border of the gap gene knirps (kni), thus defining three positional values. These regulatory pathways are controlled in a redundant way, in part by bcd and in part by the maternal hb gene product.
The extent of gene regulation in cell differentiation is poorly understood. We previously used saturation mutagenesis to identify 18 genes that are needed for the development and function of a single type of sensory neuron--the touch receptor neuron for gentle touch in Caenorhabditis elegans. One of these genes, mec-3, encodes a transcription factor that controls touch receptor differentiation. By culturing and isolating wild-type and mec-3 mutant cells from embryos and applying their amplified RNA to DNA microarrays, here we have identified genes that are known to be expressed in touch receptors, a previously uncloned gene (mec-17) that is needed for maintaining touch receptor differentiation, and more than 50 previously unknown mec-3-dependent genes. These genes are randomly distributed in the genome and under-represented both for genes that are co-expressed in operons and for multiple members of gene families. Using regions 5' of the start codon of the first 20 genes, we have also identified an over-represented heptanucleotide, AATGCAT, that is needed for the expression of touch receptor genes.
An insidious increase in features of the 'metabolic syndrome' - obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia -- has conspired to produce a worldwide epidemic of type 2 insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus. Most current therapies for this disease were developed in the absence of defined molecular targets or an understanding of disease pathogenesis. Emerging knowledge of key pathogenic mechanisms, such as the impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and the role of 'lipotoxicity' as a probable cause of hepatic and muscle resistance to insulin's effects on glucose metabolism, has led to a host of new molecular drug targets. Several have been validated through genetic engineering in mice or the preliminary use of lead compounds and therapeutic agents in animals and humans.
X-ray tomography is an invaluable tool in biomedical imaging. It can deliver the three-dimensional internal structure of entire organisms as well as that of single cells, and even gives access to quantitative information, crucially important both for medical applications and for basic research. Most frequently such information is based on X-ray attenuation. Phase contrast is sometimes used for improved visibility but remains significantly harder to quantify. Here we describe an X-ray computed tomography technique that generates quantitative high-contrast three-dimensional electron density maps from phase contrast information without reverting to assumptions of a weak phase object or negligible absorption. This method uses a ptychographic coherent imaging approach to record tomographic data sets, exploiting both the high penetration power of hard X-rays and the high sensitivity of lensless imaging. As an example, we present images of a bone sample in which structures on the 100 nm length scale such as the osteocyte lacunae and the interconnective canalicular network are clearly resolved. The recovered electron density map provides a contrast high enough to estimate nanoscale bone density variations of less than one per cent. We expect this high-resolution tomography technique to provide invaluable information for both the life and materials sciences.
Receptors for immunoglobulin G immune complexes (Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII) are expressed on most hematopoietic cells and show much structural and functional diversity. In order to determine the genetic basis for this diversity, a family of genes encoding the human and mouse receptors was isolated and characterized. Humans have five distinct genes for low-affinity Fc gamma Rs, in contrast to two in the mouse. With the use of yeast artificial chromosomes, the genes encoding the human receptors were oriented and linked, which established the structure of this complex locus. Comparison of the human and mouse genes generated a model for the evolutionary amplification of this locus.
Reciprocal transplants of genetically identical fragments of intertidal sponges between environments of high and low wave action exhibit great variability in the timing of their responses to environmental change. Sponges quickly begin production of stiffer and stronger tissues in high wave energy environments but delay formation of new, weak tissues in calm habitats. This may be due to the risks of forming wave-intolerant tissue in a temporally variable, unpredictable environment. These results suggest that the evolution of acclimatory control is linked to environmental predictability and concomitantly to risks of acclimatory errors.
The mechanisms underlying the low efficiency of reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are poorly understood. There is a clear need to study whether the reprogramming process itself compromises genomic integrity and, through this, the efficiency of iPS cell establishment. Using a high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array, we compared copy number variations (CNVs) of different passages of human iPS cells with their fibroblast cell origins and with human embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we show that significantly more CNVs are present in early-passage human iPS cells than intermediate passage human iPS cells, fibroblasts or human ES cells. Most CNVs are formed de novo and generate genetic mosaicism in early-passage human iPS cells. Most of these novel CNVs rendered the affected cells at a selective disadvantage. Remarkably, expansion of human iPS cells in culture selects rapidly against mutated cells, driving the lines towards a genetic state resembling human ES cells.
The activation of some subsets of T cells requires the recognition of antigen in association with self Ia determinants. It is not clear, however, whether this is also necessary for the induction of unresponsiveness and the active suppression of hapten-specific T cells. We have studied the regulation of the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in mice. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of haptenated syngeneic cells primarily activates T helper cells, while intravenous (i.v.) injection results in unresponsiveness and the activation of T suppressor cells. Presentation of antigen by an I-A-positive antigen-presenting cell (APC) seems to be critical for T helper cell activation. We now show that the activation of first-order T suppressor cells requires the presentation of hapten on an I-J-positive APC. However, i.v. injection of I-J-depleted haptenated cells also results in hepten-specific unresponsiveness. This non-transferable T-cell tolerance requires the presence of an I-A-positive APC and is genetically restricted. These results suggest that distinct modes of antigen presentation and administration are required for immunity, suppression and non-transferable tolerance.
Human primary skin fibroblasts trisomic for chromosome 13, 18, or 21 and diploid human skin fibroblasts were induced for an antiviral response with human interferon. The cells that were trisomnic for chromosome 21 were three to seven times more sensitive to protection by human interferon than the normal diploid or trisomic 18 or 13 fibroblasts. The differential response in trisomnic 21 cells is consistent with the known assignment of the human antiviral gene to chromosome 21.
Distinct modifications of histone amino termini, such as acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation, have been proposed to underlie a chromatin-based regulatory mechanism that modulates the accessibility of genetic information. In addition to histone modifications that facilitate gene activity, it is of similar importance to restrict inappropriate gene expression if cellular and developmental programmes are to proceed unperturbed. Here we show that mammalian methyltransferases that selectively methylate histone H3 on lysine 9 (Suv39h HMTases) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins--a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene silencing and supra-nucleosomal chromatin structure. High-affinity in vitro recognition of a methylated histone H3 peptide by HP1 requires a functional chromo domain; thus, the HP1 chromo domain is a specific interaction motif for the methyl epitope on lysine9 of histone H3. In vivo, heterochromatin association of HP1 proteins is lost in Suv39h double-null primary mouse fibroblasts but is restored after the re-introduction of a catalytically active SWUV39H1 HMTase. Our data define a molecular mechanism through which the SUV39H-HP1 methylation system can contribute to the propagation of heterochromatic subdomains in native chromatin.
In humans genetically predisposed to malignant hyperthermia, anesthesia can induce skeletal muscle rigidity, hypermetabolism, and high fever, which, if not immediately reversed, can lead to tissue damage or death. The corresponding condition in swine leads to stress-induced deaths and devalued meat products. Abnormalities in the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (the ryanodine receptor) have been implicated in the cause of both the porcine and human syndromes by physiological and biochemical studies and genetic linkage analysis. In swine, a single founder mutation in the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) can account for all cases of malignant hyperthermia in all breeds, but a series of different RYR1 mutations are likely to be uncovered in human families with MH. Moreover, lack of linkage between malignant hyperthermia and RYR1 in some families indicates a heterogeneous genetic basis for the human syndrome.
Early dormancy involves a number of phenomena: cessation of active growth, formation of terminal buds, formation of abscission layers in leaves, development of cold resistance, development of winter rest (a chilling requirement), and leaf fall. The buds of some tree species (or some races of a species) have a true rest or winter chilling requirement; usually the roots do not; perhaps the cambium does not. There is a wide range of genetic variation within and between species in response to photoperiod, winter chilling, water nutrients, and other environmental factors which affect the dormancy condition of plants. During the period of winter rest there are many metabolic and developmental processes going on in the buds and twigs. These processes include respiration, photosynthesis, some cell division, enzyme synthesis, production of growth stimulators, and dissipation of growth inhibitors. Dormancy of trees can be divided arbitrarily into three phases: early rest, winter rest, and after-rest. Each of these phases is marked by a distinct set of physiological processes. The transition between the three phases is gradual. Some processes of after-rest can proceed even though the winter chilling requirement (winter rest) of a tree has not been completed fully. Evidence from grafting experiments and chemical treatments to break winter rest, and studies of genetic variability indicate that the processes and phenomena of dormancy are at least partially independent of each other. Different buds and branches and other parts of the same plant may initiate dormancy, break dormancy, and renew vegetative growth independently. Initiation and cessation of dormancy can be triggered by a number of environmental variables: photoperiod, temperature, nutrition, water, an array of chemicals, and shock treatments. Dormancy regulation must either involve a variety of receptors or involve receptors that are responsive to a variety of stimuli. Unless dormancy is defined in a highly restricted sense (that is, possession of chilling requirement), it is hard to conceive of a single receptor or regulator that controls all of the phenomena of dormancy. A large number of genes are definitely involved and hence a large number of enzymes. The kinds of enzymes, their numbers, and their concentrations can be regulated by manipulating the environment.
One mechanism which generates diversity in immunoglobulin variable (V) regions is flexibility in the site of recombination among the constituent genetic elements. Within a specific antibody family (that is, a particular VH-VL combination), variability in V-D-J rearrangement not only leads to sequence diversity at the boundary of the juxtaposed genes, but also enables the total length of the third complementarity-determining region (CDR-3) of the heavy chain to be conserved. We demonstrate here that the junctional diversity inherent in rearranged immunoglobulin genes can have consequences for the biology of the immune system. Sequence analysis of the expressed immunoglobulin genes of idiotypically variant as opposed to conventional B lymphocytes of a dominant antibody family showed that the variant B cells undergo a novel D-JH joining event such that an extra amino acid is inserted into the heavy chain CDR-3. The unique D-region conformation possessed by the variant B cells accounts for previous observations which showed that variant and conventional B cells could be differentially regulated in vivo by an autologous set of idiotope-specific B lymphocytes. Our findings indicate that D-region structure can determine the expression of regulatory idiotopes and suggest that the conservation of heavy-chain CDR-3 length within an antibody family may reflect regulatory as well as functional constraints.
Germ cells are the only cells that transmit genetic information to the next generation, and they therefore must be prevented from differentiating inappropriately into somatic cells. A common mechanism by which germline progenitors are protected from differentiation-inducing signals is a transient and global repression of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent transcription. In both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, the repression of messenger RNA transcription during germ cell specification correlates with an absence of phosphorylation of Ser 2 residues in the carboxy-terminal domain of RNAPII (hereafter called CTD), a critical modification for transcriptional elongation. Here we show that, in Drosophila embryos, a small protein encoded by polar granule component (pgc) is essential for repressing CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation in newly formed pole cells, the germline progenitors. Ectopic Pgc expression in somatic cells is sufficient to repress CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Pgc interacts, physically and genetically, with positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), the CTD Ser 2 kinase complex, and prevents its recruitment to transcription sites. These results indicate that Pgc is a cell-type-specific P-TEFb inhibitor that has a fundamental role in Drosophila germ cell specification. In C. elegans embryos, PIE-1 protein segregates to germline blastomeres, and is thought to repress mRNA transcription through interaction with P-TEFb. Thus, inhibition of P-TEFb is probably a common mechanism during germ cell specification in the disparate organisms C. elegans and Drosophila.
Over the past two decades, the small soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has become established as a major model system for the study of a great variety of problems in biology and medicine. One of its most significant advantages is its simplicity, both in anatomy and in genomic organization. The entire haploid genetic content amounts to 100 million base pairs of DNA, about 1/30 the size of the human value. As a result, C. elegans has also provided a pilot system for the construction of physical maps of larger animal and plant genomes, and subsequently for the complete sequencing of those genomes. By mid-1995, approximately one-fifth of the complete DNA sequence of this animal had been determined. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a test bed not only for the development and application of mapping and sequencing technologies, but also for the interpretation and use of complete sequence information. This article reviews the progress so far toward a realizable goal--the total description of the genome of a simple animal.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) comprise a range of disorders that share a core of neurobehavioural deficits characterized by widespread abnormalities in social interactions, deficits in communication as well as restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. The neurological basis and circuitry mechanisms underlying these abnormal behaviours are poorly understood. SHANK3 is a postsynaptic protein, whose disruption at the genetic level is thought to be responsible for the development of 22q13 deletion syndrome (Phelan-McDermid syndrome) and other non-syndromic ASDs. Here we show that mice with Shank3 gene deletions exhibit self-injurious repetitive grooming and deficits in social interaction. Cellular, electrophysiological and biochemical analyses uncovered defects at striatal synapses and cortico-striatal circuits in Shank3 mutant mice. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for SHANK3 in the normal development of neuronal connectivity and establish causality between a disruption in the Shank3 gene and the genesis of autistic-like behaviours in mice.
Tabby (Ta), a murine X-linked mutant gene, produces a syndrome of ectodermal dysplasia including anhidrosis (absence of sweat glands). Development of sweat glands is related to that of dermal ridges (dermatoglyphics) and abnormal ridges may be associated with absence of sweat glands in the human syndrome of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED). We have found that dermal ridges occur in normal mice but are lacking in Ta mutants. Previously we showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) reverses delayed eyelid opening and incisor eruption in Ta mice. We now report that EGF induces development of dermal ridges and functional sweat glands in Ta/Y hemizygotes, indicating a role in mammalian morphogenesis. Ta seems to be genetically homologous to human X-linked HED, as Ta maps close to loci homologous to linkage markers of HED and the two syndromes share many traits, including absence of all or most sweat glands. Absence of these glands causes hyperpyrexia, a clinical emergency in infants with HED; reversal of the trait in the mouse homologue of the disease indicates that an important genetically determined congenital defect in humans may become treatable.
The HMR E silencer represses transcription of silent mating-type genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and contains three redundant regulatory elements A, E and B (ref. 1). The A element contains the 11 base pair consensus sequence that is essential for the firing of DNA replication origins. A multisubunit protein called the origin recognition complex (ORC) binds specifically to this consensus sequence within yeast origins in vitro and in vivo. We isolated mutants in A element-mediated silencing and report here that one of the genes we identified, RRR1, encodes ORC2, the 72K subunit of ORC. RRR1/ORC2 is an essential gene, but the rrr1-316 allele, which is viable, is defective in the replication of nuclear DNA and the maintenance of the 2-microns episomal DNA. This is, to our knowledge, the first genetic evidence that ORC is involved in DNA replication and silencing.
The ways that taxonomic differences in morphology, behaviour or life history are related to each other and to differences in lifestyle have been used regularly to test ideas about the selective forces involved in their evolution. Such comparative tests have been transformed recently by using increased statistical rigour. The realization that the statistical model against which comparisons are made is a model of how evolution proceeds, forms the basis of a new generation of comparative tests that are grounded properly on phylogenetic reconstruction.
Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomeromycota) are thought to be the oldest group of asexual multicellular organisms. They colonize the roots of most land plants, where they facilitate mineral uptake from the soil in exchange for plant-assimilated carbon. Cells of AM fungi contain hundreds of nuclei. Unusual polymorphism of ribosomal DNA observed in individual spores of AM fungi inspired a hypothesis that heterokaryosis--that is, the coexistence of many dissimilar nuclei in cells--occurs throughout the AM fungal life history. Here we report a genetic approach to test the hypothesis of heterokaryosis in AM fungi. Our study of the transmission of polymorphic genetic markers in natural isolates of Glomus etunicatum, coupled with direct amplification of rDNA from microdissected nuclei by polymerase chain reaction, supports the alternative hypothesis of homokaryosis, in which nuclei populating AM fungal individuals are genetically uniform. Intrasporal rDNA polymorphism contained in each nucleus signals a relaxation of concerted evolution, a recombination-driven process that is responsible for homogenizing rDNA repeats. Polyploid organization of glomeromycotan genomes could accommodate intranuclear rDNA polymorphism and buffer these apparently asexual organisms against the effects of accumulating mutations.
The performance of a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell was studied using a ceria-based solid electrolyte at temperatures below 773 kelvin. Electromotive forces of approximately 900 millivolts were generated from the cell in a flowing mixture of ethane or propane and air, where the solid electrolyte functioned as a purely ionic conductor. The electrode-reaction resistance was negligibly small in the total internal resistances of the cell. The resulting peak power density reached 403 and 101 milliwatts per square centimeter at 773 and 623 kelvin, respectively.
Half a century ago, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) at the distal tip of the tetrapod limb bud was shown to produce signals necessary for development along the proximal-distal (P-D) axis, but how these signals influence limb patterning is still much debated. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) gene family members are key AER-derived signals, with Fgf4, Fgf8, Fgf9 and Fgf17 expressed specifically in the mouse AER. Here we demonstrate that mouse limbs lacking Fgf4, Fgf9 and Fgf17 have normal skeletal pattern, indicating that Fgf8 is sufficient among AER-FGFs to sustain normal limb formation. Inactivation of Fgf8 alone causes a mild skeletal phenotype; however, when we also removed different combinations of the other AER-FGF genes, we obtained unexpected skeletal phenotypes of increasing severity, reflecting the contribution that each FGF can make to the total AER-FGF signal. Analysis of the compound mutant limb buds revealed that, in addition to sustaining cell survival, AER-FGFs regulate P-D-patterning gene expression during early limb bud development, providing genetic evidence that AER-FGFs function to specify a distal domain and challenging the long-standing hypothesis that AER-FGF signalling is permissive rather than instructive for limb patterning. We discuss how a two-signal model for P-D patterning can be integrated with the concept of early specification to explain the genetic data presented here.
The development of cell polarity is an essential prerequisite for tissue morphogenesis during embryogenesis, particularly in the development of epithelia. In addition, oriented cell division can have a powerful influence on tissue morphogenesis. Here we identify a novel mode of polarized cell division that generates pairs of neural progenitors with mirror-symmetric polarity in the developing zebrafish neural tube and has dramatic consequences for the organization of embryonic tissue. We show that during neural rod formation the polarity protein Pard3 is localized to the cleavage furrow of dividing progenitors, and then mirror-symmetrically inherited by the two daughter cells. This allows the daughter cells to integrate into opposite sides of the developing neural tube. Furthermore, these mirror-symmetric divisions have powerful morphogenetic influence: when forced to occur in ectopic locations during neurulation, they orchestrate the development of mirror-image pattern formation and the consequent generation of ectopic neural tubes.
Genomewide DNA rearrangements occur in many eukaryotes during development, but their functions and mechanisms are poorly understood. Previous studies have implicated a sequence-recognition mechanism based on RNA-mediated interactions between nuclei in ciliated protozoa. In this study, we found that the process recognized and deleted a foreign gene integrated in a Tetrahymena chromosome, suggesting an unusual mechanism of genome surveillance. We further found that injection of double-stranded RNA into the cell at specific developmental stages triggers efficient deletion of the targeted genomic regions. Together the results indicate an RNA-based mechanism that directs genomewide DNA rearrangements and serves to disable invading genetic agents.
Stem cell biology has come of age. Unequivocal proof that stem cells exist in the haematopoietic system has given way to the prospective isolation of several tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells, the initial delineation of their properties and expressed genetic programmes, and the beginnings of their utility in regenerative medicine. Perhaps the most important and useful property of stem cells is that of self-renewal. Through this property, striking parallels can be found between stem cells and cancer cells: tumours may often originate from the transformation of normal stem cells, similar signalling pathways may regulate self-renewal in stem cells and cancer cells, and cancer cells may include 'cancer stem cells' - rare cells with indefinite potential for self-renewal that drive tumorigenesis.
What is it that defines an animal? The definition provided here, made on the basis of developmental biology, suggests methods for resolving phylogenetic problems.
Population genetic analyses that depend on the assumption of neutrality for allozyme markers are used widely. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms in nuclear DNA of the American oyster evidence a pronounced population subdivision concordant with mitochondrial DNA. This finding contrasts with a geographic uniformity in allozyme frequencies previously thought to reflect high gene flow mediated by the pelagic gametes and larvae. The discordance likely is due to selection on protein electrophoretic characters that balances allozyme frequencies in the face of severe constraints to gene flow. These results raise a cautionary note for studies that rely on assumptions of neutrality for allozyme markers.
In somatic cells of female mammals one of the two X chromosomes is genetically inactive and heterochromatic, resulting in dosage compensation for X-linked genes. In marsupials the paternally derived X chromosome is preferentially inactivated. In eutherian mammals, although either X chromosome can be inactivated at random in somatic cells, preferential inactivation of the paternally derived X chromosome has been demonstrated cytologically in mouse and rat yolk sac and mouse chorion and biochemically in mouse yolk sac, chorionic ectoderm and trophoblast. In mouse yolk sac the non-random element has been shown both biochemically and cytologically to be confined to the endoderm layer in which there is almost total paternal X-chromosome activity in the separated yolk sac layers of diploid parthenogenetic mouse embryos in which both X chromosomes are maternally derived. Kaufman et al. have demonstrated X inactivation in somatic cells of diploid parthenogenetic embryos, and we have used a modification of Kanda's method, which renders the presumptive inactive X dark staining, to reveal an inactive X chromosome in both endoderm and mesoderm layers of separated yolk sacs from parthenogenones. Thus even in tissues in which there is normally total non-random paternal X inactivation, in the absence of a paternally derived X chromosome a maternally derived X can be inactivated.
In Xenopus, cells from the animal hemisphere are competent to form mesodermal tissues from the morula through to the blastula stage. Loss of mesodermal competence at early gastrula is programmed cell-autonomously, and occurs even in single cells at the appropriate stage. To determine the mechanism by which this occurs, we have been investigating a concomitant, global change in expression of H1 linker histone subtypes. H1 histones are usually considered to be general repressors of transcription, but in Xenopus they are increasingly thought to have selective functions in transcriptional regulation. Xenopus eggs and embryos at stages before the midblastula transition are deficient in histone H1 protein, but contain an oocyte-specific variant called histone B4 or H1M. After the midblastula transition, histone B4 is progressively substituted by three somatic histone H1 variants, and replacement is complete by early neurula. Here we report that accumulation of somatic H1 protein is rate limiting for the loss of mesodermal competence. This involves selective transcriptional silencing of regulatory genes required for mesodermal differentiation pathways, like muscle, by somatic, but not maternal, H1 protein.
The structurally related natural products rapamycin and FK506 bind to the same intracellular receptor, FKBP12, yet the resulting complexes interfere with distinct signalling pathways. FKBP12-rapamycin inhibits progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle in osteosarcoma, liver and T cells as well as in yeast, and interferes with mitogenic signalling pathways that are involved in G1 progression, namely with activation of the protein p70S6k (refs 5, 11-13) and cyclin-dependent kinases. Here we isolate a mammalian FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP) whose binding to structural variants of rapamycin complexed to FKBP12 correlates with the ability of these ligands to inhibit cell-cycle progression. Peptide sequences from purified bovine FRAP were used to isolate a human cDNA clone that is highly related to the DRR1/TOR1 and DRR2/TOR2 gene products from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although it has not been previously demonstrated that either of the DRR/TOR gene products can bind the FKBP-rapamycin complex directly, these yeast genes have been genetically linked to a rapamycin-sensitive pathway and are thought to encode lipid kinases.
Myelodysplastic syndromes and related disorders (myelodysplasia) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms showing deregulated blood cell production with evidence of myeloid dysplasia and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia, whose pathogenesis is only incompletely understood. Here we report whole-exome sequencing of 29 myelodysplasia specimens, which unexpectedly revealed novel pathway mutations involving multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery, including U2AF35, ZRSR2, SRSF2 and SF3B1. In a large series analysis, these splicing pathway mutations were frequent (~45 to ~85%) in, and highly specific to, myeloid neoplasms showing features of myelodysplasia. Conspicuously, most of the mutations, which occurred in a mutually exclusive manner, affected genes involved in the 3'-splice site recognition during pre-mRNA processing, inducing abnormal RNA splicing and compromised haematopoiesis. Our results provide the first evidence indicating that genetic alterations of the major splicing components could be involved in human pathogenesis, also implicating a novel therapeutic possibility for myelodysplasia.
Flowering time is a complex trait that controls adaptation of plants to their local environment in the outcrossing species Zea mays (maize). We dissected variation for flowering time with a set of 5000 recombinant inbred lines (maize Nested Association Mapping population, NAM). Nearly a million plants were assayed in eight environments but showed no evidence for any single large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Instead, we identified evidence for numerous small-effect QTLs shared among families; however, allelic effects differ across founder lines. We identified no individual QTLs at which allelic effects are determined by geographic origin or large effects for epistasis or environmental interactions. Thus, a simple additive model accurately predicts flowering time for maize, in contrast to the genetic architecture observed in the selfing plant species rice and Arabidopsis.
Erythromycin binds specifically to the 52S subunit of the chloroplast ribosome of Chlamydomonas reinhardi. A number of erythromycin-resistant mutants whose ribosomes have lost their affinity for the antibiotic have been isolated, but the sedimentation properties of their ribosomes are indistinguishable from those of the wild-type strain. These mutants represent at least three genetic loci. Two of them show Mendelian inheritance, and one of them is inherited in a uniparental manner.
A partial amino acid sequence obtained for porcine atrial muscarinic acetylcholine receptor was used to isolate complementary DNA clones containing the complete receptor coding region. The deduced 466-amino acid polypeptide exhibits extensive structural and sequence homology with other receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins (for example, the beta-adrenergic receptor and rhodopsins); this similarity predicts a structure of seven membrane-spanning regions distinguished by the disposition of a large cytoplasmic domain. Stable transfection of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line with the atrial receptor complementary DNA leads to the binding of muscarinic antagonists in these cells with affinities characteristic of the M2 receptor subtype. The atrial muscarinic receptor is encoded by a unique gene consisting of a single coding exon and multiple, alternatively spliced 5' noncoding regions. The atrial receptor is distinct from the cerebral muscarinic receptor gene product, sharing only 38% overall amino acid homology and possessing a completely nonhomologous large cytoplasmic domain, suggesting a role for the latter region in differential effector coupling.
Heterozygosity occurs at the lactate dehydrogenase b-locus in two diploid parthenogenetic species of Cnemidophorus. Each such species produces two different B subunits, one of which is also found in two sexual species and in two triploid parthenogenetic species; the other occurs also in a third sexual species. Interspecific hybridization between sexual species carrying different b-alleles and producing different B subunits may be responsible for the heterozygosity at the lactate dehydrogenase b-locus in diploid parthenogenetic Cnemidophours.
In neural systems, information is often carried by ensembles of cells rather than by individual units. Optical indicators provide a powerful means to reveal such distributed activity, particularly when protein-based and encodable in DNA: encodable probes can be introduced into cells, tissues, or transgenic organisms by genetic manipulation, selectively expressed in anatomically or functionally defined groups of cells, and, ideally, recorded in situ, without a requirement for exogenous cofactors. Here we describe sensors for secretion and neurotransmission that fulfil these criteria. We have developed pH-sensitive mutants of green fluorescent protein ('pHluorins') by structure-directed combinatorial mutagenesis, with the aim of exploiting the acidic pH inside secretory vesicles to monitor vesicle exocytosis and recycling. When linked to a vesicle membrane protein, pHluorins were sorted to secretory and synaptic vesicles and reported transmission at individual synaptic boutons, as well as secretion and fusion pore 'flicker' of single secretory granules.
We present acoustic images of oceanic thermohaline structure created from marine seismic reflection profiles across the major oceanographic front between the Labrador Current and the North Atlantic Current. The images show that distinct water masses can be mapped, and their internal structure imaged, using low-frequency acoustic reflections from sound speed contrasts at interfaces across which temperature changes. The warm/cold front is characterized by east-dipping reflections generated by thermohaline intrusions in the uppermost 1000 meters of the ocean. Our results imply that marine seismic reflection techniques can provide excellent spatial resolution of important oceanic phenomena, including thermohaline intrusions, internal waves, and eddies.
In the heart, catecholamines affect pacemaker activity by shifting the activation curve for the nonspecific inward current and increasing both the calcium current, and the delayed potassium current. We report here that in mammalian ventricle there is another mechanism that seems to involve a sodium-dependent inward current. This is elicited by agents that increase intracellular cyclic AMP concentration, such as the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline, and is unaffected by agents which block the three currents listed above, but is absent when external sodium is replaced with tetramethylammonium. Most interestingly, the intracellular pathway(s) linking the beta-receptor(s) to activation of the Ca current and the Na-dependent current, which in both cases presumably involves the intracellular concentration of cAMP, differ, as isoprenaline causes a persistent augmentation of the calcium current whereas the Na-dependent current often fades. These effects of isoprenaline are antagonized by acetylcholine. In unclamped cells, the Na-dependent current depolarizes the membrane to the potential range at which repetitive firing occurs. It may therefore be involved in the generation of ventricular arrhythmias.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common, highly heritable neurodevelopmental condition characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity. Thus, a fundamental question is whether autism represents an aetiologically heterogeneous disorder in which the myriad genetic or environmental risk factors perturb common underlying molecular pathways in the brain. Here, we demonstrate consistent differences in transcriptome organization between autistic and normal brain by gene co-expression network analysis. Remarkably, regional patterns of gene expression that typically distinguish frontal and temporal cortex are significantly attenuated in the ASD brain, suggesting abnormalities in cortical patterning. We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1 (also known as FOX1), and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing we demonstrate dysregulated splicing of A2BP1-dependent alternative exons in the ASD brain. Moreover, using a published autism genome-wide association study (GWAS) data set, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for genetically associated variants, providing independent support for the causal involvement of these genes in autism. In contrast, the immune-glial module showed no enrichment for autism GWAS signals, indicating a non-genetic aetiology for this process. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence for convergent molecular abnormalities in ASD, and implicate transcriptional and splicing dysregulation as underlying mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction in this disorder.
The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors has important roles in the development and function of T cells, neuronal cells and muscle cells. MEF2 is capable of repressing or activating transcription by association with a variety of co-repressors or co-activators in a calcium-dependent manner. Transcriptional repression by MEF2 has attracted particular attention because of its potential role in hypertrophic responses of cardiomyocytes. Several MEF2 co-repressors, such as Cabin1/Cain and class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), have been identified. However, the molecular mechanism of their recruitment to specific promoters by MEF2 remains largely unknown. Here we report a crystal structure of the MADS-box/MEF2S domain of human MEF2B bound to a motif of the transcriptional co-repressor Cabin1 and DNA at 2.2 A resolution. The crystal structure reveals a stably folded MEF2S domain on the surface of the MADS box. Cabin1 adopts an amphipathic alpha-helix to bind a hydrophobic groove on the MEF2S domain, forming a triple-helical interaction. Our studies of the ternary Cabin1/MEF2/DNA complex show a general mechanism by which MEF2 recruits transcriptional co-repressor Cabin1 and class II HDACs to specific DNA sites.
Two genes, Idd-3 and Idd-4, that influence the onset of autoimmune type 1 diabetes in the nonobese diabetic mouse have been located on chromosomes 3 and 11, outside the chromosome 17 major histocompatibility complex. A genetic map of the mouse genome, analysed using the polymerase chain reaction, has been assembled specifically for the study. On the basis of comparative maps of the mouse and human genomes, the homologue of Idd-3 may reside on human chromosomes 1 or 4 and Idd-4 on chromosome 17.
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by features reminiscent of marked premature ageing. Here, we present evidence of mutations in lamin A (LMNA) as the cause of this disorder. The HGPS gene was initially localized to chromosome 1q by observing two cases of uniparental isodisomy of 1q-the inheritance of both copies of this material from one parent-and one case with a 6-megabase paternal interstitial deletion. Sequencing of LMNA, located in this interval and previously implicated in several other heritable disorders, revealed that 18 out of 20 classical cases of HGPS harboured an identical de novo (that is, newly arisen and not inherited) single-base substitution, G608G(GGC > GGT), within exon 11. One additional case was identified with a different substitution within the same codon. Both of these mutations result in activation of a cryptic splice site within exon 11, resulting in production of a protein product that deletes 50 amino acids near the carboxy terminus. Immunofluorescence of HGPS fibroblasts with antibodies directed against lamin A revealed that many cells show visible abnormalities of the nuclear membrane. The discovery of the molecular basis of this disease may shed light on the general phenomenon of human ageing.
Internal brain states form key determinants for sensory perception, sensorimotor coordination and learning. A prominent reflection of different brain states in the mammalian central nervous system is the presence of distinct patterns of cortical synchrony, as revealed by extracellular recordings of the electroencephalogram, local field potential and action potentials. Such temporal correlations of cortical activity are thought to be fundamental mechanisms of neuronal computation. However, it is unknown how cortical synchrony is reflected in the intracellular membrane potential (V(m)) dynamics of behaving animals. Here we show, using dual whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 primary somatosensory barrel cortex in behaving mice, that the V(m) of nearby neurons is highly correlated during quiet wakefulness. However, when the mouse is whisking, an internally generated state change reduces the V(m) correlation, resulting in a desynchronized local field potential and electroencephalogram. Action potential activity was sparse during both quiet wakefulness and active whisking. Single action potentials were driven by a large, brief and specific excitatory input that was not present in the V(m) of neighbouring cells. Action potential initiation occurs with a higher signal-to-noise ratio during active whisking than during quiet periods. Therefore, we show that an internal brain state dynamically regulates cortical membrane potential synchrony during behaviour and defines different modes of cortical processing.
Small molecules that affect specific protein functions can be valuable tools for dissecting complex cellular processes. Peptidoglycan synthesis and degradation is a process in bacteria that involves multiple enzymes under strict temporal and spatial regulation. We used a set of small molecules that inhibit the transglycosylation step of peptidoglycan synthesis to discover genes that help to regulate this process. We identified a gene responsible for the susceptibility of Escherichia coli cells to killing by glycolipid derivatives of vancomycin, thus establishing a genetic basis for activity differences between these compounds and vancomycin.
Despite strong evidence to the contrary, speculation continues that the AIDS virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), may have crossed into humans as a result of contamination of the oral polio vaccine (OPV). This 'OPV/AIDS theory' claims that chimpanzees from the vicinity of Stanleyville--now Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of Congo--were the source of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) that was transmitted to humans when chimpanzee tissues were allegedly used in the preparation of OPV. Here we show that SIVcpz is indeed endemic in wild chimpanzees of this region but that the circulating virus is phylogenetically distinct from all strains of HIV-1, providing direct evidence that these chimpanzees were not the source of the human AIDS pandemic.
Body size and temperature are the two most important variables affecting nearly all biological rates and times. The relationship of size and temperature to development is of particular interest, because during ontogeny size changes and temperature often varies. Here we derive a general model, based on first principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics, that predicts the time of ontogenetic development as a function of body mass and temperature. The model fits embryonic development times spanning a wide range of egg sizes and incubation temperatures for birds and aquatic ectotherms (fish, amphibians, aquatic insects and zooplankton). The model also describes nearly 75% of the variation in post-embryonic development among a diverse sample of zooplankton. The remaining variation is partially explained by stoichiometry, specifically the whole-body carbon to phosphorus ratio. Development in other animals at other life stages is also described by this model. These results suggest a general definition of biological time that is approximately invariant and common to all organisms.
Most theories of the origin of biological organization assume that polymers with lengths in the range of 30-60 monomers are needed to make a genetic system viable. But it has not proved possible to synthesize plausibly prebiotic polymers this long by condensation in aqueous solution, because hydrolysis competes with polymerization. The potential of mineral surfaces to facilitate prebiotic polymerization was pointed out long ago. Here we describe a system that models prebiotic polymerization by the oligomerization of activated monomers--both nucleotides and amino acids. We find that whereas the reactions in solution produce only short oligomers (the longest typically being a 10-mer), the presence of mineral surfaces (montmorillonite for nucleotides, illite and hydroxylapatite for amino acids) induces the formation of oligomers up to 55 monomers long. These are formed by successive 'feedings' with the monomers; polymerization takes place on the mineral surfaces in a manner akin to solid-phase synthesis of biopolymers.
Groups of rhesus monkeys, heretofore described as closed social units, experience a seasonal exchange of a portion of the adult males. Male shifting corresponds with the season of mating, and results in copulation with females of newly joined groups. This pattern is socially disruptive, but provides opportunity for exchange of genetic material between groups of a region.
Heterochromatin is the highly compact, usually pericentromeric, region of eukaryotic chromosomes. Unlike the more gene-rich euchromatin, heterochromatin remains condensed during interphase, when it is sequestered to the periphery of the nucleus. Here we show, by using fluorescent in situ hybridization to interphase diploid nuclei of Drosophila, that the insertion of heterochromatin into a euchromatic gene, which results in position-effect variegation (PEV), also causes the aberrant association of the gene and its homologous copy with heterochromatin. In correlation with the gene's mutant variegating phenotype, the cytological association of the heterochromatic region is affected by chromosomal distance from heterochromatin and by genic modifiers of PEV. Proteins that are thought to be involved in the formation of heterochromatin can therefore influence the interphase nuclear position of a chromosomal region. This suggests that heterochromatin and proteins involved in its formation provide a structural framework for the interphase nucleus.
The Bacillus subtilis AT (anti-TRAP) protein inhibits the regulatory protein TRAP (trp RNA-binding attenuation protein), thereby eliminating transcription termination in the leader region of the trp operon. Transcription of the AT operon is activated by uncharged tryptophan transfer RNA (tRNATrp). Here we show that translation of AT also is regulated by uncharged tRNATrp. A 10-residue coding region containing three consecutive tryptophan codons is located immediately preceding the AT structural gene. Completion of translation of this coding region inhibits AT synthesis, whereas incomplete translation increases AT production. Tandem sensing of uncharged tRNATrp therefore regulates synthesis of AT, which in turn regulates TRAP's ability to inhibit trp operon expression.
Climate models with increased levels of carbon dioxide predict that global warming causes heating in the tropics, but investigations of ancient climates based on palaeodata have generally indicated cool tropical temperatures during supposed greenhouse episodes. For example, in the Late Cretaceous and Eocene epochs there is abundant geological evidence for warm, mostly ice-free poles, but tropical sea surface temperatures are generally estimated to be only 15-23 degrees C, based on oxygen isotope palaeothermometry of surface-dwelling planktonic foraminifer shells. Here we question the validity of most such data on the grounds of poor preservation and diagenetic alteration. We present new data from exceptionally well preserved foraminifer shells extracted from impermeable clay-rich sediments, which indicate that for the intervals studied, tropical sea surface temperatures were at least 28-32 degrees C. These warm temperatures are more in line with our understanding of the geographical distributions of temperature-sensitive fossil organisms and the results of climate models with increased CO2 levels.
Although cellular behaviors are dynamic, the networks that govern these behaviors have been mapped primarily as static snapshots. Using an approach called differential epistasis mapping, we have discovered widespread changes in genetic interaction among yeast kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors as the cell responds to DNA damage. Differential interactions uncover many gene functions that go undetected in static conditions. They are very effective at identifying DNA repair pathways, highlighting new damage-dependent roles for the Slt2 kinase, Pph3 phosphatase, and histone variant Htz1. The data also reveal that protein complexes are generally stable in response to perturbation, but the functional relations between these complexes are substantially reorganized. Differential networks chart a new type of genetic landscape that is invaluable for mapping cellular responses to stimuli.
Vision is critical for the functional and structural maturation of connections in the mammalian visual system. Visual experience, however, is a subset of a more general requirement for neural activity in transforming immature circuits into the organized connections that subserve adult brain function. Early in development, internally generated spontaneous activity sculpts circuits on the basis of the brain's "best guess" at the initial configuration of connections necessary for function and survival. With maturation of the sense organs, the developing brain relies less on spontaneous activity and increasingly on sensory experience. The sequential combination of spontaneously generated and experience-dependent neural activity endows the brain with an ongoing ability to accommodate to dynamically changing inputs during development and throughout life.
Understanding cellular response to environmental stress has broad implications for human disease. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) orchestrates the regulation of energy-generating and -consuming pathways, and protects the heart against ischaemic injury and apoptosis. A role for circulating hormones such as adiponectin and leptin in the activation of AMPK has received recent attention. Whether local autocrine and paracrine factors within target organs such as the heart modulate AMPK is unknown. Here we show that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), an upstream regulator of inflammation, is released in the ischaemic heart, where it stimulates AMPK activation through CD74, promotes glucose uptake and protects the heart during ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Germline deletion of the Mif gene impairs ischaemic AMPK signalling in the mouse heart. Human fibroblasts with a low-activity MIF promoter polymorphism have diminished MIF release and AMPK activation during hypoxia. Thus, MIF modulates the activation of the cardioprotective AMPK pathway during ischaemia, functionally linking inflammation and metabolism in the heart. We anticipate that genetic variation in MIF expression may impact on the response of the human heart to ischaemia by the AMPK pathway, and that diagnostic MIF genotyping might predict risk in patients with coronary artery disease.
The binding of benzo[a]pyrene to DNA in cultured human bronchus was measured in specimens from 37 patients. The binding values ranged from 2 to 151 picomoles of benzo[a]pyrene per milligram of DNA with an overall mean +/- standard error of 34.2 +/- 5.2. This 75-fold interindividual variation in the binding of benzo[a]pyrene to DNA is similar in magnitude to that found in pharmacogenetic studies of drug metabolism. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase is also inducible by benz[a]anthracene in the bronchial mucosa.
As a way of studying nucleosome assembly and maintenance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutants bearing deletions or duplications of the genes encoding histones H2A and H2B were analyzed. Previous genetic analysis had shown that only one of these mutants exhibited dramatic and pleiotropic phenotypes. This mutant was also the only one that contained disrupted chromatin, suggesting that the original phenotypes were attributable to alterations in chromosome structure. The chromatin disruption in the mutant, however, did not extend over the entire genome, but rather was localized to specific regions. Thus, while the arrangement of nucleosomes over the HIS4 and GAL1 genes, the telomeres, and the long terminal repeats (delta sequences) of Ty retrotransposons appeared essentially normal, nucleosomes over the CYH2 and UBI4 genes and the centromere of chromosome III were dramatically disrupted. The observation that the mutant exhibited localized chromatin disruptions implies that the assembly or maintenance of nucleosomes differs over different parts of the yeast genome.
In the developing nervous system, migrating cells and axons are guided to their targets by cues in the extracellular environment. The netrins are a family of phylogenetically conserved guidance cues that can function as diffusible attractants and repellents for different classes of cells and axons. In vertebrates, insects and nematodes, members of the DCC subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily have been implicated as receptors that are involved in migration towards netrin sources. The mechanisms that direct migration away from netrin sources (presumed repulsions) are less well understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the transmembrane protein UNC-5 (ref. 14) has been implicated in these responses, as loss of unc-5 function causes migration defects and ectopic expression of unc-5 in some neurons can redirect their axons away from a netrin source. Whether UNC-5 is a netrin receptor or simply an accessory to such a receptor has not, however, been defined. We now report the identification of two vertebrate homologues of UNC-5 which, with UNC-5 and the product of the mouse rostral cerebellar malformation gene (rcm), define a new subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and whose messenger RNAs show prominent expression in various classes of differentiating neurons. We provide evidence that these two UNC-5 homologues, as well as the rcm gene product, are netrin-binding proteins, supporting the hypothesis that UNC-5 and its relatives are netrin receptors.
We describe a new molecular class of genetic-pairing system that has a native DNA backbone but has all four base pairs replaced by new, larger pairs. The base pairs include size-expanded analogs of thymine and of adenine, both extended by the width of a benzene ring (2.4 A). The expanded-diameter double helices are more thermodynamically stable than the Watson-Crick helix, likely because of enhanced base stacking. Structural data confirm a right-handed, double-stranded, and base-paired helical form. Because of the larger base size, all the pairs of this helical system are fluorescent, which suggests practical applications in detection of natural DNA and RNA. Our findings establish that there is no apparent structural or thermodynamic prohibition against genetic systems having sizes different from the natural one.
Reduced serotonin transporter (5-HTT) expression is associated with abnormal affective and anxiety-like symptoms in humans and rodents, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Transient inhibition of 5-HTT during early development with fluoxetine, a commonly used serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor, produced abnormal emotional behaviors in adult mice. This effect mimicked the behavioral phenotype of mice genetically deficient in 5-HTT expression. These findings indicate a critical role of serotonin in the maturation of brain systems that modulate emotional function in the adult and suggest a developmental mechanism to explain how low-expressing 5-HTT promoter alleles increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.
We used a twin study to investigate the genetic and environmental contributions to differences in musical pitch perception abilities in humans. We administered a Distorted Tunes Test (DTT), which requires subjects to judge whether simple popular melodies contain notes with incorrect pitch, to 136 monozygotic twin pairs and 148 dizygotic twin pairs. The correlation of DTT scores between twins was estimated at 0.67 for monozygotic pairs and 0.44 for dizygotic pairs. Genetic model-fitting techniques supported an additive genetic model, with heritability estimated at 0.71 to 0.80, depending on how subjects were categorized, and with no effect of shared environment. DTT scores were only weakly correlated with measures of peripheral hearing. This suggests that variation in musical pitch recognition is primarily due to highly heritable differences in auditory functions not tested by conventional audiologic methods.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most prevalent dominantly inherited genetic diseases of the nervous system. NF1 encodes a tumor suppressor whose functional loss results in the development of benign neurofibromas that can progress to malignancy. Neurofibromas are complex tumors composed of axonal processes, Schwann cells, fibroblasts, perineurial cells, and mast cells. Through use of a conditional (cre/lox) allele, we show that loss of NF1 in the Schwann cell lineage is sufficient to generate tumors. In addition, complete NF1-mediated tumorigenicity requires both a loss of NF1 in cells destined to become neoplastic as well as heterozygosity in non-neoplastic cells. The requirement for a permissive haploinsufficient environment to allow tumorigenesis may have therapeutic implications for NF1 and other familial cancers.
Thymocyte antigens CD1 [Thy,gp45,12] are thought to be the human counterparts of mouse thymus leukaemia (TL) antigens. Serological and biochemical analyses indicate that at least three subsets exist, the first of which (HTA 1/T6) was initially identified by the monoclonal antibody NA1/34. Like TL, CD1 are expressed on cortical thymocytes as well as on some lymphoid neoplasias, and resemble in structure major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens. However HTA 1/T6 is loosely associated with beta 2-microglobulin and is also found linked by a disulphide bridge to CD8(T8). A molecular genetic approach is needed to investigate the CD1 system, to clarify its relationship to TL antigens and to understand its regulation. We report the isolation of complementary DNA (cDNA) clones encoding a CD1 antigen. These clones reveal a novel family of genes which are MHC-related but are neither equivalent to mouse TL antigens nor linked to the MHC.
The naturally occurring t-haplotypes of the mouse exhibit a set of peculiar genetic properties, including strong suppression of crossing over in the segment of chromosome 17 between the loci of T and H--2. Study of the genetics of mutant haplotypes suggests that the observed effects on meiosis and embryonic development may be due to an altered form of intercalary DNA (iDNA) in the relevant chromosomal region (band 17B).
Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic disease affecting caucasians and is perhaps best characterized as an exocrinopathy involving a disturbance in fluid and electrolyte transport. A high NaCl concentration in the sweat is characteristic of patients with this disease; the basic physiological reason for this abnormality is unknown. We have microperfused isolated sweat ducts from control subjects and cystic fibrosis patients, and report here results which suggest that abnormally low Cl- permeability in cystic fibrosis leads to poor reabsorption of NaCl in the sweat duct, and hence to a high concentration of NaCl in the sweat.
Transposons are mobile DNA segments that can disrupt gene function by inserting in or near genes. Here, we show that insertional mutagenesis by the PiggyBac transposon can be used for cancer gene discovery in mice. PiggyBac transposition in genetically engineered transposon-transposase mice induced cancers whose type (hematopoietic versus solid) and latency were dependent on the regulatory elements introduced into transposons. Analysis of 63 hematopoietic tumors revealed that PiggyBac is capable of genome-wide mutagenesis. The PiggyBac screen uncovered many cancer genes not identified in previous retroviral or Sleeping Beauty transposon screens, including Spic, which encodes a PU.1-related transcription factor, and Hdac7, a histone deacetylase gene. PiggyBac and Sleeping Beauty have different integration preferences. To maximize the utility of the tool, we engineered 21 mouse lines to be compatible with both transposon systems in constitutive, tissue- or temporal-specific mutagenesis. Mice with different transposon types, copy numbers, and chromosomal locations support wide applicability.
Most cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 proteins, both of which undergo regulated endoproteolytic processing. During apoptosis, PS1 and PS2 were shown to be cleaved at sites distal to their normal cleavage sites by a caspase-3 family protease. In cells expressing PS2 containing the asparagine-141 FAD mutant, the ratio of alternative to normal PS2 cleavage fragments was increased relative to wild-type PS2-expressing cells, suggesting a potential role for apoptosis-associated cleavage of presenilins in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
This is not the place to consider the medical significance of obesity in terms of conditions such as heart disease and hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis. These very complex interrelationships have been dealt with elsewhere (69). We hope that enough evidence has been presented to demonstrate that energy balance is normally maintained by a precise and reliable physiologic mechanism, and that the energy surplus represented by obesity may reflect direct failure of this mechanism or some combination from a variety of neurological, endocrine, enzymatic, and psychological disorders. Environmental conditions as well as genetic and traumatic factors may contribute to the development of obesity. If increasing mechanization brings tus below the level of energy expenditure at which food intake is properly regulated, appropriate habits of exercise will have to be established and maintained.
Rates and mechanisms of intron gain and loss have traditionally been inferred from alignments of highly conserved genes sampled from phylogenetically distant taxa. We report a population-genomic approach that detected 24 discordant intron/exon boundaries between the whole-genome sequences of two Daphnia pulex isolates. Sequencing of presence/absence loci across a collection of D. pulex isolates and outgroup Daphnia species shows that most polymorphisms are a consequence of recent gains, with parallel gains often occurring at the same locations in independent allelic lineages. More than half of the recent gains are associated with short sequence repeats, suggesting an origin via repair of staggered double-strand breaks. By comparing the allele-frequency spectrum of intron-gain alleles with that for derived single-base substitutions, we also provide evidence that newly arisen introns are intrinsically deleterious and tend to accumulate in population-genetic settings where random genetic drift is a relatively strong force.
Fusion of fresh lymphocytes from a Bloom syndrome (BS)  patient with those of normal subjects or a BS heterozygote resulted in complete normalization of the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in the chromosomes of BS cells. This normalization took place by the first mitosis in hybrid cells. In contrast, cultivation of BS lymphocytes with those of normal subjects or the BS heterozygote had no effect on sister chromatid exchanges. The cell fusion experiments suggest that the normalization on the sister chromatid exchanges. The cell fusion experiments suggest that the normalization of the sister chromatid exchange frequencies in BS cells can be achieved by factors conserved in the cells of various mammalian species. These findings are compatible with the concept that BS is a recessive genetic mutation at regulatory levels of the DNA repair function.
Evaluation by means of citation patterns can be successful only insofar as published papers and their bibliographies reflect scientific activity and nothing else. Such an innocent descrip tion is becoming less and less tenable. The present scientific explosion gave rise to more than a proportional pub lication explosion, which not only re flects the scientific explosion but has its own dynamics and vicious circles. Publication of results is probably the main means of accomplishing the al most impossible task of accounting for time and money spent on research. Inevitably, this puts a premium on quantity at the expense of quality, and, as with any other type of inflation, the problem worsens: the more papers are written, the less they count for and the greater is the pressure to publish more. What makes matters worse is the fact that the sheer volume of the"litera ture" makes it increasingly difficult to separate what is worthwhile from the rest. Critical reviews have become somewhat of a rarity, and editorial judgment is usually relegated to ref erees, who are contemporaries and, per haps, competitors of the authors-a situation which has its own undesirable implications (11, 18). It requires little imagination to discover other vicious circles, all arising from distortion of the primary reasons for publishing the results of scientific inquiry. There are, it is true, signs of ad justment to this crisis, partly due to some easing of the pressure to pub lish at all costs, and partly due to the readers' changing attitudes toward the flood of publications. An increasing amount of research is now being car ried out in the form of collective proj ects in large institutions where publica tion is no longer the standard method of accounting for individual work. At the same time there is apparent an in creasing tendency for scientific journals to polarize into the relatively few leading ones which carry important informa tion and the many subsidiary journals which serve as vehicles for interim lo cal accounting and, in a way, sub stitute for detailed intradepartmental re ports. This division is a result not of some arbitrary decree but of normal competition between journals, as a re sult of which, however, the strong usual ly get stronger and the weak get weaker. Were it not for these changes and also for a striking improvement in abstracting, indexing, and alerting serv ices, most research workers would have found long ago that, even in their own specialized fields, new information is accumulating faster than it can be sorted out. These developments can pro vide only a temporary reprieve, so long as there remains a strong incentive to publish the greatest possible number of papers. A new scale of values based on citations is by no means infallible or, in many cases, even fair, but at least it provides an alternative to the existing one, which is at the root of the crisis. It might, of course, be asked whether wide acceptance of such new stand ards would not lead to deliberate abuses. A little reflection shows that the system is less open to manipula tion than might appear. First, the ref erees are expected to see to it that the submitted papers cite work which is pertinent to the subject. An increased awareness of the usefulness of citation indexing as a tool for retrieval and evaluation will make this aspect of refereeing more important, and what now passes for minor carelessness or discourtesy could easily come to be regarded as serious malpractice. Sec ond, as noted above, careful selection of references is in the author's own interest, because it helps him to reach his readers. There is, therefore, some room for hope that healthy feedback in the system will tend to keep it viable. At the basis of this hope lies the supposition that, in the long run, only good work can ensure recognition. As Martyn (2) has pointed out, as an information-retrieval method, cita tion indexing is rather "noisy." The word noisy may apply even more to the problem of evaluation. Whereas in information retrieval much of the unwanted information can be filtered out by suitable search strategy (2, 6), this is not so easy to do for the pur pose of evaluation, because a simple descendence relationship between papers is still an ideal far removed from actuality (7). The situation would be much better if we could at will exclude all citations which do not indi cate real indebtedness. A scheme of citation relationship indicators, first men tioned by Garfield (12) and elaborated by Lipetz (17), would be a help, but, even if it were technically feasible, to provide such indicators would greatly add to the production costs of the Index. Another possible way to minimize the effects of "noise" is to increase the size of the samples on which the reckon ing is based. Now that research has be come a rather popular occupation, it seems that a kind of public vote may have to be accepted as a factor in evaluation. Since this is the case, there is something to be said for extending the "franchise" to minimize acciden tal effects. An index which attempted to process all scientific publications would be several times the size of the present Index, and, what is more, it would not necessarily be an improve ment as a tool for information retrieval because most of the significant work is already concentrated in the present Index. Whether this attempt will ever be considered worthwhile remains pri marily a matter of policy and eco nomics. In the meantime there is an urgent need for more experience with the existing services. It is not the purpose of this article to advocate evaluation of scientific work by some kind of public opinion poll; its purpose is to recognize a pos sible trend in this direction. Any judg ment by public acclaim is subject to obvious fallacies, but we must not be carried away by the analogy to the Stock Exchange or to electoral prac tices. The fact that, in this case, the "public" consists of authors whose con tributions are generally linked creates quite a new pattern of organization. In this discussion some of the aspects of this pattern have been explored through analogy to idealized genetic or mechani cal network models, but the very uniqueness of the system, with its many self-organizing ramifications, makes it a new field which deserves close study, since these developments may have pro found effects on the future of scientific communication.
Factor IX is the precursor of a serine protease that functions in the intrinsic blood clotting pathway. Deficiencies in this plasma glycoprotein result in haemophilia B (or Christmas disease) and occur in about 1 in 30,000 males. Patients are currently treated with fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrates prepared from pooled plasma from normal individuals. There are several problems with this method of treatment, including the probable exposure of the patients to contaminants such as the viral agents responsible for hepatitis and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). As a first step towards an alternative source of pure human factor IX, we report here on the use of recombinant DNA techniques to produce biologically active factor IX in cultured mammalian cells. Stable cell lines were produced by cotransfecting a baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell line with a plasmid containing a gene for factor IX and a plasmid containing a selectable marker. Protein secreted by these cell lines reduces the clotting time of plasma from factor IX-deficient patients. We present additional evidence that this protein is authentic human factor IX.
Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) were obtained from a 550-kilobase region that contains three probes previously mapped as very close to the locus of the fragile X syndrome. These YACs spanned the fragile site in Xq27.3 as shown by fluorescent in situ hybridization. An internal 200-kilobase segment contained four chromosomal breakpoints generated by induction of fragile X expression. A single CpG island was identified in the cloned region between markers DXS463 and DXS465 that appears methylated in mentally retarded fragile X males, but not in nonexpressing male carriers of the mutation nor in normal males. This CpG island may indicate the presence of a gene involved in the clinical phenotype of the syndrome.
The fossil record of anthropoid primates from the Middle Eocene of South Asia is so far restricted to two genera (Pondaungia cotteri Pilgrim, 1937 and Amphipithecus mogaungensis Colbert, 1937 from the Eocene Pondaung deposits of Burma) whose anthropoid status and phylogenetic position have long been under debate because they represent the oldest highly derived fossil primates of anthropoid grade. Moreover, several new African taxa, some of which are even older, have been recently included in the suborder Anthropoidea, suggesting an African origin for this group. Conversely, new fossil primates recently discovered in China (Eosimias) have been related to the most primitive representatives of Anthropoidea, alternatively suggesting an Asian origin and a probable Asian radiation centre. We report here the discovery of a new anthropoid from the Thai Late Eocene locality of Krabi, which displays several additional anthropoid characters with regard to those of the Eocene Burmese genera. This species, which is about the size of the Fayum Aegyptopithecus, can be related to the Burmese forms, and it further provides strong additional evidence for a southeast Asian evolutionary centre for anthropoids.
Bacteriophages, herpesviruses, and other large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses contain molecular machines that pump DNA into preassembled procapsids, generating internal capsid pressures exceeding, by 10-fold, that of bottled champagne. A 17 angstrom resolution asymmetric reconstruction of the infectious P22 virion reveals that tightly spooled DNA about the portal dodecamer forces a conformation that is significantly different from that observed in isolated portals assembled from ectopically expressed protein. We propose that the tight dsDNA spooling activates the switch that signals the headful chromosome packing density to the particle exterior.
With some ingenuity, a transformation of our attitudes toward preservation of the environment will take place fairly soon. We will recognize the symbolic and social meanings of environments, not just their economic utility; we will emphasize their historical significance as well as the future generations that will use them. At the same time, we must realize that there are things we may not want to trade at all, except in the sense of letting someone else have his share of the environment also. As environments become more differentiated, smaller areas will probably be given greater significance, and it may be possible for more groups to have a share. It is likely that we shall want to apply our technology to the creation of artificial environments. It may be possible to create environments that are evocative of other environments in other times and places. It is possible that, by manipulating memory through the rewriting of history, environments will come to have new meaning. Finally, we may want to create proxy environments by means of substitution and simulation. In order to create substitutes, we must endow new objects with significance by means of advertising and by social practice. Sophistication about differentiation will become very important for appreciating the substitute environments. We may simulate the environment by means of photographs, recordings, models, and perhaps even manipulations in the brain (48). What we experience in natural environments may actually be more controllable than we imagine (49). Artificial prairies and wildernesses have been created, and there is no reason to believe that these artificial environments need be unsatisfactory for those who experience them. Rare environments are relative, can be created, are dependent on our knowledge, and are a function of policy, not only tradition. It seems likely that economic arguments will not be sufficient to preserve environments or to suggest how we can create new ones. Rather, conscious choice about what matters, and then a financial and social investment in an effort to create significant experiences and environments, will become a policy alternative available to us. What's wrong with plastic trees? My guess is that there is very little wrong with them. Much more can be done with plastic trees and the like (50) to give most people the feeling that they are experiencing nature. We will have to realize that the way in which we experience nature is conditioned by our society-which more and more is seen to be receptive to responsible interventions. Bentham, the father of utilitarianism, was very concerned about the uses of the dead to the living and suggested (51): If a country gentleman have rows of trees leading to his dwelling, the autoicons [embalmed bodies in an upright position] of his family might alternate with the trees; copal varnish would protect the face from the effects of rain-caoutchouc [rubber] the habiliments.
Here we present a draft genome sequence of the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Through comparison with the human genome, we have generated a largely complete catalogue of the genetic differences that have accumulated since the human and chimpanzee species diverged from our common ancestor, constituting approximately thirty-five million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal rearrangements. We use this catalogue to explore the magnitude and regional variation of mutational forces shaping these two genomes, and the strength of positive and negative selection acting on their genes. In particular, we find that the patterns of evolution in human and chimpanzee protein-coding genes are highly correlated and dominated by the fixation of neutral and slightly deleterious alleles. We also use the chimpanzee genome as an outgroup to investigate human population genetics and identify signatures of selective sweeps in recent human evolution.
In eight highly inducible strains of Staphylococcus aureus repression of the formation of penicillinase was temperature-sensitive under conditions suggesting direct thermal inactivation of the repressor. Restoration of repression required protein synthesis. These strains were resistant to benzylpenicillin and to many other antibiotics. One auxotrophic mutant had gredtly reduced temperature sensitivity but was still normally inducible. Six strains were relatively poorly inducible, exhibited a proportionately smaller increase in enzyme after exposure to elevated temperature, and were sensitive to antibiotics other than benzylpenicillin. Temperature sensitivity may be a useful character in studies of the physiology and genetics of the repression of staphylococcal penicillinase.
Auxin is a plant hormone that regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. We used a chemical genetics approach to identify SIR1, a regulator of many auxin-inducible genes. The sir1 mutant was resistant to sirtinol, a small molecule that activates many auxin-inducible genes and promotes auxin-related developmental phenotypes. SIR1 is predicted to encode a protein composed of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like domain and a Rhodanese-like domain homologous to that of prolyl isomerase. We suggest a molecular context for how the auxin signal is propagated to exert its biological effects.
A defect in regulation of a chloride channel appears to be the molecular basis for cystic fibrosis (CF), a common lethal genetic disease. It is shown here that a chloride channel with kinetic and regulatory properties similar to those described for secretory epithelial cells is present in both T and B lymphocyte cell lines. The regulation of the channels by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase in transformed B cells from CF patients is defective. Thus, lymphocytes may be an accessible source of CF tissue for study of this defect, for cloning of the chloride channel complex, and for diagnosis of the disease.
The mutagenic and recombinogenic activities of furylfuramide, an antimicrobial food additive, were tested in a two-component heterokaryon of Neurospora crassa and a diploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. The results show that furylfuramide is genetically active in both eukaryotic organisms; it induces mutations in Neurospora crassa and mitotic crossing over in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Blood revenge is one of the most commonly cited causes of violence and warfare in tribal societies, yet it is largely ignored in recent anthropological theories of primitive warfare. A theory of tribal violence is presented showing how homicide, revenge, kinship obligations, and warfare are linked and why reproductive variables must be included in explanations of tribal violence and warfare. Studies of the Yanomamo Indians of Amazonas during the past 23 years show that 44 percent of males estimated to be 25 or older have participated in the killing of someone, that approximately 30 percent of adult male dealths are due to violence, and that nearly 70 percent of all adults over an estimated 40 years of age have lost a close genetic relative due to violence. Demographic data indicate that men who have killed have more wives and offspring than men who have not killed.
Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules function as antigen-presenting elements as well as signal transducers on B lymphocytes. We previously reported that a B lymphoma cell transfectant, 5C2, expressing genetically engineered I-Ak molecules with truncated cytoplasmic domains was severely impaired in both antigen presentation and in anti-Ia-induced intracytoplasmic signalling. These two functions could be restored by preculturing 5C2 cells with cyclic AMP analogues. Here we demonstrate that impaired signal transduction by truncated class II molecules results in a deficiency in induction of the newly defined B-cell accessory molecule B7 (ref. 8), which can be reversed by restoration of B7 expression. These data imply that contact of the T-cell antigen receptor with MHC/antigen ligand results in signal transmission through the class II cytoplasmic domain. This signal, which can be mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP, induces expression of B7, resulting in effective antigen presentation. The fact that crosslinking of surface class II MHC also induces B7 expression on normal resting human B cells supports this contention.
Some normal-looking chloroplasts of a Nitella cell do not incorporate carbon dioxide into substances insoluble in cold acid. The distribution of such chloroplasts among the rows of normal organelles indicates that the defect is not due to a genetic mutation but probably represents a physiological stage in the development of the organelles.
Polyinosinic.polycytidylic acid [poly(I.C)] induced production of interferon by a strain of diploid human fibroblasts (FS-4), measured between 5 and 24 hours from induction, is enhanced up to 128-fold by 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), a reversible inhibitor of nuclear heterogeneous RNA synthesis. A normalized dose-effect plot shows a close correlation between the superinducing effect of DRB and inhibition of RNA synthesis. Cultures that contained DRB continue to produce interferon for up to 4 days. Removal of the drug at any time during this period leads to a prompt shutoff of interferon production.
The crystal structure of the bacterial 70S ribosome refined to 2.8 angstrom resolution reveals atomic details of its interactions with messenger RNA (mRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). A metal ion stabilizes a kink in the mRNA that demarcates the boundary between A and P sites, which is potentially important to prevent slippage of mRNA. Metal ions also stabilize the intersubunit interface. The interactions of E-site tRNA with the 50S subunit have both similarities and differences compared to those in the archaeal ribosome. The structure also rationalizes much biochemical and genetic data on translation.
Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties. Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species.
Cryptochrome (CRY), a photoreceptor for the circadian clock in Drosophila, binds to the clock component TIM in a light-dependent fashion and blocks its function. In mammals, genetic evidence suggests a role for CRYs within the clock, distinct from hypothetical photoreceptor functions. Mammalian CRY1 and CRY2 are here shown to act as light-independent inhibitors of CLOCK-BMAL1, the activator driving Per1 transcription. CRY1 or CRY2 (or both) showed light-independent interactions with CLOCK and BMAL1, as well as with PER1, PER2, and TIM. Thus, mammalian CRYs act as light-independent components of the circadian clock and probably regulate Per1 transcriptional cycling by contacting both the activator and its feedback inhibitors.
The Siberian Traps represent one of the most voluminous flood basalt provinces on Earth. Laser-heating (40)Ar/(39)Ar data indicate that the bulk of these basalts was erupted over an extremely short time interval (900,000 +/- 800,000 years) beginning at about 248 million years ago at mean eruption rates of greater than 1.3 cubic kilometers per year. Such rates are consistent with a mantle plume origin. Magmatism was not associated with significant lithospheric rifting; thus, mantle decompression resulting from rifting was probably not the primary cause of widespread melting. Inception of Siberian Traps volcanism coincided (within uncertainty) with a profound faunal mass extinction at the Permo-Triassic boundary 249 +/- 4 million years ago; these data thus leave open the question of a genetic relation between the two events.
Genetically normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats nursed by spontaneously hypertensive foster mothers develop sustained high blood pressure. Some factor related to the genetically programmed hypertension of the foster mother is probably transmitted to the infant rats through her milk. Alternatively, the hyperkinetic behavior of the mother may activate a hypertensinogen in young having the proper constellation of genes.
Pertussis toxin (PTX) is a major virulence factor in whooping cough and can elicit protective antibodies. Amino acid residues 8 to 15 of PTX subunit S1 are important for the adenosine diphosphate-ribosyltransferase activity associated with the pathobiological effects of PTX. Furthermore, this region contains at least a portion of an epitope that elicits both toxin-neutralizing and protective antibody responses in mice. The gene encoding the S1 subunit was subjected to site-specific mutagenesis in this critical region. A mutant containing a single amino acid substitution (Arg9----Lys) had reduced enzymatic activity (approximately 0.02% of control) while retaining the protective epitope. This analog S1 molecule may provide the basis for a genetically detoxified PTX with potential for use as a component of an acellular vaccine against whooping cough.
The study of human hematopoietic cells and the human immune system is hampered by the lack of a suitable experimental model. Experimental data are presented showing that human fetal liver hematopoietic cells, human fetal thymus, and human fetal lymph node support the differentiation of mature human T cells and B cells after engraftment into mice with genetically determined severe combined immunodeficiency. The resultant SCID-hu mice are found to have a transient wave of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and human IgG (immunoglobulin G) in the peripheral circulation. The functional status of the human immune system within this mouse model is not yet known.
A physical map of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 4 was constructed in yeast artificial chromosome clones and used to analyze the organization of the chromosome. Mapping of the nucleolar organizing region and the centromere integrated the physical and cytogenetic maps. Detailed comparison of physical with genetic distances showed that the frequency of recombination varied substantially, with relative hot and cold spots occurring along the whole chromosome. Eight repeated DNA sequence families were found in a complex arrangement across the centromeric region and nowhere else on the chromosome.
The observation that one hemisphere of Mars is lower and has a thinner crust than the other (the 'martian hemispheric dichotomy') has been a puzzle for 30 years. The dichotomy may have arisen as a result of internal mechanisms such as convection. Alternatively, it may have been caused by one or several giant impacts, but quantitative tests of the impact hypothesis have not been published. Here we use a high-resolution, two-dimensional, axially symmetric hydrocode to model vertical impacts over a range of parameters appropriate to early Mars. We propose that the impact model, in addition to excavating a crustal cavity of the correct size, explains two other observations. First, crustal disruption at the impact antipode is probably responsible for the observed antipodal decline in magnetic field strength. Second, the impact-generated melt forming the northern lowlands crust is predicted to derive from a deep, depleted mantle source. This prediction is consistent with characteristics of martian shergottite meteorites and suggests a dichotomy formation time approximately 100 Myr after martian accretion, comparable to that of the Moon-forming impact on Earth.
Because of its simplicity, the binary-switch nature of left-right asymmetry permits meaningful comparisons among many different organisms. Phylogenetic analyses of asymmetry variation, inheritance, and molecular mechanisms reveal unexpected insights into how development evolves. First, directional asymmetry, an evolutionary novelty, arose from nonheritable origins almost as often as from mutations, implying that genetic assimilation ("phenotype precedes genotype") is a common mode of evolution. Second, the molecular pathway directing hearts leftward-the nodal cascade-varies considerably among vertebrates (homology of form does not require homology of development) and was possibly co-opted from a preexisting asymmetrical chordate organ system. Finally, declining frequencies of spontaneous asymmetry reversal throughout vertebrate evolution suggest that heart development has become more canalized.
Messenger RNA synthesis by the DNA tumour viruses proceeds by a complex but versatile series of transcription and RNA processing steps. The major mechanistic features of this pathway are probably very similar to those used by the animal cell host itself. The viruses have, however, evolved intricate arrangements of protein coding sequences and sites for RNA initiation, polyadenylation and splicing which allow them to use their genetic information to maximum advantage.
Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) into enucleated oocytes has emerged as a technique that can be used to derive mouse embryonic stem cell lines with defined genotypes. In this issue Byrne et al. report the derivation of two SCNT Rhesus macaca male stem cell lines designated CRES-1 and CRES-2. Molecular studies detailed in their paper provides supporting evidence that the chromosome complement of CRES-1 and CRES-2 was genetically identical to the male cell donor nucleus and that the mitochondrial DNA originated from different recipient oocytes. In this validation paper, we independently confirm that both stem cell lines were indeed derived by SCNT.
In many developmental contexts, a locally produced morphogen specifies positional information by forming a concentration gradient over a field of cells. However, during embryonic dorsal-ventral patterning in Drosophila, two members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Screw (Scw), are broadly transcribed but promote receptor-mediated signalling in a restricted subset of expressing cells. Here we use a novel immunostaining protocol to visualize receptor-bound BMPs and show that both proteins become localized to a sharp stripe of dorsal cells. We demonstrate that proper BMP localization involves two distinct processes. First, Dpp undergoes directed, long-range extracellular transport. Scw also undergoes long-range movement, but can do so independently of Dpp transport. Second, an intracellular positive feedback circuit promotes future ligand binding as a function of previous signalling strength. These data elicit a model in which extracellular Dpp transport initially creates a shallow gradient of BMP binding that is acted on by positive intracellular feedback to produce two stable states of BMP-receptor interactions, a spatial bistability in which BMP binding and signalling capabilities are high in dorsal-most cells and low in lateral cells.
Muscles generate force and shortening in a cyclical interaction between the myosin head domains projecting from the myosin filaments and the adjacent actin filaments. Although many features of the dynamic performance of muscle are determined by the rates of attachment and detachment of myosin and actin, the primary event in force generation is thought to be a conformational change or 'working stroke' in the actin-bound myosin head. According to this hypothesis, the working stroke is much faster than attachment or detachment, but can be observed directly in the rapid force transients that follow step displacement of the filaments. Although many studies of the mechanism of muscle contraction have been based on this hypothesis, the alternative view-that the fast force transients are caused by fast components of attachment and detachment--has not been excluded definitively. Here we show that measurements of the axial motions of the myosin heads at angstrom resolution by a new X-ray interference technique rule out the rapid attachment/detachment hypothesis, and provide compelling support for the working stroke model of force generation.
A Candida albicans gene (CPH1) was cloned that encodes a protein homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste12p, a transcription factor that is the target of the pheromone response mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. CPH1 complements both the mating defect of ste12 haploids and the filamentous growth defect of ste12/ste12 diploids. Candida albicans strains without a functional CPH1 gene (cph1/cph1) show suppressed hyphal formation on solid medium. However, cph1/cph1 strains can still form hyphae in liquid culture and in response to serum. Thus, filamentous growth may be activated in C. albicans by the same signaling kinase cascade that activates Ste12p in S. cerevisiae; however, alternative pathways may exist in C. albicans.
A reversible block to RNA polymerase II transcriptional elongation has been created with a lac operator sequence in the intron of the SV40 large T-antigen gene. When this transcription unit is injected into rabbit kidney cells expressing Escherichia coli lac repressor, T-antigen expression is reduced. This effect is not observed in cells lacking repressor or in the absence of the operator, and it is reversed by an inducer of the lac operon, namely isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG). In an extract of HeLa nuclei supplemented with lac repressor, this and similar constructs give rise to shortened transcripts that map to the 5' boundary of the repressor-operator complex. These shorter RNAs are also sensitive to IPTG induction. This model system shows that a protein-DNA complex can block the passage of RNA polymerase II, and offers some insight into the control of eukaryotic gene expression during transcription elongation, a phenomenon observed in a variety of systems.
Deuterostomes comprise vertebrates, the related invertebrate chordates (tunicates and cephalochordates) and three other invertebrate taxa: hemichordates, echinoderms and Xenoturbella. The relationships between invertebrate and vertebrate deuterostomes are clearly important for understanding our own distant origins. Recent phylogenetic studies of chordate classes and a sea urchin have indicated that urochordates might be the closest invertebrate sister group of vertebrates, rather than cephalochordates, as traditionally believed. More remarkable is the suggestion that cephalochordates are closer to echinoderms than to vertebrates and urochordates, meaning that chordates are paraphyletic. To study the relationships among all deuterostome groups, we have assembled an alignment of more than 35,000 homologous amino acids, including new data from a hemichordate, starfish and Xenoturbella. We have also sequenced the mitochondrial genome of Xenoturbella. We support the clades Olfactores (urochordates and vertebrates) and Ambulacraria (hemichordates and echinoderms). Analyses using our new data, however, do not support a cephalochordate and echinoderm grouping and we conclude that chordates are monophyletic. Finally, nuclear and mitochondrial data place Xenoturbella as the sister group of the two ambulacrarian phyla. As such, Xenoturbella is shown to be an independent phylum, Xenoturbellida, bringing the number of living deuterostome phyla to four.
A concern voiced in connection with recent sequencing of cytochrome c from the Rhodospirillaceae or purple non-sulphur photosynthetic bacteria is that molecular information might be of little use in deciphering bacterial phylogeny because of the possibility of lateral transfer of genes and the consequent scrambling of the genetic record. This could be true for many proteins, of course, but the immediate question is, is it true for cytochroms available for comparison? The evidence suggests that this is probably not so. The disagreement between cytochrome c sequences and the standard taxonomy of the Rhodospirillaceae in Bergey's Manual is not a problem. That reference, as its title indicates, is a manual of determinative rather than evolutionary bacteriology. Its goal is a reproducible system for identification of bacteria. If one claims that these determinative categories also have phylogenetic or evolutionary meaning, this is an assertion that must be proven. The argument outlined below suggests that molecular traits may eventually become more a dependable basis for classification of the Rhodospirillaceae than is gross morphology.
Handicap models of sexual selection predict that male sexual ornaments have strong condition-dependent expression and this allows females to evaluate male genetic quality. A number of previous experiments have demonstrated heightened condition-dependence of sexual ornaments in response to environmental stress. Here we show that genetic variation underlies the response to environmental stress (variable food quality) of a sexual ornament (male eye span) in the stalk-eyed fly Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni. Some male genotypes develop large eye span under all conditions, whereas other genotypes progressively reduce eye span as conditions deteriorate. Several non-sexual traits (female eye span, male and female wing length) also show genetic variation in condition-dependent expression, but their genetic response is entirely explained by scaling with body size. In contrast, the male sexual ornament still reveals genetic variation in the response to environmental stress after accounting for differences in body size. These results strongly support the hypothesis that female mate choice yields genetic benefits for offspring.
An emerging set of methods enables an experimental dialogue with biological systems composed of many interacting cell types--in particular, with neural circuits in the brain. These methods are sometimes called "optogenetic" because they use light-responsive proteins ("opto-") encoded in DNA ("-genetic"). Optogenetic devices can be introduced into tissues or whole organisms by genetic manipulation and be expressed in anatomically or functionally defined groups of cells. Two kinds of devices perform complementary functions: Light-driven actuators control electrochemical signals, while light-emitting sensors report them. Actuators pose questions by delivering targeted perturbations; sensors (and other measurements) signal answers. These catechisms are beginning to yield previously unattainable insight into the organization of neural circuits, the regulation of their collective dynamics, and the causal relationships between cellular activity patterns and behavior.
Here it is shown, with the use of protein-protein photocrosslinking, that the carboxyl-terminal region of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP) is in direct physical proximity to the activating region of the catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) in the ternary complex of the lac promoter, RNAP, and CAP. These results strongly support the proposal that transcription activation by CAP involves protein-protein contact between the carboxyl-terminal region of the alpha subunit and the activating region of CAP.
The metameric pattern of the Drosophila embryo is regulated by a combination of maternal and zygotic genes. The segment-polarity class of genes are required for the correct patterning within each segmental unit. Mutations in any one of these genes results in deletions and duplications of parts of each segment. The segment-polarity genes act coordinately by means of local cellular interactions to assign and maintain an identity for each cell in the segment, and to establish segment boundaries. Here we describe the molecular characterization of a novel segment-polarity gene, zeste-white3 (zw3). Embryos derived from germ lines that are homozygous for zw3 mutations (zw3 embryos) have phenotypes similar to embryos that are mutant for the segment-polarity gene naked (nkd). These embryos lack most of the ventral denticles, which are differentiated structures derived from the most anterior region of each segment. We have isolated the zw3 gene and compared the structure of one maternal and one zygotic transcript encoded by the gene. The zw3 gene is unique among the segment-polarity genes so far characterized, in that it encodes proteins that have homology to serine-threonine protein kinases. This indicates that zw3 may play a part in a signal transduction pathway involved in the establishment of cell identity within each embryonic segment.
Two genetically distinct clones of the asexual triploid fish Poeciliopsis 2 monacha-lucida inhabit the Rio del Fuerte of northwestern Mexico. Their coexistence apparently depends on feeding specializations that result in partitioning of the limited food resources in the desert streams. The findings suggest that these asexual organisms have sufficient clonal diversity to occupy a broad, heterogeneous, adaptive zone.
Clonal populations regenerated from single-leaf cell protoplasts of the potato cultivar ;Russet Burbank' display a high frequency of variation for several horticultural and disease resistance characters. Observations over a period of three tuber generations suggest stable changes in tuber shape, yield, and maturity date, in photo-period requirements for flowering, and in plant morphology. Enhanced resistance to early blight (Alternaria solani) and late blight (Phytophthora infestans) diseases also regularly occurs within regenerated populations. These findings are discussed in the context of possible application to varietal improvement, particularly as they pertain to asexually propagated plants.
Monoamine oxidase activity in blood platelets was measured, with [(14)C]tryptamine as substrate, in 13 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia and in 23 normal volunteers. The monoamine oxidase activity of both schizophrenic and nonschizophrenic co-twins was significantly lower than it was for the normals, and it was highly correlated between twins. In addition, there was a significant inverse correlation between a measure of the degree of the schizophrenic disorder and the monoamine oxidase activity. These data suggest, but do not prove, that reduced platelet monoamine oxidase activity may provide a genetic marker for vulnerability to schizophrenia.
A complementary DNA (cDNA) for the rat luteal lutropin-choriogonadotropin receptor (LH-CG-R) was isolated with the use of a DNA probe generated in a polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers based on peptide sequences of purified receptor protein. As would be predicted from the cDNA sequence, the LH-CG-R consists of a 26-residue signal peptide, a 341-residue extracellular domain displaying an internal repeat structure characteristic of members of the leucine-rich glycoprotein (LRG) family, and a 333-residue region containing seven transmembrane segments. This membrane-spanning region displays sequence similarity with all members of the G protein-coupled receptor family. Hence, the LH-CG-R gene may have evolved by recombination of LRG and G protein-coupled receptor genes. Cells engineered to express LH-CG-R cDNA bind human choriogonadotropin with high affinity and show an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate when exposed to hormone. As revealed by RNA blot analysis and in situ hybridization, the 4.4-kilobase cognate messenger RNA is prominently localized in the rat ovary.
Modular polyketide synthases are giant multifunctional enzymes that catalyse the condensation of small carboxylic acids such as acetate and propionate into structurally diverse polyketides that possess a spectrum of biological activities. In a modular polyketide synthase, an enzymatic domain catalyses a specific reaction, and three to six enzymatic domains involved in a condensation-processing cycle are organized into a module. A fundamental aspect of a modular polyketide synthase is that its module arrangement linearly specifies the structure of its polyketide product. Here we report a natural example in which alternative expression of the pikromycin polyketide synthase results in the generation of two macrolactone structures. Expression of the full-length modular polyketide synthase PikAIV in Streptomyces venezuelae generates the 14-membered ring macrolactone narbonolide, whereas expression of the amino-terminal truncated form of PikAIV leads to 'skipping' of the final condensation cycle in polyketide biosynthesis to generate the 12-membered ring macrolactone 10-deoxymethynolide. Our findings provide insight into the structure and function of modular polyketide synthases, as well as a new set of tools to generate structural diversity in polyketide natural products.
Cytosine methylation has been implicated in epigenetic control of gene expression in animals, plants, and fungi. It has been assumed that all methylation in eukaryotes is at symmetrical sequences such as CpG/GpC, because this can explain perpetuation of methylation states. Here the bisulfite genomic sequencing method was used to examine methylation in DNA from a Neurospora gene exposed to repeat-induced point mutation. 5-Methylcytosine was not limited to symmetrical sites and individual molecules showed different patterns and amounts of modification. The methylation extended beyond the mutated region and even beyond the edge of the duplicated segment.
According to the current model of adult epidermal homeostasis, skin tissue is maintained by two discrete populations of progenitor cells: self-renewing stem cells; and their progeny, known as transit amplifying cells, which differentiate after several rounds of cell division. By making use of inducible genetic labelling, we have tracked the fate of a representative sample of progenitor cells in mouse tail epidermis at single-cell resolution in vivo at time intervals up to one year. Here we show that clone-size distributions are consistent with a new model of homeostasis involving only one type of progenitor cell. These cells are found to undergo both symmetric and asymmetric division at rates that ensure epidermal homeostasis. The results raise important questions about the potential role of stem cells on tissue maintenance in vivo.
Adaptation is a central focus of biology, although it can be difficult to identify both the strength and agent of selection and the underlying molecular mechanisms causing change. We studied cryptically colored deer mice living on the Nebraska Sand Hills and show that their light coloration stems from a novel banding pattern on individual hairs produced by an increase in Agouti expression caused by a cis-acting mutation (or mutations), which either is or is closely linked to a single amino acid deletion in Agouti that appears to be under selection. Furthermore, our data suggest that this derived Agouti allele arose de novo after the formation of the Sand Hills. These findings reveal one means by which genetic, developmental, and evolutionary mechanisms can drive rapid adaptation under ecological pressure.
At a recent workshop, experts discussed the benefits, risks, and research priorities associated with using genetically manipulated insects in the control of vector-borne diseases.
The interactions between plants and their animal pollinators and seed dispersers have moulded much of Earth's biodiversity. Recently, it has been shown that these mutually beneficial interactions form complex networks with a well-defined architecture that may contribute to biodiversity persistence. Little is known, however, about which ecological and evolutionary processes generate these network patterns. Here we use phylogenetic methods to show that the phylogenetic relationships of species predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. As a consequence of the phylogenetic effects on interaction patterns, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree and a more pronounced loss of taxonomic diversity than expected in the absence of a phylogenetic signal. Our results emphasize how the simultaneous consideration of phylogenetic information and network architecture can contribute to our understanding of the structure and fate of species-rich communities.
An optical/infrared telescope of 20-100 m aperture located on the Moon would be able to observe objects 100 to 1,000 times fainter than the proposed next generation of space telescopes. The infrared region of the spectrum is particularly important for observations of objects at redshifts z > 7. The apparent simplicity and low mass of a liquid mirror telescope, compared with a traditional pointable glass mirror, suggest that the concept should be considered further. A previously proposed liquid mirror telescope, based upon a spinning liquid metallic alloy, is not appropriate for infrared applications, which will require a liquid below 130 K. Here we report the successful coating of an ionic liquid with silver. The surface is smooth and the silver coating is stable on a timescale of months. The underlying ionic liquid does not evaporate in a vacuum and remains liquid down to a temperature of 175 K. Given that there are approximately 10(6) simple and approximately 10(18) ternary ionic liquids, it should be possible to synthesize liquids with even lower melting temperatures.
Genome sequencing is leading to the discovery of new genes at a rate 50-100 times greater than that achieved by classical genetics, but the biological function of almost half of these genes is completely unknown. In order fully to exploit genome sequence data, a systematic approach to the discovery of gene function is required. Possible strategies are discussed here in the context of functional analysis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model eukaryote whose genome sequence will soon be completed.
Emergent quantum technologies have led to increasing interest in decoherence--the processes that limit the appearance of quantum effects and turn them into classical phenomena. One important cause of decoherence is the interaction of a quantum system with its environment, which 'entangles' the two and distributes the quantum coherence over so many degrees of freedom as to render it unobservable. Decoherence theory has been complemented by experiments using matter waves coupled to external photons or molecules, and by investigations using coherent photon states, trapped ions and electron interferometers. Large molecules are particularly suitable for the investigation of the quantum-classical transition because they can store much energy in numerous internal degrees of freedom; the internal energy can be converted into thermal radiation and thus induce decoherence. Here we report matter wave interferometer experiments in which C70 molecules lose their quantum behaviour by thermal emission of radiation. We find good quantitative agreement between our experimental observations and microscopic decoherence theory. Decoherence by emission of thermal radiation is a general mechanism that should be relevant to all macroscopic bodies.
The sense of taste provides animals with valuable information about the nature and quality of food. Bitter taste detection functions as an important sensory input to warn against the ingestion of toxic and noxious substances. T2Rs are a family of approximately 30 highly divergent G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are selectively expressed in the tongue and palate epithelium and are implicated in bitter taste sensing. Here we demonstrate, using a combination of genetic, behavioural and physiological studies, that T2R receptors are necessary and sufficient for the detection and perception of bitter compounds, and show that differences in T2Rs between species (human and mouse) can determine the selectivity of bitter taste responses. In addition, we show that mice engineered to express a bitter taste receptor in 'sweet cells' become strongly attracted to its cognate bitter tastants, whereas expression of the same receptor (or even a novel GPCR) in T2R-expressing cells resulted in mice that are averse to the respective compounds. Together these results illustrate the fundamental principle of bitter taste coding at the periphery: dedicated cells act as broadly tuned bitter sensors that are wired to mediate behavioural aversion.
Many clinically important drugs act on the intrinsic membrane proteins (ion channels, receptors, and ion pumps) that control cell excitability. A major goal of pharmacology has been to develop drugs that are more specific for a particular subtype of excitability molecule. DNA cloning has revealed that many excitability proteins are encoded by multigene families and that the diversity of previously recognized pharmacological subtypes is matched, and probably surpassed, by the diversity of messenger RNAs that encode excitability molecules. In general, the diverse subtypes retain their properties when the excitability proteins are expressed in foreign cells such as oocytes and mammalian cell lines. Such heterologous expression may therefore become a tool for testing drugs against specific subtypes. In a systematic research program to exploit this possibility, major considerations include alternative processing of messenger RNA for excitability proteins, coupling to second-messenger systems, and expression of enough protein to provide material for structural studies.
Owing to their sessile nature, plants are constantly exposed to a multitude of environmental stresses to which they react with a battery of responses. The result is plant tolerance to conditions such as excessive or inadequate light, water, salt and temperature, and resistance to pathogens. Not only is plant physiology known to change under abiotic or biotic stress, but changes in the genome have also been identified. However, it was not determined whether plants from successive generations of the original, stressed plants inherited the capacity for genomic change. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana plants treated with short-wavelength radiation (ultraviolet-C) or flagellin (an elicitor of plant defences), somatic homologous recombination of a transgenic reporter is increased in the treated population and these increased levels of homologous recombination persist in the subsequent, untreated generations. The epigenetic trait of enhanced homologous recombination could be transmitted through both the maternal and the paternal crossing partner, and proved to be dominant. The increase of the hyper-recombination state in generations subsequent to the treated generation was independent of the presence of the transgenic allele (the recombination substrate under consideration) in the treated plant. We conclude that environmental factors lead to increased genomic flexibility even in successive, untreated generations, and may increase the potential for adaptation.
Dental morphology of American Indians, Asians, and Pacific islanders is used with a multivariate statistic to estimate when genetic separation occurred between several populations. These estimates generally match independent estimates of separation. This method, called dentochronology, gives an American Indian fission date from Asians of about 13,000 +/- 3,000 years ago, which agrees with archeological data and rules out a European origin because of temporal priority. Polynesians split from Southeast Asians 5,000 +/- 2,200 years ago and are not derived from Melanesians. Ainu-Jomon originated in Sundaland 14,000 +/- 3,300 years ago. Africans have been separated from Asian-Americans 60,000 +/- 6,100 years.
Eastern North America is one of at least six regions of the world where agriculture is thought to have arisen wholly independently. The primary evidence for this hypothesis derives from morphological changes in the archaeobotanical record of three important crops--squash, goosefoot and sunflower--as well as an extinct minor cultigen, sumpweed. However, the geographical origins of two of the three primary domesticates--squash and goosefoot--are now debated, and until recently sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) has been considered the only undisputed eastern North American domesticate. The discovery of 4,000-year-old domesticated sunflower remains from San Andres, Tabasco, implies an earlier and possibly independent origin of domestication in Mexico and has stimulated a re-examination of the geographical origin of domesticated sunflower. Here we describe the genetic relationships and pattern of genetic drift between extant domesticated strains and wild populations collected from throughout the USA and Mexico. We show that extant domesticates arose in eastern North America, with a substantial genetic bottleneck occurring during domestication.
The autosomal dominant trembler mutation (Tr), maps to mouse chromosome 11 (ref. 2) and manifests as a Schwann-cell defect characterized by severe hypomyelination and continuing Schwann-cell proliferation throughout life. Affected animals move clumsily and develop tremor and transient seizures at a young age. We have recently described a potentially growth-regulating myelin protein, peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP-22; refs 7, 8), which is expressed by Schwann cells and found in peripheral myelin. We now report the assignment of the gene for PMP-22 to mouse chromosome 11. Cloning and sequencing of PMP-22 complementary DNAs from inbred Tr mice reveals a point mutation that substitutes an aspartic acid residue for a glycine in a putative membrane-associated domain of the PMP-22 protein. Our results identify the PMP-22 gene as a likely candidate for the mouse trembler locus and will encourage the search for mutations in the corresponding human gene in pedigrees with hypertrophic neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth and Dejerine-Sottas diseases (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies I and III).
The development of queen and worker phenotypes in ants has been believed to be largely determined from environmental effects. We provide evidence that the production of discrete phenotypes is also influenced by genetic interaction effects. During the development of eggs into adults, some patrilines among offspring of multiply mated Pogonomyrmex rugosus ant queens became more common in workers while others became overrepresented in queens. Controlled crosses showed that these changes stem from some parental genome combinations being compatible for producing one phenotype but less compatible for the other. Genetic interaction effects on caste may be maintained over evolutionary time because the fitness of an allele depends on its genetic background.
The Cape flora of South Africa grows in a continental area with many diverse and endemic species. We need to understand the evolutionary origins and ages of such 'hotspots' to conserve them effectively. In volcanic islands the timing of diversification can be precisely measured with potassium-argon dating. In contrast, the history of these continental species is based upon an incomplete fossil record and relatively imprecise isotopic palaeotemperature signatures. Here we use molecular phylogenetics and precise dating of two island species within the same clade as the continental taxa to show recent speciation in a species-rich genus characteristic of the Cape flora. The results indicate that diversification began approximately 7-8 Myr ago, coincident with extensive aridification caused by changes in ocean currents. The recent origin of endemic species diversity in the Cape flora shows that large continental bursts of speciation can occur rapidly over timescales comparable to those previously associated with oceanic island radiations.
The three-dimensional structure of human serum albumin has been determined crystallographically to a resolution of 2.8 A. It comprises three homologous domains that assemble to form a heart-shaped molecule. Each domain is a product of two subdomains that possess common structural motifs. The principal regions of ligand binding to human serum albumin are located in hydrophobic cavities in subdomains IIA and IIIA, which exhibit similar chemistry. The structure explains numerous physical phenomena and should provide insight into future pharmacokinetic and genetically engineered therapeutic applications of serum albumin.
Permanent lymphocytoid cell lines have been established from patients with the XYY and XXY chromosome constitutions. Large amounts of these and other cell lines with genetic defects can be provided for various studies.
We tested the hypothesis that de novo copy number variation (CNV) is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on the genomic DNA of patients and unaffected subjects to detect copy number variants not present in their respective parents. Candidate genomic regions were validated by higher-resolution CGH, paternity testing, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and microsatellite genotyping. Confirmed de novo CNVs were significantly associated with autism (P = 0.0005). Such CNVs were identified in 12 out of 118 (10%) of patients with sporadic autism, in 2 out of 77 (3%) of patients with an affected first-degree relative, and in 2 out of 196 (1%) of controls. Most de novo CNVs were smaller than microscopic resolution. Affected genomic regions were highly heterogeneous and included mutations of single genes. These findings establish de novo germline mutation as a more significant risk factor for ASD than previously recognized.
Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites infesting many animal groups. Lacking mitochondria and peroxysomes, these unicellular eukaryotes were first considered a deeply branching protist lineage that diverged before the endosymbiotic event that led to mitochondria. The discovery of a gene for a mitochondrial-type chaperone combined with molecular phylogenetic data later implied that microsporidia are atypical fungi that lost mitochondria during evolution. Here we report the DNA sequences of the 11 chromosomes of the approximately 2.9-megabase (Mb) genome of Encephalitozoon cuniculi (1,997 potential protein-coding genes). Genome compaction is reflected by reduced intergenic spacers and by the shortness of most putative proteins relative to their eukaryote orthologues. The strong host dependence is illustrated by the lack of genes for some biosynthetic pathways and for the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Phylogenetic analysis lends substantial credit to the fungal affiliation of microsporidia. Because the E. cuniculi genome contains genes related to some mitochondrial functions (for example, Fe-S cluster assembly), we hypothesize that microsporidia have retained a mitochondrion-derived organelle.
The correct timing of flowering is essential for plants to maximize reproductive success and is controlled by environmental and endogenous signals. We report that nitric oxide (NO) repressed the floral transition in Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants treated with NO, as well as a mutant overproducing NO (nox1), flowered late, whereas a mutant producing less NO (nos1) flowered early. NO suppressed CONSTANS and GIGANTEA gene expression and enhanced FLOWERING LOCUS C expression, which indicated that NO regulates the photoperiod and autonomous pathways. Because NO is induced by environmental stimuli and constitutively produced, it may integrate both external and internal cues into the floral decision.
A diverse body of morphological and genetic evidence has suggested that traits pertaining to male reproduction may have evolved much more rapidly than other types of character. Recently, DNA sequence comparisons have also shown a very high level of divergence in male reproductive proteins between closely related Drosophila species, among marine invertebrates and between mouse and rat. Here we show that rapid evolution of male reproductive genes is observable in primates and is quite notable in the lineages to human and chimpanzee. Nevertheless, rapid evolution by itself is not necessarily an indication of positive darwinian selection; relaxation of negative selection is often equally compatible with the DNA sequence data. By taking three statistical approaches, we show that positive darwinian selection is often the driving force behind this rapid evolution. These results open up opportunities to test the hypothesis that sexual selection plays some role in the molecular evolution of higher primates.
Vertebrate speciation in the southwest of Australia has long been viewed as resulting from multiple invasions of eastern source stocks during the Pleistocene. Microcomplement fixation studies of serum albumin evolution in frogs of the genus Heleioporus provide the first hard data on age and phylogenetic relationships among species in this genus and lead to rejection of the multiple invasion model in favor of speciation occurring in Western Australia. The albumin molecular clock was used to estimate that the species divergences in this genus occurred between 4 million to 12 million years ago in the late Tertiary (Pliocene-Miocene), rather than in the Quaternary (the last 2 million years).
There have been few reported family studies of gene segregation in marsupials and no report on genetic linkage in a marsupial species. The paucity of such genetic data probably stems from the lack of marsupial species sufficiently well adapted to a laboratory environment to give the abundant progeny from controlled crosses which are required in such work. A colony of the fat-tailed insectivore Sminthopsis crassicaudata (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae), which was established in the R. A. Fisher Laboratories, University of Adelaide, more than 20 years ago, has now provided unusual linkage data. These data indicate that the linkage situation in this marsupial species differs markedly from that in eutherian mammals. Extremely large differences exist between the sexes in the values of the recombination frequencies, with much closer linkage occurring in females. Cytological examination of meiosis in males and females has revealed a major difference between the sexes in chromosome behaviour.
Insulator DNAs, or boundary elements, functionally isolate neighbouring genes by blocking interactions between distal enhancers and inappropriate target promoters. The best-characterized insulators in Drosophila correspond to a 340-base-pair (bp) fragment from the gypsy retrotransposon, and the scs and scs' sequences flanking the 87A1 hsp70 locus. Here we demonstrate that both insulators block the interaction of defined even-skipped (eve) stripe enhancers when positioned between the enhancer and the target promoter. The simultaneous use of two stripe enhancers (eve stripes 2 and 3) provides evidence that enhancers lying distal to the insulator are selectively blocked. The insertion of stripe-insulator-stripe sequences between two divergently transcribed promoters indicates that enhancers barred from acting on one basal promoter are fully accessible to appropriate regulatory factors for activating the other promoter. These results suggest that insulators do not propagate changes in chromatin structure. Finally, we present evidence that the gypsy insulator does not block interactions between a silencer element and a basal promoter. Taken together, these results suggest that insulators might not be restricted to the functional isolation of neighbouring genetic loci. Rather, they might function as flexible regulatory elements that modulate enhancer-promoter interactions within complex promoters and complex genetic loci.
O'Neil et al. (Reports, 26 September 2008, p. 1828) presented neodymium-142 data for rocks from northern Quebec, Canada, and suggested that these rocks may represent the oldest preserved crustal section on Earth. We argue that the age of the rocks is based on a spurious correlation between rocks that are probably not co-genetic and negative (142)Nd anomalies that may be the result of an analytical artifact.
A single protein (CAD) contains the first three enzymatic activities of de novo uridine biosynthesis. The chromosomal location of CAD genes introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells significantly affects the frequency and cytogenetic result of their amplification. The amplification frequency in one transformant is 100-fold that of the others; in another, amplification of donated genes inserted near a centromere results in chromosome instability and rearrangements.
In studying the genomes of extinct species, two principal limitations are typically the small quantities of endogenous ancient DNA and its degraded condition, even though products of up to 1,600 base pairs (bp) have been amplified in rare cases. Using small overlapping polymerase chain reaction products, longer stretches of sequences or even whole mitochondrial genomes can be reconstructed, but this approach is limited by the number of amplifications that can be performed from rare samples. Thus, even from well-studied Pleistocene species such as mammoths, ground sloths and cave bears, no DNA sequences of more than about 1,000 bp have been reconstructed. Here we report the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Pleistocene woolly mammoth Mammuthus primigenius. We used about 200 mg of bone and a new approach that allows the simultaneous retrieval of multiple sequences from small amounts of degraded DNA. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the mammoth was more closely related to the Asian than to the African elephant. However, the divergence of mammoth, African and Asian elephants occurred over a short time, corresponding to only about 7% of the total length of the phylogenetic tree for the three evolutionary lineages.
Sauropod dinosaurs were the largest animals ever to inhabit the land, with truly gigantic forms in at least three lineages. Small species with an adult body mass less than five tonnes are very rare, and small sauropod bones generally represent juveniles. Here we describe a new diminutive species of basal macronarian sauropod, Europasaurus holgeri gen. et sp. nov., and on the basis of bone histology we show it to have been a dwarf species. The fossils, including excellent skull material, come from Kimmeridgian marine beds of northern Germany, and record more than 11 individuals of sauropods 1.7 to 6.2 m in total body length. Morphological overlap between partial skeletons and isolated bones links all material to the same new taxon. Cortical histology of femora and tibiae indicates that size differences within the specimens are due to different ontogenetic stages, from juveniles to fully grown individuals. The little dinosaurs must have lived on one of the large islands around the Lower Saxony basin. Comparison with the long-bone histology of large-bodied sauropods suggests that the island dwarf species evolved through a decrease in growth rate from its larger ancestor.
The genetic variation that occurs naturally in a population is a powerful resource for studying how genotype affects phenotype. Each allele is a perturbation of the biological system, and genetic crosses, through the processes of recombination and segregation, randomize the distribution of these alleles among the progeny of a cross. The randomized genetic perturbations affect traits directly and indirectly, and the similarities and differences between traits in their responses to common perturbations allow inferences about whether variation in a trait is a cause of a phenotype (such as disease) or whether the trait variation is, instead, an effect of that phenotype. It is then possible to use this information about causes and effects to build models of probabilistic 'causal networks'. These networks are beginning to define the outlines of the 'genotype-phenotype map'.
An efficient system for genetic modification and large-scale cloning of cattle is of importance for agriculture, biotechnology, and human medicine. Here, actively dividing fetal fibroblasts were genetically modified with a marker gene, a clonal line was selected, and the cells were fused to enucleated mature oocytes. Out of 28 embryos transferred to 11 recipient cows, three healthy, identical, transgenic calves were generated. Furthermore, the life-span of near senescent fibroblasts could be extended by nuclear transfer, as indicated by population doublings in fibroblast lines derived from a 40-day-old fetal clone. With the ability to extend the life-span of these primary cultured cells, this system would be useful for inducing complex genetic modifications in cattle.
We report the observation of neural processing that occurs within 265 milliseconds after outcome stimuli that inform human participants about gains and losses in a gambling task. A negative-polarity event-related brain potential, probably generated by a medial-frontal region in or near the anterior cingulate cortex, was greater in amplitude when a participant's choice between two alternatives resulted in a loss than when it resulted in a gain. The sensitivity to losses was not simply a reflection of detecting an error; gains did not elicit the medial-frontal activity when the alternative choice would have yielded a greater gain, and losses elicited the activity even when the alternative choice would have yielded a greater loss. Choices made after losses were riskier and were associated with greater loss-related activity than choices made after gains. It follows that medial-frontal computations may contribute to mental states that participate in higher level decisions, including economic choices.
Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites in spatially structured populations can result in local adaptation of parasites; that is, the greater infectivity of local parasites than foreign parasites on local hosts. Such parasite specialization on local hosts has implications for human health and agriculture. By contrast with classic single-species population-genetic models, theory indicates that parasite migration between subpopulations might increase parasite local adaptation, as long as migration does not completely homogenize populations. To test this hypothesis we developed a system-specific mathematical model and then coevolved replicate populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and a parasitic bacteriophage with parasite only, with host only or with no migration. Here we show that patterns of local adaptation have considerable temporal and spatial variation and that, in the absence of migration, parasites tend to be locally maladapted. However, in accord with our model, parasite migration results in parasite local adaptation, but host migration alone has no significant effect.
Chromosomal rearrangements involving the c-myc oncogene are a prevalent feature of plasmacytomas that arise after inoculating BALB/c mice with pristane and Abelson murine leukaemia virus (A-MuLV). With this observation in mind, we decided to determine if any genetic alterations of the c-myc locus could be observed in cells of a different type, when transformed in vitro by A-MuLV. Here we have analysed three independent A-MuLV-transformed NIH 3T3 lines (ANN-I, 54c12 and N25), and found that the c-myc locus is amplified 8-19-fold in each transformant. Quantitative S1 nuclease mapping performed on ANN-I and 54c12 RNAs demonstrated that: (1) c-myc messenger RNAs accumulated to double the levels found in NIH 3T3 cells; and (2) a shift in the use of the two normal c-myc transcription initiation sites (P1 and P2) occurred in favour of the 3' site, P2. Analysis of c-myc chromatin by DNase I treatment of 54c12 nuclei revealed that most, if not all, of the c-myc gene copies were transcriptionally competent. We present alternative ideas to explain why amplification of the c-myc gene occurs repeatedly in A-MuLV-transformed fibroblasts. Finally, we discuss our results in relation to the hypothesis linking the phenomenon of tumour progression with the amplification of oncogenes.
Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a five-year mortality of 97-98%, usually due to widespread metastatic disease. Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations, but genomic rearrangements have not been characterized in detail. Despite the clinical importance of metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic tumours, including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of ongoing parallel evolution in metastatic and primary sites, and how the tumour disseminates. Here we harness advances in DNA sequencing to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle control, namely dysregulated G1-to-S-phase transition with intact G2-M checkpoint. These initiate amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than the later stages of the disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting in ongoing, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells, that seeding metastasis may require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours, and that phylogenetic trees across metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in cancer, brought about by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection.
Noggin is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist expressed in Spemann's organizer. Murine Noggin is expressed in condensing cartilage and immature chondrocytes, as are many BMPs. In mice lacking Noggin, cartilage condensations initiated normally but developed hyperplasia, and initiation of joint development failed as measured by the expression of growth and differentiation factor-5. The maturation of cartilage and Hoxd expression were unaffected. Excess BMP activity in the absence of Noggin antagonism may enhance the recruitment of cells into cartilage, resulting in oversized growth plates; chondrocytes are also refractory to joint-inducing positional cues.
Although the application of sequencing-by-synthesis techniques to DNA extracted from bones has revolutionized the study of ancient DNA, it has been plagued by large fractions of contaminating environmental DNA. The genetic analyses of hair shafts could be a solution: We present 10 previously unexamined Siberian mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) mitochondrial genomes, sequenced with up to 48-fold coverage. The observed levels of damage-derived sequencing errors were lower than those observed in previously published frozen bone samples, even though one of the specimens was >50,000 14C years old and another had been stored for 200 years at room temperature. The method therefore sets the stage for molecular-genetic analysis of museum collections.
Calorie restriction extends life-span in a wide variety of organisms. Although it has been suggested that calorie restriction may work by reducing the levels of reactive oxygen species produced during respiration, the mechanism by which this regimen slows aging is uncertain. Here, we mimicked calorie restriction in yeast by physiological or genetic means and showed a substantial extension in life-span. This extension was not observed in strains mutant for SIR2 (which encodes the silencing protein Sir2p) or NPT1 (a gene in a pathway in the synthesis of NAD, the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). These findings suggest that the increased longevity induced by calorie restriction requires the activation of Sir2p by NAD.
The Louisville Twin Study, referred to on page 600 (column 2) of "The genetics of personality" by Constance Holden (Research News, 7 Aug., p. 598), was started in 1957 by Frank Falkner, a pediatrician at the University of Louisville, not by Ronald Wilson, as stated in the article.
Dispersal has a significant impact on lifetime reproductive success, and is often more prevalent in one sex than the other. In group-living mammals, dispersal is normally male-biased and in theory this sexual bias could be a response by males to female mate preferences, competition for access to females or resources, or the result of males avoiding inbreeding. There is a lack of studies on social mammals that simultaneously assess these factors and measure the fitness consequences of male dispersal decisions. Here we show that male-biased dispersal in the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) most probably results from an adaptive response by males to simple female mate-choice rules that have evolved to avoid inbreeding. Microsatellite profiling revealed that females preferred sires that were born into or immigrated into the female's group after the female was born. Furthermore, young females preferred short-tenured sires and older females preferred longer-tenured sires. Males responded to these female mate preferences by initiating their reproductive careers in groups containing the highest number of young females. As a consequence, 11% of males started their reproductive career in their natal group and 89% of males dispersed. Males that started reproduction in groups containing the highest number of young females had a higher long-term reproductive success than males that did not. The female mate-choice rules ensured that females effectively avoided inbreeding without the need to discriminate directly against close kin or males born in their own group, or to favour immigrant males. The extent of male dispersal as a response to such female mate preferences depends on the demographic structure of breeding groups, rather than the genetic relatedness between females and males.
The mammalian olfactory system detects and discriminates thousands of odorants using many different receptors expressed by sensory neurons in the nasal epithelium. Axonal projections from these neurons to the main olfactory bulbs form reproducible patterns of glomeruli in two widely separated regions of each bulb, creating two mirror-symmetric maps of odorant receptor projections. To investigate whether odorant receptors organize neural circuitry in the olfactory bulb, we have examined a genetically modified mouse line, rI7 --> M71, in which a functionally characterized receptor, rI7, has been substituted into the M71 receptor locus. Here we show that despite their ectopic location the resulting glomeruli are responsive to known ligands of the rI7 receptor, attract postsynaptic innervation by mitral/tufted cell dendrites, and endow these cells with responses that are characteristic of the rI7 receptor. External tufted cells receiving input from rI7 --> M71 glomeruli form precise intrabulbar projections that link medial and lateral rI7 --> M71 glomeruli anatomically, thus providing a substrate for coordinating isofunctional glomeruli. We conclude that odorant receptor identity in epithelial neurons determines not only glomerular convergence and function, but also functional circuitry in the olfactory bulb.
The coastal uplift(approximately 40 to 60 centimeters) associated with the Chilean earthquake of 3 March 1985 caused extensive mortality of intertidal organisms at the Estacion Costera de Investigaciones Marinas, Las Cruces. The kelp belt of the laminarian Lessonia nigrescens was particularly affected. Most of the primary space liberated at the upper border of this belt was invaded by species of barnacles, which showed an opportunistic colonization strategy. Drastic modifications in the environment such as coastal uplift, subsidence, or the effects of the El Nino phenomenon are characteristic of the southern Pacific. Modifications in the marine ecosystem that generate catastrophic and widespread mortalities of intertidal organisms can affect species composition, diversity, or local biogeography.
Ecological speciation occurs when ecologically based, divergent selection causes the evolution of reproductive isolation. There are many empirical examples of this process; however, there exists a poorly characterized stage during which the traits that distinguish species ecologically and reproductively segregate in a single population. By using a combination of genetic mapping, mate-choice experiments, field observations, and population genetics, we studied a butterfly population with a mimetic wing color polymorphism and found that the butterflies exhibited partial, color-based, assortative mate preference. These traits represent the divergent, ecologically based signal and preference components of sexual isolation that usually distinguish incipient and sibling species. The association between behavior and recognition trait in a single population may enhance the probability of speciation and provides an example of the missing link between an interbreeding population and isolated species.
The large, morphologically peculiar microorganism Epulopiscium fishelsoni inhabits the intestinal tract of Acanthurus nigrofuscus, a brown surgeonfish (family Acanthuridae) from the Red Sea. Similar microorganisms have been found in surgeonfish species from the Great Barrier Reef. As these microorganisms have only been seen in surgeonfish and no free-living forms have been found, they are considered to be specific symbionts of surgeonfish, although the nature of the symbiosis is unclear. Initial reports considered them to be eukaryotic protists, based primarily on their size, with individuals being larger than 600 microns by 80 microns. But their cellular morphology in the electron microscope is more like that of bacterial than eukaryotic cells. To resolve the nature of these symbionts, we have isolated the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA from two morphotypes and used them in a phylogenetic analysis. In situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes based on the cloned rRNA sequences confirmed the source of the rRNA genes. Our result identify the symbionts as members of the low-(G+C) Gram-positive group of bacteria. They are therefore the largest bacteria to be described so far.
The response of the visual system to intermittent stimulation at rates above the fusion point is generally considered to be independent of frequency, that is, linear with respect to time-average luminance. However, trains of 1000 light pulses per second alternated successively with trains of 500 light pulses per second may be perceived as flickering even though the time-average luminance is the same in each train.
Several microorganisms, including Yersinia sp., Salmonella sp., Brucella sp., Mycobacterium sp. and Leishmania sp., have successfully adapted to grow within macrophage phagolysosomes. Infections caused by these intracellular pathogens are among the most difficult to treat. As part of an antimicrobial strategy directed at modifying the phagolysosomal environment to the disadvantage of these important pathogens, we are defining the ambient conditions within the organism-containing phagolysosome. To probe this environment, we have used Yersinia pestis, whose expression of several virulence attributes is highly dependent on the Ca2+ concentration in its growth environment. We first genetically engineered a strain of Y. pestis which responds to a low-calcium environment by transcription of inserted structural genes of the Escherichia coli lac operon. Using this mutant organism as a relevant biological probe, we demonstrate here that the calcium concentration in Y. pestis-containing phagolysosomes is sufficiently low to permit virulence gene expression; this resolves the question of where Y. pestis might express its Ca2+-regulated genes in vivo.
Captive breeding is used to supplement populations of many species that are declining in the wild. The suitability of and long-term species survival from such programs remain largely untested, however. We measured lifetime reproductive success of the first two generations of steelhead trout that were reared in captivity and bred in the wild after they were released. By reconstructing a three-generation pedigree with microsatellite markers, we show that genetic effects of domestication reduce subsequent reproductive capabilities by approximately 40% per captive-reared generation when fish are moved to natural environments. These results suggest that even a few generations of domestication may have negative effects on natural reproduction in the wild and that the repeated use of captive-reared parents to supplement wild populations should be carefully reconsidered.
In the article "Genetic testing set for takeoff" by Rachel Nowak (News & Comment, 22 July, p. 464), Helix was cited as the source of information for the accompanying table describing genetic testing (p. 466). The information in the table regarding mutational mechanism, cost, and market size came from sources identified by Helix who were contacted separately.
Type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) are vitally involved in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Here, we show that a synthetic growth inhibitor called pyrabactin functions as a selective ABA agonist. Pyrabactin acts through PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE 1 (PYR1), the founding member of a family of START proteins called PYR/PYLs, which are necessary for both pyrabactin and ABA signaling in vivo. We show that ABA binds to PYR1, which in turn binds to and inhibits PP2Cs. We conclude that PYR/PYLs are ABA receptors functioning at the apex of a negative regulatory pathway that controls ABA signaling by inhibiting PP2Cs. Our results illustrate the power of the chemical genetic approach for sidestepping genetic redundancy.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), including the fly homologue Decapentaplegic (DPP), are important regulators of early vertebrate and invertebrate dorsal-ventral development. An evolutionarily conserved BMP regulatory mechanism operates from fly to fish, frog and mouse to control the dorsal-ventral axis determination. Several secreted factors, including the BMP antagonist chordin/Short gastrulation (SOG), modulate the activity of BMPs. In Drosophila, Twisted gastrulation (TSG) is also involved in dorsal-ventral patterning, yet the mechanism of its function is unclear. Here we report the characterization of the vertebrate Tsg homologues. We show that Tsg can block BMP function in Xenopus embryonic explants and inhibits several ventral markers in whole-frog embryos. Tsg binds directly to BMPs and forms a ternary complex with chordin and BMPs. Coexpression of Tsg with chordin leads to a more efficient inhibition of the BMP activity in ectodermal explants. Unlike other known BMP antagonists, however, Tsg also reduces several anterior markers at late developmental stages. Our data suggest that Tsg can function as a BMP inhibitor in Xenopus; furthermore, Tsg may have additional functions during frog embryogenesis.
The transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion was a key development in vertebrate evolution. We present a spinal cord model and its implementation in an amphibious salamander robot that demonstrates how a primitive neural circuit for swimming can be extended by phylogenetically more recent limb oscillatory centers to explain the ability of salamanders to switch between swimming and walking. The model suggests neural mechanisms for modulation of velocity, direction, and type of gait that are relevant for all tetrapods. It predicts that limb oscillatory centers have lower intrinsic frequencies than body oscillatory centers, and we present biological data supporting this.
How reversible is adaptive evolution? Studies of microbes give mixed answers to this question. Reverse evolution has been little studied in sexual populations, even though the population genetics of sexual populations may be quite different. In the present study, 25 diverged replicated populations of Drosophila melanogaster are returned to a common ancestral environment for 50 generations. Here we show that reverse evolution back to the ancestral state occurs, but is not universal, instead depending on previous evolutionary history and the character studied. Hybrid populations showed no greater tendency to undergo successful reverse evolution, suggesting that insufficient genetic variation was not the factor limiting reverse evolution. Adaptive reverse evolution is a contingent process which occurs with only 50 generations of sexual reproduction.
The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the dominant oxygenic phototroph in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world's oceans. It can grow at a range of depths over which light intensities can vary by up to 4 orders of magnitude. This broad depth distribution has been hypothesized to stem from the coexistence of genetically different populations adapted for growth at high- and low-light intensities. Here we report direct evidence supporting this hypothesis, which has been generated by isolating and analysing distinct co-occurring populations of Prochlorococcus at two locations in the North Atlantic. Co-isolates from the same water sample have very different light-dependent physiologies, one growing maximally at light intensities at which the other is completely photoinhibited. Despite this ecotypic differentiation, the co-isolates have 97% similarity in their 16S ribosomal RNA sequences, demonstrating that molecular microdiversity, commonly observed in microbial systems, can be due to the coexistence of closely related, physiologically distinct populations. The coexistence and distribution of multiple ecotypes permits the survival of the population as a whole over a broader range of environmental conditions than would be possible for a homogeneous population.
Infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum leads to widely different clinical conditions in children, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to coma and death. Despite the immense medical implications, the genetic and molecular basis of this diversity remains largely unknown. Studies of in vitro gene expression have found few transcriptional differences between different parasite strains. Here we present a large study of in vivo expression profiles of parasites derived directly from blood samples from infected patients. The in vivo expression profiles define three distinct transcriptional states. The biological basis of these states can be interpreted by comparison with an extensive compendium of expression data in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The three states in vivo closely resemble, first, active growth based on glycolytic metabolism, second, a starvation response accompanied by metabolism of alternative carbon sources, and third, an environmental stress response. The glycolytic state is highly similar to the known profile of the ring stage in vitro, but the other states have not been observed in vitro. The results reveal a previously unknown physiological diversity in the in vivo biology of the malaria parasite, in particular evidence for a functional mitochondrion in the asexual-stage parasite, and indicate in vivo and in vitro studies to determine how this variation may affect disease manifestations and treatment.
A gene bank of DNA from the Lyme disease spirochete was constructed in the plasmid pBR322. Plasmid pTRH32, a recombinant that in Escherichia coli expresses the two major outer surface proteins of the Lyme disease spirochete, was identified. One of the recombinant products, designated OspA, represents a surface protein that appears to be common to all Lyme disease spirochetes, whereas the other recombinant product, designated OspB, represents a more variable surface protein. This recombinant plasmid provides a foundation for future studies on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of Lyme disease as well as on the genetic organization of the etiologic agent.
The genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like those of other eukaryotes, contains multiple sequences that hybridize with a poly(GT) probe. We have shown previously that some of the sequences that hybridize with the poly(GT) probe are located near the tips of the yeast chromosomes. We report here that many of the remaining poly(GT)-hybridizing sequences are associated with a family of putative replication origins localized near the chromosome ends. These sequences have the general form poly(C1-3A), similar to sequences reported to occur at the tips of chromosomes in the accompanying paper. In addition to poly(C1-3A) tracts, yeast cells contain tracts of alternating C and A bases, similar to those seen in mammalian genomes. These results are used as the basis for a new model of telomere replication.
The degradation of messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells is initiated by endonucleolytic cleavage or by shortening of the poly(A) tail, which for some mRNAs activates a deadenylation-dependent decapping reaction. One type of rapid mRNA degradation in eukaryotes is caused by premature termination of translation. This turnover process prevents the translation of aberrant mRNAs, may affect the abundance and splicing pattern of nuclear transcripts, and may be involved in the aetiology of human genetic disease. Here we show that premature translational termination in yeast triggers decapping, independent of deadenylation, thereby exposing the transcript to 5'-to-3' degradation. Inactivation of the 5'-to-3' exonuclease reveals an additional 3'-to-5' pathway of mRNA turnover. These observations provide in vivo evidence for two new mechanisms of mRNA decay.
Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P < 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.
In Drosophila, the Dorsal protein establishes the embryonic dorso-ventral axis during development. Here we show that the vertebrate homologue of Dorsal, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), is vital for the formation of the proximo-distal organizer of the developing limb bud, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Transcription of the NF-kappaB proto-oncogene c-rel is regulated, in part, during morphogenesis of the limb bud by AER-derived signals such as fibroblast growth factors. Interruption of NF-kappaB activity using viral-mediated delivery of an inhibitor results in a highly dysmorphic AER, reduction in overall limb size, loss of distal elements and reversal in the direction of limb outgrowth. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in limb mesenchyme leads to a reduction in expression of Sonic hedgehog and Twist but derepresses expression of the bone morphogenetic protein-4 gene. These results are the first evidence that vertebrate NF-kappaB proteins act to transmit growth factor signals between the ectoderm and the underlying mesenchyme during embryonic limb formation.
A paramyxovirus virus termed Nipah virus has been identified as the etiologic agent of an outbreak of severe encephalitis in people with close contact exposure to pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. The outbreak was first noted in late September 1998 and by mid-June 1999, more than 265 encephalitis cases, including 105 deaths, had been reported in Malaysia, and 11 cases of encephalitis or respiratory illness with one death had been reported in Singapore. Electron microscopic, serologic, and genetic studies indicate that this virus belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and is most closely related to the recently discovered Hendra virus. We suggest that these two viruses are representative of a new genus within the family Paramyxoviridae. Like Hendra virus, Nipah virus is unusual among the paramyxoviruses in its ability to infect and cause potentially fatal disease in a number of host species, including humans.
Thermodynamic properties of matter generally depend on the details of interactions between its constituent parts. However, in a unitary Fermi gas where the scattering length diverges, thermodynamics is determined through universal functions that depend only on the particle density and temperature. By using only the general form of the equation of state and the equation of force balance, we measured the local internal energy of the trapped gas as a function of these parameters. Other universal functions, such as those corresponding to the Helmholtz free energy, chemical potential, and entropy, were calculated through general thermodynamic relations. The critical parameters were also determined at the superfluid transition temperature. These results apply to all strongly interacting fermionic systems, including neutron stars and nuclear matter.
The ubiquity of mechanisms that generate genetic variation has spurred arguments that evolvability, the ability to generate adaptive variation, has itself evolved in response to natural selection. The high mutation rate of RNA viruses is postulated to be an adaptation for evolvability, but the paradox is that whereas some RNA viruses evolve at high rates, others are highly stable. Here we show that evolvability in the RNA bacteriophage phi6 is also determined by the accessibility of advantageous genotypes within the mutational neighbourhood (the set of mutants one or a few mutational steps away). We found that two phi6 populations that were derived from a single ancestral phage repeatedly evolved at different rates and toward different fitness maxima. Fitness measurements of individual phages showed that the fitness distribution of mutants differed between the two populations. Whereas population A, which evolved toward a higher maximum, had a distribution that contained many advantageous mutants, population B, which evolved toward a lower maximum, had a distribution that contained only deleterious mutants. We interpret these distributions to measure the fitness effects of genotypes that are mutationally available to the two populations. Thus, the evolvability of phi6 is constrained by the distribution of its mutational neighbours, despite the fact that this phage has the characteristic high mutation rate of RNA viruses.
Cancer cells have diverse biological capabilities that are conferred by numerous genetic aberrations and epigenetic modifications. Today's powerful technologies are enabling these changes to the genome to be catalogued in detail. Tomorrow is likely to bring a complete atlas of the reversible and irreversible alterations that occur in individual cancers. The challenge now is to work out which molecular abnormalities contribute to cancer and which are simply 'noise' at the genomic and epigenomic levels. Distinguishing between these will aid in understanding how the aberrations in a cancer cell collaborate to drive pathophysiology. Past successes in converting information from genomic discoveries into clinical tools provide valuable lessons to guide the translation of emerging insights from the genome into clinical end points that can affect the practice of cancer medicine.
Nearly a century has been spent collecting and preserving genetic diversity in plants. Germplasm banks-living seed collections that serve as repositories of genetic variation-have been established as a source of genes for improving agricultural crops. Genetic linkage maps have made it possible to study the chromosomal locations of genes for improving yield and other complex traits important to agriculture. The tools of genome research may finally unleash the genetic potential of our wild and cultivated germplasm resources for the benefit of society.
Agent-based complex systems are dynamic networks of many interacting agents; examples include ecosystems, financial markets, and cities. The search for general principles underlying the internal organization of such systems often uses bottom-up simulation models such as cellular automata and agent-based models. No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling. This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity.
Plants may "eavesdrop" on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by herbivore-attacked neighbors to activate defenses before being attacked themselves. Transcriptome and signal cascade analyses of VOC-exposed plants suggest that plants eavesdrop to prime direct and indirect defenses and to hone competitive abilities. Advances in research on VOC biosynthesis and perception have facilitated the production of plants that are genetically "deaf" to particular VOCs or "mute" in elements of their volatile vocabulary. Such plants, together with advances in VOC analytical instrumentation, will allow researchers to determine whether fluency enhances the fitness of plants in natural communities.
Obesity is a disorder of energy balance, indicating a chronic disequilibrium between energy intake and expenditure. Recently, the mouse ob gene, and subsequently its human and rat homologues, have been cloned. The ob gene product, leptin, is expressed exclusively in adipose tissue, and appears to be a signalling factor regulating body-weight homeostasis and energy balance. Because the level of ob gene expression might indicate the size of the adipose depot, we suggest that it is regulated by factors modulating adipose tissue size. Here we show that ob gene exhibits diurnal variation, increasing during the night, after rats start eating. This variation was linked to changes in food intake, as fasting prevented the cyclic variation and decreased ob messenger RNA. Furthermore, refeeding fasted rats restored ob mRNA within 4 hours to levels of fed animals. A single insulin injection in fasted animals increased ob mRNA to levels of fed controls. Experiments to control glucose and insulin independently in animals, and studies in primary adipocytes, showed that insulin regulates ob gene expression directly in rats, regardless of its glucose-lowering effects. Whereas the ob gene product, leptin, has been shown to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure, our data demonstrate that ob gene expression is increased after food ingestion in rats, perhaps through a direct action of insulin on the adipocyte.
Many eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences (IVS), but the rationale for their existence remains a mystery. Previous studies done in our laboratory demonstrated that the intron in a yeast tRNATyr gene, SUP6, does have a function. We used the same approach to determine the role of introns in nuclear genes encoding messenger RNAs. A single actin gene with one intron exists in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The level of actin in yeast appears to be crucial to viability: either too much or too little actin inhibits growth. Therefore, small effects on synthesis of actin protein resulting from the removal of the actin gene intron would be expected to cause measurable changes in cell growth. In the present study, an intron-deleted actin gene was constructed in vitro and was used to replace the single resident actin gene in a haploid strain. Analysis of the cells carrying the intron-deleted actin gene shows that the intervening sequence is not essential for actin gene expression.
Environmental stimuli that are reliably associated with the effects of many abused drugs, especially stimulants such as cocaine, can produce craving and relapse in abstinent human substance abusers. In animals, such cues can induce and maintain drug-seeking behaviour and also reinstate drug-seeking after extinction. Reducing the motivational effects of drug-related cues might therefore be useful in the treatment of addiction. Converging pharmacological, human post-mortem and genetic studies implicate the dopamine D3 receptor in drug addiction. Here we have designed BP 897, the first D3-receptor-selective agonist, as assessed in vitro with recombinant receptors and in vivo with mice bearing disrupted D3-receptor genes. BP 897 is a partial agonist in vitro and acts in vivo as either an agonist or an antagonist. We show that BP 897 inhibits cocaine-seeking behaviour that depends upon the presentation of drug-associated cues, without having any intrinsic, primary rewarding effects. Our data indicate that compounds like BP 897 could be used for reducing the drug craving and vulnerability to relapse that are elicited by drug-associated environmental stimuli.
Many of the newly discovered seedoil acids have reactive or unusual functional groups or other facets of molecular structure that permit their ready differentiation from oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and the other most prevalent saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids. The recognition and availability of the new acids, coupled with methods that make detection and determination easy, will help studies of lipid biosynthesis in the plant and of lipid metabolism and utilization in animals, and will stimulate more studies in depth on the fine points of seedlipid structure. Correlations of structural patterns in seed lipids of particular groups of plants with classical taxonomic categories will permit clarifications, raise needed questions concerning classifications, and accelerate research in chemotaxonomy and phylogenetics. Seed lipids are particularly well suited for establishing relationships among plants because of their great variety in structure compared to the more limited structural types of amino acids, sugars, purines, and many other plant substances. The newly characterized seed oils are potentially important industrial raw materials whenever they come from agronomically promising plant species. The molecular structures of seed triglycerides have major influence on their physical properties and therefore advances in knowledge in that sphere have practical implications. For example, the unusual characteristics of cocoa butter that make it so valuable for food and confectionery use are attributed to the specific arrangement of fatty acids it its triglycerides. The glycerides are almost all 2-oleic-1,3-disaturated acid triglycerides. The physical characteristics of lard are advantageously changed by catalytically rearranging fatty acyl groups among the glycerides initially in the fat to achieve a more nearly random distribution, followed sometimes by further fractionation to remove more saturated glycerides. Through this change of glyceride structures a preferred, less grainy texture is achieved. Future studies to understand, unravel, and control seed-oil triglyceride structures will be significant in developing margarines of improved texture and "feel," cocoa-butter substitutes, and many other products. I expect rapid, fruitful progress in seedlipid research and utilization to continue. Such progress will be aided by investigation of seed lipids from a large number and variety of different plants to find new types of fatty acids, to find new sources of familiar oils, and to obtain more data regarding their glyceride structures.
Satellite DNA refers to a class of tandem repeats of very simple sequences, usually A + T or G + C rich, which form a satellite band on a CsCl gradient. Their ubiquity and abundance in higher eukaryotes have led to speculation about their functions. It has often been suggested that satellite DNAs are merely innocuous genetic parasites or comprise 'junk' DNA. The recent identification of an array of satellite DNA repeats as the Responder (Rsp) locus of Drosophila melanogaster provides a new perspective on these elements. Rsp is in the centromeric heterochromatin of most natural second chromosomes. It causes spermatids bearing it to degenerate after meiosis when the homologous second chromosome is a Segregation Distorter (SD) chromosome. That is, SD targets the Rsp locus on its homologue for destruction during spermatogenesis, causing meiotic drive. Why then does the Rsp locus, a large array of satellite repeats, exist at all? One plausible explanation is that its existence contributes to the fitness of flies bearing it, compensating for the loss through meiotic drive. A direct demonstration of the usefulness of any family of satellite DNA is to compare the fitnesses of individuals with and without it. Previously, such an experiment has been difficult because the absence of a characteristic phenotype has precluded an efficient selection of deletion mutations. In this report we attempt to demonstrate a fitness reduction associated with the deletion of Rsp satellite DNA as well as the life stages at which such a reduction occurs.
Hypocalcemic vitamin D-resistant rickets is a human genetic disease resulting from target organ resistance to the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Two families with affected children homozygous for this autosomal recessive disorder were studied for abnormalities in the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its gene. Although the receptor displays normal binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 hormone, VDR from affected family members has a decreased affinity for DNA. Genomic DNA isolated from these families was subjected to oligonucleotide-primed DNA amplification, and each of the nine exons encoding the receptor protein was sequenced for a genetic mutation. In each family, a different single nucleotide mutation was found in the DNA binding domain of the protein; one family near the tip of the first zinc finger (Gly----Asp) and one at the tip of the second zinc finger (Arg----Gly). The mutant residues were created in vitro by oligonucleotide directed point mutagenesis of wild-type VDR complementary DNA and this cDNA was transfected into COS-1 cells. The produced protein is biochemically indistinguishable from the receptor isolated from patients.
The mutation brachypodism (bp) alters the length and number of bones in the limbs of mice but spares the axial skeleton. It illustrates the importance of specific genes in controlling the morphogenesis of individual skeletal elements in the tetrapod limb. We now report the isolation of three new members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily (growth/differentiation factors (GDF) 5,6 and 7) and show by mapping, expression patterns and sequencing that mutations in Gdf5 are responsible for skeletal alterations in bp mice. GDF5 and the closely related GDF6 and GDF7 define a new subgroup of factors related to known bone- and cartilage-inducing molecules, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Studies of Bmp5 mutations in short ear mice have shown that at least one other BMP gene is also required for normal skeletal development. The highly specific skeletal alterations in bp and short ear mice suggest that different members of the BMP family control the formation of different morphological features in the mammalian skeleton.
Nearly 30 hereditary disorders in humans result from an increase in the number of copies of simple repeats in genomic DNA. These DNA repeats seem to be predisposed to such expansion because they have unusual structural features, which disrupt the cellular replication, repair and recombination machineries. The presence of expanded DNA repeats alters gene expression in human cells, leading to disease. Surprisingly, many of these debilitating diseases are caused by repeat expansions in the non-coding regions of their resident genes. It is becoming clear that the peculiar structures of repeat-containing transcripts are at the heart of the pathogenesis of these diseases.
Many angiosperms employ self-incompatibility systems to prevent inbreeding. The simple genetics of such systems have made them attractive models of plant cellular communication. Implicit in the single locus genetics is that only one or a few gene products are necessary for recognition and rejection of incompatible pollen. Results in the sporophytic system of the Brassicaceae suggest that different S-locus products are responsible for the pollen and pistil parts of the recognition and rejection response. In solanaeceous plants, which have a gametophytic self-incompatibility system, the S locus product responsible for the pollen portion of the interaction has not been identified, but ribonucleases encoded by the S-locus (S-RNases) are strongly implicated in the style part of the recognition and rejection reaction. In Nicotiana alata, pollen recognition and rejection occur if its S-allele matches either S-allele in the style. The putative stylar S-RNase is abundant in the transmitting tract, and pollen rejection may be related to action of S-RNase on pollen RNAs. Efforts to understand the molecular basis for pollen recognition and rejection have been limited by the lack of a system for manipulating and expressing S-RNases. Here we use the promoter of a style-expressed gene from tomato to obtain high levels of S-RNase expression in transgenic Nicotiana. Recognition and rejection of N. alata pollen S-alleles occur faithfully in the transgenic plants. Our results show that S-RNases alone are sufficient for pollen rejection in this system.
Evolutionary ecologists are attempting to explain how parents make behavioural decisions about how much care to provide to their young. Theory predicts that when genetic relatedness to young is decreased by cuckoldry, for example, parents should reduce their care in favour of alternative broods that provide greater reproductive success. Experimental manipulation of perceived paternity has been used to test the theory, but such studies have generated mixed results. Some manipulations can fail to alter a parent's perceived paternity, whereas others may directly affect parental behaviour when, for instance, the manipulation involves capturing the parent. No study has demonstrated parental care adjustment in a manner uncomplicated by experimental design or life history correlates. Here I test the theory using the fact that nest-tending parental male bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) can assess their paternity using both the visual presence of parasitic cuckolder males during spawning, and olfactory cues released by newly hatched eggs. By manipulating both types of cues I show that parental males dynamically adjust their parental care, favouring broods that are apparently most closely related. These results confirm the importance of genetic relatedness in parental care decision-making.
In addition to its well-documented effects on gene silencing, cytosine methylation is a prominent cause of mutations. In humans, the mutation rate from 5-methylcytosine (m5C) to thymine (T) is 10-50-fold higher than other transitions and the methylated sequence CpG is consequently under-represented. Over one-third of germline point mutations associated with human genetic disease and many somatic mutations leading to cancer involve loss of CpG. The primary cause of mutability appears to be hydrolytic deamination. Cytosine deamination produces mismatched uracil (U), which can be removed by uracil glycosylase, whereas m5C deamination generates a G x T mispair that cannot be processed by this enzyme. Correction of m5CpG x TpG mismatches may instead be initiated by the thymine DNA glycosylase, TDG. Here we show that MBD4, an unrelated mammalian protein that contains a methyl-CpG binding domain, can also efficiently remove thymine or uracil from a mismatches CpG site in vitro. Furthermore, the methyl-CpG binding domain of MBD4 binds preferentially to m5CpG x TpG mismatches-the primary product of deamination at methyl-CpG. The combined specificities of binding and catalysis indicate that this enzyme may function to minimize mutation at methyl-CpG.
Epigenetic modifications change transcription patterns in multicellular organisms to achieve tissue-specific gene expression and inactivate alien DNA such as transposons or transgenes. In plants and animals, DNA methylation is involved in heritability and flexibility of epigenetic states, although its function is far from clear. We have isolated an Arabidopsis gene, MOM, whose product is required for the maintenance of transcriptional gene silencing. Mutation of this gene or depletion of its transcript by expression of antisense RNA reactivates transcription from several previously silent, heavily methylated loci. Despite this, the dense methylation at these reactivated loci is maintained even after nine generations, indicating that transcriptional activity and methylation pattern are inherited independently. The predicted MOM gene product is a nuclear protein of 2,001 amino acids containing a region similar to part of the ATPase region of the SWI2/SNF2 family, members of which are involved in chromatin remodelling. MOM is the first known molecular component that is essential for transcriptional gene silencing and does not affect methylation pattern. Thus, it may act downstream of methylation in epigenetic regulation, or be part of a new pathway that does not require methylation marks.
The molecular mechanisms that maintain totipotency of the germline are not well understood. Here, we show that two conserved translational regulators, MEX-3 and GLD-1, are essential for maintaining totipotency in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline. In mex-3 gld-1 mutants, germ cells transdifferentiate into various somatic cell types such as muscles or neurons. Our findings implicate RNA regulation in the maintenance of totipotency, suggest that multiple mechanisms maintain totipotency at different stages of germline development, and establish a genetically tractable model for studying the development of teratomas.
The lin-12 gene seems to control certain binary decisions during Caenorhabditis elegans development, from genetic and anatomical studies of lin-12 mutants that have either elevated or reduced levels of lin-12 activity. We report here the complete DNA sequence of lin-12: 13.5 kilobases (kb) derived from genomic clones and 4.5 kb from complementary DNA clones. It is of interest that the predicted product is a putative transmembrane protein, given that many of the decisions controlled by lin-12 activity require cell-cell interactions for the correct choice of cell fate. In addition, the predicted lin-12 product may be classified into several regions, based on amino acid sequence similarities to other proteins. These include extensive overall sequence similarity to the Drosophila Notch protein, which also is involved in cell-cell interactions that specify cell fate; a repeated motif found in proteins encoded by the yeast cell-cycle control genes cdc10 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and SWI6 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae); and a repeated motif exemplified by epidermal growth factor, found in many mammalian proteins.
The p63 gene, a homologue of the tumour-suppressor p53, is highly expressed in the basal or progenitor layers of many epithelial tissues. Here we report that mice homozygous for a disrupted p63 gene have major defects in their limb, craniofacial and epithelial development. p63 is expressed in the ectodermal surfaces of the limb buds, branchial arches and epidermal appendages, which are all sites of reciprocal signalling that direct morphogenetic patterning of the underlying mesoderm. The limb truncations are due to a failure to maintain the apical ectodermal ridge, a stratified epithelium, essential for limb development. The embryonic epidermis of p63-/- mice undergoes an unusual process of non-regenerative differentiation, culminating in a striking absence of all squamous epithelia and their derivatives, including mammary, lacrymal and salivary glands. Taken together, our results indicate that p63 is critical for maintaining the progenitor-cell populations that are necessary to sustain epithelial development and morphogenesis.
Chloride (Cl-) secretion by the airway epithelium regulates, in part, the quantity and composition of the respiratory tract fluid, thereby facilitating mucociliary clearance. The rate of Cl- secretion is controlled by apical membrane Cl- channels. Apical Cl- channels are opened and Cl- secretion is stimulated by a variety of hormones and neurotransmitters that increase intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). In cystic fibrosis (CF), a common lethal genetic disease of Caucasians, airway, sweat-gland duct, secretory-coil and possibly other epithelia are anion impermeable. This abnormality may explain several of the clinical manifestations of the disease. The Cl- impermeability in CF-airway epithelia has been localized to the apical cell membrane, where regulation of Cl- channels is abnormal: hormonal secretagogues stimulate cAMP accumulation appropriately but Cl- channels fail to open. Here we report that the purified catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase plus ATP opens Cl- channels in excised, cell-free patches of membrane from normal cells, but fails to open Cl- channels in CF cells. These results indicate that in normal cells, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates the Cl- channel or an associated regulatory protein, causing the channel to open. The failure of CF Cl- channels to open suggests a defect either in the channel or in such an associated regulatory protein.
The term 'biodiversity' is a simple contraction of 'biological diversity', and at first sight the concept is simple too: biodiversity is the sum total of all biotic variation from the level of genes to ecosystems. The challenge comes in measuring such a broad concept in ways that are useful. We show that, although biodiversity can never be fully captured by a single number, study of particular facets has led to rapid, exciting and sometimes alarming discoveries. Phylogenetic and temporal analyses are shedding light on the ecological and evolutionary processes that have shaped current biodiversity. There is no doubt that humans are now destroying this diversity at an alarming rate. A vital question now being tackled is how badly this loss affects ecosystem functioning. Although current research efforts are impressive, they are tiny in comparison to the amount of unknown diversity and the urgency and importance of the task.
Left ventricular mass (LVM) is a highly heritable trait and an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality. So far, genome-wide association studies have not identified the genetic factors that underlie LVM variation, and the regulatory mechanisms for blood-pressure-independent cardiac hypertrophy remain poorly understood. Unbiased systems genetics approaches in the rat now provide a powerful complementary tool to genome-wide association studies, and we applied integrative genomics to dissect a highly replicated, blood-pressure-independent LVM locus on rat chromosome 3p. Here we identified endonuclease G (Endog), which previously was implicated in apoptosis but not hypertrophy, as the gene at the locus, and we found a loss-of-function mutation in Endog that is associated with increased LVM and impaired cardiac function. Inhibition of Endog in cultured cardiomyocytes resulted in an increase in cell size and hypertrophic biomarkers in the absence of pro-hypertrophic stimulation. Genome-wide network analysis unexpectedly implicated ENDOG in fundamental mitochondrial processes that are unrelated to apoptosis. We showed direct regulation of ENDOG by ERR-a and PGC1a (which are master regulators of mitochondrial and cardiac function), interaction of ENDOG with the mitochondrial genome and ENDOG-mediated regulation of mitochondrial mass. At baseline, the Endog-deleted mouse heart had depleted mitochondria, mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, which were associated with enlarged and steatotic cardiomyocytes. Our study has further established the link between mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species and heart disease and has uncovered a role for Endog in maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy.
Studies of the sequence-specific binding of proteins to DNA have so far relied on in vitro experiments using cloned restriction fragments containing the relevant DNA sequences. We have applied the genomic sequencing technique of Church and Gilbert to show that the interactions observed in vitro occur in vivo. We use this approach to study the binding of regulatory proteins to the lac operon in vivo and detect changes in the reactivity (inhibition or enhancement) of guanines to methylation by dimethyl sulphate caused by the proximity of proteins to the N-7 atom of these guanines. We can detect the simultaneous binding of the catobolite gene activator protein (CAP) and the Lac repressor to their specific recognition sequences, and following induction of the lac operon we observe effects that are related to RNA polymerase binding or RNA elongation. We have successfully used oligonucleotide probes as short as 17 bases to display genomic sequence.
Translation elongation factors facilitate protein synthesis by the ribosome. Previous studies identified two universally conserved translation elongation factors, EF-Tu in bacteria (known as eEF1A in eukaryotes) and EF-G (eEF2), which deliver aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome and promote ribosomal translocation, respectively. The factor eIF5A (encoded by HYP2 and ANB1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the sole protein in eukaryotes and archaea to contain the unusual amino acid hypusine (N(epsilon)-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine), was originally identified based on its ability to stimulate the yield (endpoint) of methionyl-puromycin synthesis-a model assay for first peptide bond synthesis thought to report on certain aspects of translation initiation. Hypusine is required for eIF5A to associate with ribosomes and to stimulate methionyl-puromycin synthesis. Because eIF5A did not stimulate earlier steps of translation initiation, and depletion of eIF5A in yeast only modestly impaired protein synthesis, it was proposed that eIF5A function was limited to stimulating synthesis of the first peptide bond or that eIF5A functioned on only a subset of cellular messenger RNAs. However, the precise cellular role of eIF5A is unknown, and the protein has also been linked to mRNA decay, including the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, and to nucleocytoplasmic transport. Here we use molecular genetic and biochemical studies to show that eIF5A promotes translation elongation. Depletion or inactivation of eIF5A in the yeast S. cerevisiae resulted in the accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times. Addition of recombinant eIF5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover, inactivation of eIF5A mimicked the effects of the eEF2 inhibitor sordarin, indicating that eIF5A might function together with eEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Because eIF5A is a structural homologue of the bacterial protein EF-P, we propose that eIF5A/EF-P is a universally conserved translation elongation factor.
In the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the c-abl gene on chromosome 9 is translocated to bcr on chromosome 22. This results in the expression of a chimeric bcr-abl message that encodes the P210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase. The cells of 10% of acute lymphocytic leukemia patients (ALL) carry a cytogenetically similar Ph1 translocation. We report that Ph1-positive ALL cells express unique abl-derived tyrosine kinases of 185 and 180 kilodaltons that are distinct from the bcr-abl-derived P210 protein of CML. The appearance of the 185/180-kilodalton proteins correlates with the expression of a novel 6.5-kilobase messenger RNA. Thus, similar genetic translocations in two different leukemias result in the expression of distinct c-abl-derived products.
Many tyrosine kinases, including the receptors for hormones such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor and insulin, transmit intracellular signals through Ras proteins. Ligand binding to such receptors stimulates Ras guanine-nucleotide-exchange activity and increases the level of GTP-bound Ras, suggesting that these tyrosine kinases may activate a guanine-nucleotide releasing protein (GNRP). In Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, genetic studies have shown that Ras activation by tyrosine kinases requires the protein Sem-5/drk, which contains a single Src-homology (SH) 2 domain and two flanking SH3 domains. Sem-5 is homologous to the mammalian protein Grb2, which binds the autophosphorylated EGF receptor and other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins such as Shc through its SH2 domain. Here we show that in rodent fibroblasts, the SH3 domains of Grb2 are bound to the proline-rich carboxy-terminal tail of mSos1, a protein homologous to Drosophila Sos. Sos is required for Ras signalling and contains a central domain related to known Ras-GNRPs. EGF stimulation induces binding of the Grb2-mSos1 complex to the autophosphorylated EGF receptor, and mSos1 phosphorylation. Grb2 therefore appears to link tyrosine kinases to a Ras-GNRP in mammalian cells.
According to the prion hypothesis, atypical phenotypes arise when a prion protein adopts an alternative conformation and persist when that form assembles into self-replicating aggregates. Amyloid formation in vitro provides a model for this protein-misfolding pathway, but the mechanism by which this process interacts with the cellular environment to produce transmissible phenotypes is poorly understood. Using the yeast prion Sup35/[PSI(+)], we found that protein conformation determined the size distribution of aggregates through its interactions with a molecular chaperone. Shifts in this range created variations in aggregate abundance among cells because of a size threshold for transmission, and this heterogeneity, along with aggregate growth and fragmentation, induced age-dependent fluctuations in phenotype. Thus, prion conformations may specify phenotypes as population averages in a dynamic system.
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.1). PKU is a common inborn error of amino-acid metabolism in caucasian populations and approximately 1 in 50 individuals are carriers of a PKU allele. To define the molecular basis of PKU, we characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes of the PAH locus in the northern European population and observed that 90% of the PKU alleles in this population are confined to four common RFLP haplotypes. We have recently reported a splicing mutation in the PAH gene that is associated with RFLP haplotype 3 which is present at about 40% of mutant alleles. We now report the molecular lesion associated with the RFLP haplotype 2 mutant allele. This defect is caused by a C-to-T transition in exon 12 resulting in an amino-acid substitution (Arg to Trp) at residue 408 of PAH. Direct hybridization analysis of the point mutation using a specific oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that this mutation is also in linkage disequilibrium with RFLP haplotype 2 alleles that make up about 20% of mutant PAH genes.
Bphs controls Bordetella pertussis toxin (PTX)-induced vasoactive amine sensitization elicited by histamine (VAASH) and has an established role in autoimmunity. We report that congenic mapping links Bphs to the histamine H1 receptor gene (Hrh1/H1R) and that H1R differs at three amino acid residues in VAASH-susceptible and -resistant mice. Hrh1-/- mice are protected from VAASH, which can be restored by genetic complementation with a susceptible Bphs/Hrh1 allele, and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and autoimmune orchitis due to immune deviation. Thus, natural alleles of Hrh1 control both the autoimmune T cell and vascular responses regulated by histamine after PTX sensitization.
A novel peptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), has been predicted to result from alternative processing of the primary RNA transcript of the calcitonin gene in the rat. Several lines of evidence suggest that CGRP is a transmitter in the central and peripheral nervous system. Human CGRP has been isolated and characterized, and shown to have potent effects on the heart. The observations presented here indicate that human and rat CGRP also have potent effects on blood vessels. Intradermal injection of CGRP in femtomole doses induces microvascular dilatation resulting in increased blood flow, which we have detected in the rabbit by using a 133Xe clearance technique. In human skin, CGRP induces persistent local reddening. Microscopic observation of the hamster cheek pouch in vivo revealed that topical application of CGRP induces dilatation of arterioles. Furthermore, CGRP relaxes strips of rat aorta in vitro by an endothelial cell-dependent mechanism. Therefore, we suggest that local extravascular release of CGRP may be involved in the physiological control of blood flow and that circulating CGRP may contribute to hyperaemia in certain pathological conditions.
During mitosis, adherent animal cells undergo a drastic shape change, from essentially flat to round. Mitotic cell rounding is thought to facilitate organization within the mitotic cell and be necessary for the geometric requirements of division. However, the forces that drive this shape change remain poorly understood in the presence of external impediments, such as a tissue environment. Here we use cantilevers to track cell rounding force and volume. We show that cells have an outward rounding force, which increases as cells enter mitosis. We find that this mitotic rounding force depends both on the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the cells' ability to regulate osmolarity. The rounding force itself is generated by an osmotic pressure. However, the actomyosin cortex is required to maintain this rounding force against external impediments. Instantaneous disruption of the actomyosin cortex leads to volume increase, and stimulation of actomyosin contraction leads to volume decrease. These results show that in cells, osmotic pressure is balanced by inwardly directed actomyosin cortex contraction. Thus, by locally modulating actomyosin-cortex-dependent surface tension and globally regulating osmotic pressure, cells can control their volume, shape and mechanical properties.
The T/t complex is an extensive genetic region proximal to the H-2 complex on mouse chromosome 17, with multiple effects on embryonic development, spermatogenesis and recombination. Recently, two-dimensional gel analysis of testicular cell proteins identified a gene within the T/t complex that codes for a major cell surface-associated protein, p63/6.9 (ref. 4). The wild-type gene, Tcp-1b, codes for a 63,000-molecular weight protein (p63/6.9b), whereas a mutant allele, Tcp-1a, which occurs in all intact t haplotypes, codes for a more acidic form of the protein (p63/6.9a). Analysis of partial t haplotypes obtained from rare recombination events showed that Tcp-1a correlated completely with the tail interaction factor tT, which is thought to be a genetic allele of T, thus raising the possibility that the locus of T codes for the p63/6.9 protein. We report here that the p63/6.9 proteins produced by seven chromosomes carrying independently derived dominant mutations at the locus of T are all indistinguishable from the wild-type form; thus, the cumulative data indicate that the Tcp-1 gene is most probably not at the locus of T.
The study of human genetic disorders and mutant mouse models has provided evidence that genome maintenance mechanisms, DNA damage signalling and metabolic regulation cooperate to drive the ageing process. In particular, age-associated telomere damage, diminution of telomere 'capping' function and associated p53 activation have emerged as prime instigators of a functional decline of tissue stem cells and of mitochondrial dysfunction that adversely affect renewal and bioenergetic support in diverse tissues. Constructing a model of how telomeres, stem cells and mitochondria interact with key molecules governing genome integrity, 'stemness' and metabolism provides a framework for how diverse factors contribute to ageing and age-related disorders.
Large blue (Maculinea) butterflies are highly endangered throughout the Palaearctic region, and have been the focus of intense conservation research. In addition, their extraordinary parasitic lifestyles make them ideal for studies of life history evolution. Early instars consume flower buds of specific host plants, but later instars live in ant nests where they either devour the brood (predators), or are fed mouth-to-mouth by the adult ants (cuckoos). Here we present the phylogeny for the group, which shows that it is a monophyletic clade nested within Phengaris, a rare Oriental genus whose species have similar life histories. Cuckoo species are likely to have evolved from predatory ancestors. As early as five million years ago, two Maculinea clades diverged, leading to the different parasitic strategies seen in the genus today. Contrary to current belief, the two recognized cuckoo species show little genetic divergence and are probably a single ecologically differentiated species. On the other hand, some of the predatory morphospecies exhibit considerable genetic divergence and may contain cryptic species. These findings have important implications for conservation and reintroduction efforts.
Inositol trisphosphate is a second messenger that controls many cellular processes by generating internal calcium signals. It operates through receptors whose molecular and physiological properties closely resemble the calcium-mobilizing ryanodine receptors of muscle. This family of intracellular calcium channels displays the regenerative process of calcium-induced calcium release responsible for the complex spatiotemporal patterns of calcium waves and oscillations. Such a dynamic signalling pathway controls many cellular processes, including fertilization, cell growth, transformation, secretion, smooth muscle contraction, sensory perception and neuronal signalling.
Natural rewards and drugs of abuse can alter dopamine signaling, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons are known to fire action potentials tonically or phasically under different behavioral conditions. However, without technology to control specific neurons with appropriate temporal precision in freely behaving mammals, the causal role of these action potential patterns in driving behavioral changes has been unclear. We used optogenetic tools to selectively stimulate VTA dopaminergic neuron action potential firing in freely behaving mammals. We found that phasic activation of these neurons was sufficient to drive behavioral conditioning and elicited dopamine transients with magnitudes not achieved by longer, lower-frequency spiking. These results demonstrate that phasic dopaminergic activity is sufficient to mediate mammalian behavioral conditioning.
Chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by fusion of the bcr and abl genes on chromosomes 22 and 9, respectively. In most cases, the fusion involves a reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), which produces the cytogenetically distinctive Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). Fusion can be detected by Southern (DNA) analysis or by in vitro amplification of the messenger RNA from the fusion gene with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques are sensitive but cannot be applied to single cells. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used with probes from portions of the bcr and abl genes to detect the bcr-abl fusion in individual blood and bone marrow cells from six patients. The fusion event was detected in all samples analyzed, of which three were cytogenetically Ph1-negative. One of the Ph1-negative samples was also PCR-negative. This approach is fast and sensitive, and provides potential for determining the frequency of the abnormality in different cell lineages.
Telomeres confer stability on chromosomes by protecting them from degradation and recombination and by allowing complete replication of the end. They are genetically important as they define the ends of the linkage map. Telomeres of lower eukaryotes contain short repeats consisting of a G-rich and a C-rich strand, the G-rich strand running 5'-3' towards the telomere and extending at the end. Telomeres of human chromosomes share characteristics with those of lower eukaryotes including sequence similarity as detected by cross-hybridization. Telomeric repeats from many organisms can provide telomere function in yeast. Here we describe a modified yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vector with only one telomere which we used to clone human telomeres by complementation in yeast. YACs containing human telomeres were identified by hydridization to an oligonucleotide of the trypanosome telomeric repeat. A subcloned human fragment from one such YAC is immediately subtelomeric on at least one human chromosome.
Throughout the animal kingdom the innate nature of basic behaviour routines suggests that the underlying neuronal substrates necessary for their execution are genetically determined and developmentally programmed. Complex innate behaviours require proper timing and ordering of individual component behaviours. In Drosophila melanogaster, analyses of combinations of mutations of the fruitless (fru) gene have shown that male-specific isoforms (Fru(M)) of the Fru transcription factor are necessary for proper execution of all steps of the innate courtship ritual. Here, we eliminate Fru(M) expression in one group of about 60 neurons in the Drosophila central nervous system and observe severely contracted courtship behaviour, including rapid courtship initiation, absence of orienting and tapping, and the simultaneous occurrence of wing vibration, licking and attempted copulation. Our results identify a small group of median bundle neurons, that in wild-type Drosophila appropriately trigger the sequential execution of the component behaviours that constitute the Drosophila courtship ritual.
Nucleotide sequence and deletion analysis have been used to identify the regulatory and coding sequences comprising the cholera toxin operon (ctx). Incorporation of defined in vitro-generated ctx deletion mutations into Vibrio cholerae by in vivo genetic recombination produced strains which have practical value in cholera vaccine development.
Cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) complexes are essential activators of cell cycle progression in all eukaryotes. In contrast to mammalian cells, in which multiple cdk's contribute to cell cycle regulation, the yeast cell cycle is largely controlled by the activity of a single cdk, CDC28. Analysis of the putative G1 cyclin PCL2 (ORFD) identified a second cyclin-cdk complex that contributes to cell cycle progression in yeast. PCL2 interacted with the cdk PHO85 in vivo and in vitro and formed a kinase complex that had G1-periodic activity. Under genetic conditions in which the Start transition was compromised, PHO85 and its associated cyclin subunits were essential for cell cycle commitment. Because PHO85 and another cyclin-like molecule, PHO80, also take part in inorganic phosphate metabolism, this cdk enzyme may integrate responses to nutritional conditions with the cell cycle.
DNA was extracted from the fossil termite Mastotermes electrodominicus preserved in Oligo-Miocene amber (25 million to 30 million years old). Fragments of mitochondrial [16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)] and nuclear (18S rDNA) genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis of fossil and extant 18S rDNA confirmed morphological cladistic analyses of living dictyopterans (termites, cockroaches, and mantids). The fossil termite shares several sequence attributes with Mastotermes darwiniensis. Addition of this fossil to living-species phylogeny is required to substantiate Mastotermes monophyly and affects molecular phylogenetic hypotheses of termites in this, the oldest DNA yet characterized.
The nitrogen fixation (nif) genes of Klebsiella pneumoniae are specifically regulated by the products of the nifLA operon. We have located the promoter of this operon, and identified sequences required for nifLA transcription. Transcription from this promoter is shown to be positively regulated by the ntrC gene product (which coordinates the expression of many operons required for nitrogen assimilation) and also autogenously by the product of the nifA gene.
Unequal sister chromatid exchanges occur at the ribosomal DNA locus of yeast during mitotic growth. The frequency of unequal crossing over, as measured by the deletion or duplication of an inserted genetic marker (LEU2), is sufficient to maintain the sequence homogeneity of the rDNA repeat units.
Mechanotransduction refers to the transformation of physical forces into chemical signals. It generally involves stretch-sensitive channels or conformational change of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. Mechanotransduction is crucial for the physiology of several organs and for cell migration. The extent to which mechanical inputs contribute to development, and how they do this, remains poorly defined. Here we show that a mechanotransduction pathway operates between the body-wall muscles of Caenorhabditis elegans and the epidermis. This pathway involves, in addition to a Rac GTPase, three signalling proteins found at the hemidesmosome: p21-activated kinase (PAK-1), the adaptor GIT-1 and its partner PIX-1. The phosphorylation of intermediate filaments is one output of this pathway. Tension exerted by adjacent muscles or externally exerted mechanical pressure maintains GIT-1 at hemidesmosomes and stimulates PAK-1 activity through PIX-1 and Rac. This pathway promotes the maturation of a hemidesmosome into a junction that can resist mechanical stress and contributes to coordinating the morphogenesis of epidermal and muscle tissues. Our findings suggest that the C. elegans hemidesmosome is not only an attachment structure, but also a mechanosensor that responds to tension by triggering signalling processes. We suggest that similar pathways could promote epithelial morphogenesis or wound healing in other organisms in which epithelial cells adhere to tension-generating contractile cells.
Certain single base substitutions causing genetic diseases or resulting in polymorphisms linked to mutant alleles, alter a restriction enzyme cleavage site and can therefore be detected in total genomic DNA using DNA blots. Many base substitutions do not lead to an altered restriction site, but these can be detected using synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes if the DNA sequence surrounding the base substitution is known. In the case of beta-thalassaemia, where 22 different single base mutations have been identified, a large number of probes would be required for diagnosis. An approach which was used to detect mutations in viral DNA involves the S1 nuclease treatment of heteroduplexes formed between wild-type and mutant DNA. Although certain single base mismatches are cleaved by S1 nuclease (ref. 11 and T. Shenk, personal communication), many other mismatches examined by this procedure are not cleaved (B. Seed, personal communication; R.M.M., unpublished data). Heteroduplexes between mutant and wild-type subgenomic fragments of double-stranded reovirus RNA migrate slower than the corresponding homoduplexes in polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea, but it is not known whether this method is applicable to DNA heteroduplexes containing single base mismatches. Here we describe a procedure that involves the electrophoretic separation of DNA heteroduplexes in a well-characterized gel system. We show that four different human beta-thalassaemia alleles with known single base mutations can be detected with as little as 5 micrograms of total genomic DNA. The method should be useful in the localization and diagnosis of mutations associated with genetic diseases.
In summary, then, we would like to suggest that in broad investigations of the patterns of interaction and relationship among organisms the artificial and stultifying fragmentation of population biology into divisions such as taxonomy, population genetics, and ecology should be ignored. Care also should be taken to scrutinize current concepts such as "species," "niche," and "community." If some emergent patterns seem to correspond to a great degree with these concepts, then the concepts may be given operational definitions and the labels should be retained. If there is no such correspondence, then the concepts will have outlived their usefulness and should be discarded. The basic units of population biology are not communities, species, or even populations, but individual organisms (32). In populations, variation, growth, genetic equilibria, selection, behavior, and so on are not "things" but relationships. Therefore, what is of interes in population biology is the pattern in which organisms are related in space and time (33).
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent type of variation in the human genome, and they provide powerful tools for a variety of medical genetic studies. In a large-scale survey for SNPs, 2.3 megabases of human genomic DNA was examined by a combination of gel-based sequencing and high-density variation-detection DNA chips. A total of 3241 candidate SNPs were identified. A genetic map was constructed showing the location of 2227 of these SNPs. Prototype genotyping chips were developed that allow simultaneous genotyping of 500 SNPs. The results provide a characterization of human diversity at the nucleotide level and demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale identification of human SNPs.
Surviving persons from a kindred in which retinoblastoma occurred over four generations, transmitted by eight unaffected individuals, underwent chromosomal analysis. The results revealed that the development of retinoblastoma was associated with a constitutional chromosome deletion del(13)(q13.1q14.5) and that the unaffected transmitting state was associated with a balanced insertional translocation. These findings indicate that predisposition to retinoblastoma may be attributed to the loss of specific genetic material and that a chromosomal mechanism may explain apparent lack of gene penetrance in certain families. The development of unilateral, and not bilateral, retinoblastoma suggests either that the chromosome deletion is different from the mutation of heritable retinoblastoma in general, or that the chromosome deletion lessens the probability of subsequent somatic carcinogenic events.
We have the human genome sequence. It is freely available, accurate and nearly complete. But is the genome ready for medicine? The new resource is already changing genetic research strategies to find information of medical value. Now we need high-quality annotation of all the functionally important sequences and the variations within them that contribute to health and disease. To achieve this, we need more genome sequences, systematic experimental analyses, and extensive information on human phenotypes. Flexible and user-friendly access to well-annotated genomes will create an environment for innovation, and the potential for unlimited use of sequencing in biomedical research and practice.
Schizophrenia is a common disorder with a life time prevalence of approximately 1 per cent. The illness often develops in young adults, who were previously normal, and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms including hallucinations and delusions (psychotic symptoms) and symptoms such as severely inappropriate emotional responses, a disorder of thinking and concentration, erratic behaviour as well as social and occupational deterioration. A considerable proportion of the variance in the liability to develop schizophrenia may be genetic, but segregation analysis, to establish a mode of transmission, has not produced a consistent result. One of these studies was carried out in Iceland and made use of the large family size and extensive geneaological information present in that country. Here we demonstrate genetic linkage of two DNA polymorphisms on the long arm of human chromosome 5 to schizophrenia in seven British and Icelandic families with multiple affected members. The results indicate the existence of a gene locus with a dominant schizophrenia-susceptibility allele. Inheritance of the allele in the families studied suggests that it may also predispose to psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders and a variety of other disorders. This report provides the first strong evidence for the involvement of a single gene in the causation of schizophrenia.
To examine the extent and variation of allelic loss in a common adult tumor, polymorphic DNA markers were studied from every nonacrocentric autosomal arm in 56 paired colorectal carcinoma and adjacent normal colonic mucosa specimens. This analysis was termed an allelotype, in analogy with a karyotype. Three major conclusions were drawn from this analysis: (i) Allelic deletions were remarkably common; one of the alleles of each polymorphic marker tested was lost in at least some tumors, and some tumors lost more than half of their parental alleles. (ii) In addition to allelic deletions, new DNA fragments not present in normal tissue were identified in five carcinomas; these new fragments contained repeated sequences of the variable number of tandem repeat type. (iii) Patients with more than the median percentage of allelic deletions had a considerably worse prognosis than did the other patients, although the size and stage of the primary tumors were very similar in the two groups. In addition to its implications concerning the genetic events underlying tumorigenesis, tumor allelotype may provide a molecular tool for improved estimation of prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.
Infections by the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses cause a rapidly fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans for which no approved antivirals are available. Filovirus entry is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein (GP), which attaches viral particles to the cell surface, delivers them to endosomes and catalyses fusion between viral and endosomal membranes. Additional host factors in the endosomal compartment are probably required for viral membrane fusion; however, despite considerable efforts, these critical host factors have defied molecular identification. Here we describe a genome-wide haploid genetic screen in human cells to identify host factors required for Ebola virus entry. Our screen uncovered 67 mutations disrupting all six members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein-sorting (HOPS) multisubunit tethering complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosomes to lysosomes, and 39 independent mutations that disrupt the endo/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). Cells defective for the HOPS complex or NPC1 function, including primary fibroblasts derived from human Niemann-Pick type C1 disease patients, are resistant to infection by Ebola virus and Marburg virus, but remain fully susceptible to a suite of unrelated viruses. We show that membrane fusion mediated by filovirus glycoproteins and viral escape from the vesicular compartment require the NPC1 protein, independent of its known function in cholesterol transport. Our findings uncover unique features of the entry pathway used by filoviruses and indicate potential antiviral strategies to combat these deadly agents.
The developmental and genetic bases for the formation, plasticity and diversity of eyespot patterns in butterflies are examined. Eyespot pattern mutants, regulatory gene expression, and transplants of the eyespot developmental organizer demonstrate that eyespot position, number, size and colour are determined progressively in a developmental pathway largely uncoupled from those regulating other wing-pattern elements and body structures. Species comparisons and selection experiments suggest that the evolution of eyespot patterns can occur rapidly through modulation of different stages of this pathway, and requires only single, or very few, changes in regulatory genes.
The achondroplasia class of chondrodysplasias comprises the most common genetic forms of dwarfism in humans and includes achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia types I and II (TDI and TDII), which are caused by different mutations in a fibroblast growth-factor receptor FGFR3 (ref. 1). The molecular mechanism and the mediators of these FGFR3-related growth abnormalities are not known. Here we show that mutant TDII FGFR3 has a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity which can specifically activate the transcription factor Stat1 (for signal transducer and activator of transcription). Furthermore, expression of TDII FGFR3 induced nuclear translocation of Stat1, expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1), and growth arrest of the cell. Thus, TDII FGFR3 may use Stat1 as a mediator of growth retardation in bone development. Consistent with this, Stat1 activation and increased p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression was found in the cartilage cells from the TDII fetus, but not in those from the normal fetus. Thus, abnormal STAT activation and p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression by the TDII mutant receptor may be responsible for this FGFR3-related bone disease.
The genetics of renal cancer is dominated by inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene in clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the commonest histological subtype. A recent large-scale screen of ~3,500 genes by PCR-based exon re-sequencing identified several new cancer genes in ccRCC including UTX (also known as KDM6A), JARID1C (also known as KDM5C) and SETD2 (ref. 2). These genes encode enzymes that demethylate (UTX, JARID1C) or methylate (SETD2) key lysine residues of histone H3. Modification of the methylation state of these lysine residues of histone H3 regulates chromatin structure and is implicated in transcriptional control. However, together these mutations are present in fewer than 15% of ccRCC, suggesting the existence of additional, currently unidentified cancer genes. Here, we have sequenced the protein coding exome in a series of primary ccRCC and report the identification of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex gene PBRM1 (ref. 4) as a second major ccRCC cancer gene, with truncating mutations in 41% (92/227) of cases. These data further elucidate the somatic genetic architecture of ccRCC and emphasize the marked contribution of aberrant chromatin biology.
The myoD family of DNA binding proteins has been implicated in the control of myogenesis in a variety of organisms. Searches for homologs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans yielded only one gene, designated hlh-1, expressed in body-wall muscle cells and their precursors. To assess the role of hlh-1 in C. elegans myogenesis, genetic deficiencies spanning the hlh-1 locus were isolated after gamma irradiation. Embryos homozygous for these deficiencies exhibited extensive body-wall muscle differentiation, including expression of several characteristic myofilament proteins and weak contracile behavior. Thus, zygotic hlh-1 expression was not required for body-wall muscle precursors to adopt muscle cell fates.
Histone methylation is crucial for regulating chromatin structure, gene transcription and the epigenetic state of the cell. LSD1 is a lysine-specific histone demethylase that represses transcription by demethylating histone H3 on lysine 4 (ref. 1). The LSD1 complex contains a number of proteins, all of which have been assigned roles in events upstream of LSD1-mediated demethylation apart from BHC80 (also known as PHF21A), a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger-containing protein. Here we report that, in contrast to the PHD fingers of the bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF) and inhibitor of growth family 2 (ING2), which bind methylated H3K4 (H3K4me3), the PHD finger of BHC80 binds unmethylated H3K4 (H3K4me0), and this interaction is specifically abrogated by methylation of H3K4. The crystal structure of the PHD finger of BHC80 bound to an unmodified H3 peptide has revealed the structural basis of the recognition of H3K4me0. Knockdown of BHC80 by RNA inhibition results in the de-repression of LSD1 target genes, and this repression is restored by the reintroduction of wild-type BHC80 but not by a PHD-finger mutant that cannot bind H3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that BHC80 and LSD1 depend reciprocally on one another to associate with chromatin. These findings couple the function of BHC80 to that of LSD1, and indicate that unmodified H3K4 is part of the 'histone code'. They further raise the possibility that the generation and recognition of the unmodified state on histone tails in general might be just as crucial as post-translational modifications of histone for chromatin and transcriptional regulation.
Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying natural variation in gene expression is a central goal of both medical and evolutionary genetics, and studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have become an important tool for achieving this goal. Although all eQTL studies so far have assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International HapMap Project. By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the HapMap project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that eQTLs near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.
Mouse somatic cells lacking thymidine kinase were mixed in culture with human diploid cells lacking hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, and hybrid cells were isolated and maintained in a selective medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine. The hybrid cells at the time of isolation had karyotypes consisting predominantly of mouse chromosomes but with one human chromosome, a submetacentric member of group E, apparently giving thymidine kinase to the hybrid cell. However, after long-term propagation in the selective medium this chromosome has been lost, although cells continue to show thymidine kinase activity as demonstrated by the incorporation of (3)H-thy-midine into DNA in the hybrid cell. The hybrid cells have only mouse electro-phoretic variants for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, suggesting that the human genetic loci for these enzymes are not represented in the hybrid genome and may be unlinked to that for thymidine kinase.
Nearly 70% of the 535 species of salamanders in the world are members of a single family, the Plethodontidae, or lungless salamanders. The centre of diversity for this clade is North and Middle America, where the vast majority (99%) of species are found. We report the discovery of the first Asian plethodontid salamander, from montane woodlands in southwestern Korea. The new species superficially resembles members of North American genera, in particular the morphologically conservative genus Plethodon. However, phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear encoded gene Rag-1 shows the new taxon to be widely divergent from Plethodon. The new salamander differs osteologically from putative relatives, especially with respect to the tongue (attached protrusible) and the derived tarsus. We place the species in a new genus on the basis of the morphological and molecular data. The distribution of the new salamander adds to the enigma of Old World plethodontids, which are otherwise restricted to the western Mediterranean region, suggesting a more extensive past distribution of the family.
Mammalian meiotic recombination, which preferentially occurs at specialized sites called hotspots, ensures the orderly segregation of meiotic chromosomes and creates genetic variation among offspring. A locus on mouse chromosome 17, which controls activation of recombination at multiple distant hotspots, has been mapped within a 181-kilobase interval, three of whose genes can be eliminated as candidates. The remaining gene, Prdm9, codes for a zinc finger containing histone H3K4 trimethylase that is expressed in early meiosis and whose deficiency results in sterility in both sexes. Mus musculus exhibits five alleles of Prdm9; human populations exhibit two predominant alleles and multiple minor alleles. The identification of Prdm9 as a protein regulating mammalian recombination hotspots initiates molecular studies of this important biological control system.
The use of X-ray-induced mitotic recombination to genetically mark individual cells and their descendants during development has led to the discovery of lineage restriction boundaries in Drosophila imaginal disks, dividing the disks into areas called compartments. Clones of cells initiated after a given developmental stage are unable to grow across these boundaries, even if provided with a growth rate advantage over the remaining cells. It has been suggested that cells within compartments are distinguished by the differential activation of selector genes and that the lineage restrictions are maintained by adhesivity differences between the cells in different compartments, but other mechanisms have not been ruled out. Recently a discrete population of cells with unusual permeability properties has been described along an intersegmental lineage restriction boundary in Oncopeltus, suggesting that a lineage restriction could be maintained by a zone of cells which present a barrier to clone growth. Here we demonstrate by autoradiography the presence of a narrow zone of non-proliferating cells (ZNC) coincident with the presumptive wing margin in the Drosophila wing disk, and suggest that this could account for the observed lineage restriction between presumptive dorsal and ventral surfaces of the wing. As the anterior/posterior compartment boundary does not coincide with a ZNC, the results indicate that different lineage boundaries may be maintained by different mechanisms.
The oncogene of the human EJ bladder carcinoma cell lines arose via alteration of a cellular proto-oncogene. Experiments are presented that localize the genetic lesion that led to activation of the oncogene. The lesion has no affect on levels of expression of the oncogene. Instead, it affects the structure of the oncogene-encoded protein.
The fragile site at Xq27, associated with a common form of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), is expressed in a variable proportion of the peripheral lymphocytes of affected males when the cells are cultured under thymidylate stress (Td stress) produced by folate or thymidylate deprivation. Some clinically normal males--transmitting males--are known to carry and transmit the fragile X mutation and yet show no cytogenetic expression in lymphocytes. Normal males with no family history of X-linked mental retardation express the site only rarely. When the fragile X chromosome from affected males is isolated in a rodent genetic background by somatic cell hybridization, the level of expression is similar to that seen in lymphocytes under Td stress. Here we show that X chromosomes from two transmitting males and two normal control males, all of which were fragile X negative in lymphocytes or lymphoblasts, could be made to express the fragile site in hybrids, although at levels that were below those seen in hybrids from affected males. Furthermore, transmitting males could be differentiated from normal males by their significantly higher expression rates when hybrids were exposed to caffeine before cytogenetic harvest. One male chimpanzee also showed low level expression in hybrid cells. These data suggest that the hybrid system lowers the threshold for fragile X expression, a fragile site at Xq27 may be present on all human and chimpanzee X chromosomes and constitutes a previously unrecognized common fragile site and the hybrid system with caffeine post-treatment can distinguish between the common Xq27 fragile site of control males, the occult mutant fragile site of a transmitting male, and the fully expressed fragile site of an affected male with XLMR. Thus the mutation producing XLMR may represent a multi-step alteration of a naturally occurring DNA sequence producing a continuum of cytogenetic expression and a threshold for clinical manifestation.
At the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the prion protein (PrP) can be synthesized in several topological forms. The role of these different forms was explored with transgenic mice expressing PrP mutations that alter the relative ratios of the topological forms. Expression of a particular transmembrane form (termed CtmPrP) produced neurodegenerative changes in mice similar to those of some genetic prion diseases. Brains from these mice contained CtmPrP but not PrPSc, the PrP isoform responsible for transmission of prion diseases. Furthermore, in one heritable prion disease of humans, brain tissue contained CtmPrP but not PrPSc. Thus, aberrant regulation of protein biogenesis and topology at the endoplasmic reticulum can result in neurodegeneration.
The isotopic compositions of lead and the concentrations lead, uranium, and thorium in samples of oceanic tholeiite and alkali suites are determined, and the genetic relations of the oceanic basalts are discussed. Lead of the oceanic tholeiites has a varying lead-206: lead-204 ratio between 17.8 and 18.8, while leads of the alkali basalt suites from Easter Island and Guadalupe Island are very radiogenic with lead-206: lead-204 ratios between 19.3 and 20.4 It is concluded that (i) the isotopic composition of lead in oceanic tholeiite suggests that the upper mantle source region of the tholeiite was differentiated from and original mantle material more than 1 billion years ago and that the upper mantle is not homogeneous at the present time, (ii) less than 20 million years was required for the crystal differentiation within the alkali suite from Easter Island, (iii) no crustal contamination was involved in the course of differentiation of rocks from Easter Island; however, some crustal contamination may have affected Guadalupe Island rocks, and (iv) alkali basalt may be produced from the tholeiite in the oceanic region by crystal differentiation. Alternatively the difference in the isotopic composition of lead in oceanic basalts may be produced by partial melting at different depths of a differentiated upper mantle.
Lake Victoria harbors a unique species-rich flock of more than 500 endemic haplochromine cichlid fishes. The origin, age, and mechanism of diversification of this extraordinary radiation are still debated. Geological evidence suggests that the lake dried out completely about 14,700 years ago. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses of almost 300 DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region of East African cichlids, we find that the Lake Victoria cichlid flock is derived from the geologically older Lake Kivu. We suggest that the two seeding lineages may have already been lake-adapted when they colonized Lake Victoria. A haplotype analysis further shows that the most recent desiccation of Lake Victoria did not lead to a complete extinction of its endemic cichlid fauna and that the major lineage diversification took place about 100,000 years ago.
Previous studies have emphasized that genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is rare and is expressed primarily as premenopausal breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, or both. Proliferative breast disease (PBD) is a significant risk factor for the development of breast cancer and appears to be a precursor lesion. PBD and breast cancer were studied in 103 women from 20 kindreds that were selected for the presence of two first degree relatives with breast cancer and in 31 control women. Physical examination, screening mammography, and four-quadrant fine-needle breast aspirates were performed. Cytologic analysis of breast aspirates revealed PBD in 35% of clinically normal female first degree relatives of breast cancer cases and in 13% of controls. Genetic analysis suggests that genetic susceptibility causes both PBD and breast cancer in these kindreds. This study supports the hypothesis that this susceptibility is responsible for a considerable portion of breast cancer, including unilateral and postmenopausal breast cancer.
The reprogramming of X-chromosome inactivation during the acquisition of pluripotency in vivo and in vitro is accompanied by the repression of Xist, the trigger of X-inactivation, and the upregulation of its antisense counterpart Tsix. We have shown that key factors supporting pluripotency-Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2-bind within Xist intron 1 in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESC) to repress Xist transcription. However, the relationship between transcription factors of the pluripotency network and Tsix regulation has remained unclear. Here we show that Tsix upregulation in embryonic stem cells depends on the recruitment of the pluripotent marker Rex1, and of the reprogramming-associated factors Klf4 and c-Myc, by the DXPas34 minisatellite associated with the Tsix promoter. Upon deletion of DXPas34, binding of the three factors is abrogated and the transcriptional machinery is no longer efficiently recruited to the Tsix promoter. Additional analyses including knockdown experiments further demonstrate that Rex1 is critically important for efficient transcription elongation of Tsix. Hence, distinct embryonic-stem-cell-specific complexes couple X-inactivation reprogramming and pluripotency, with Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 repressing Xist to facilitate the reactivation of the inactive X, and Klf4, c-Myc and Rex1 activating Tsix to remodel Xist chromatin and ensure random X-inactivation upon differentiation. The holistic pattern of Xist/Tsix regulation by pluripotent factors that we have identified suggests a general direct governance of complex epigenetic processes by the machinery dedicated to pluripotency.
With the discovery of RNA editing, a process whereby the primary sequence of RNA is altered after transcription, traditional concepts of genetic information transfer had to be revised. The known RNA editing systems act mainly on messenger RNAs, introducing sequence changes that alter their coding properties. An editing system that acts on transfer RNAs is described here. In the mitochondria of Acanthamoeba castellanii, an amoeboid protozoan, certain transfer RNAs differ in sequence from the genes that encode them. The changes consist of single-nucleotide conversions (U to A, U to G, and A to G) that appear to arise posttranscriptionally, are localized in the acceptor stem, and have the effect of correcting mismatched base pairs. Editing thus restores the base pairing expected of a normal transfer RNA in this region.
Myogenic potential, survival and expansion of mammalian muscle progenitors depend on the myogenic determinants Pax3 and Pax7 embryonically, and Pax7 alone perinatally. Several in vitro studies support the critical role of Pax7 in these functions of adult muscle stem cells (satellite cells), but a formal demonstration has been lacking in vivo. Here we show, through the application of inducible Cre/loxP lineage tracing and conditional gene inactivation to the tibialis anterior muscle regeneration paradigm, that, unexpectedly, when Pax7 is inactivated in adult mice, mutant satellite cells are not compromised in muscle regeneration, they can proliferate and reoccupy the sublaminal satellite niche, and they are able to support further regenerative processes. Dual adult inactivation of Pax3 and Pax7 also results in normal muscle regeneration. Multiple time points of gene inactivation reveal that Pax7 is only required up to the juvenile period when progenitor cells make the transition into quiescence. Furthermore, we demonstrate a cell-intrinsic difference between neonatal progenitor and adult satellite cells in their Pax7-dependency. Our finding of an age-dependent change in the genetic requirement for muscle stem cells cautions against inferring adult stem-cell biology from embryonic studies, and has direct implications for the use of stem cells from hosts of different ages in transplantation-based therapy.
Signaling pathways that mediate the normal functions of growth factors are commonly subverted in cancer. Oncogenes identified by a variety of approaches have been shown to function at critical steps in mitogenic signaling. Progression through the cell cycle requires the coordinated actions of members of two complementary classes of growth factors, and oncogenes appear to replace the actions of one set of these growth factors. Growth factors can also influence normal cell differentiation, and constitutive activation of growth-promoting pathways in cancer cells can modulate the cell phenotype as well. Paracrine actions of growth factors and cytokines may also influence the stepwise series of genetic events that lead to malignancy. New approaches for cancer therapy are being developed that intervene at various steps in growth factor signaling pathways.
DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.
Natural populations of guppies were subjected to an episode of directional selection that mimicked natural processes. The resulting rate of evolution of age and size at maturity was similar to rates typically obtained for traits subjected to artificial selection in laboratory settings and up to seven orders of magnitude greater than rates inferred from the paleontological record. Male traits evolved more rapidly than female traits largely because males had more genetic variation upon which natural selection could act. These results are considered in light of the ongoing debate about the importance of natural selection versus other processes in the paleontological record of evolution.
In nature, helical macromolecules such as collagen, chitin and cellulose are critical to the morphogenesis and functionality of various hierarchically structured materials. During tissue formation, these chiral macromolecules are secreted and undergo self-templating assembly, a process whereby multiple kinetic factors influence the assembly of the incoming building blocks to produce non-equilibrium structures. A single macromolecule can form diverse functional structures when self-templated under different conditions. Collagen type I, for instance, forms transparent corneal tissues from orthogonally aligned nematic fibres, distinctively coloured skin tissues from cholesteric phase fibre bundles, and mineralized tissues from hierarchically organized fibres. Nature's self-templated materials surpass the functional and structural complexity achievable by current top-down and bottom-up fabrication methods. However, self-templating has not been thoroughly explored for engineering synthetic materials. Here we demonstrate the biomimetic, self-templating assembly of chiral colloidal particles (M13 phage) into functional materials. A single-step process produces long-range-ordered, supramolecular films showing multiple levels of hierarchical organization and helical twist. Three distinct supramolecular structures are created by this approach: nematic orthogonal twists, cholesteric helical ribbons and smectic helicolidal nanofilaments. Both chiral liquid crystalline phase transitions and competing interfacial forces at the interface are found to be critical factors in determining the morphology of the templated structures during assembly. The resulting materials show distinctive optical and photonic properties, functioning as chiral reflector/filters and structural colour matrices. In addition, M13 phages with genetically incorporated bioactive peptide ligands direct both soft and hard tissue growth in a hierarchically organized manner. Our assembly approach provides insight into the complexities of hierarchical assembly in nature and could be expanded to other chiral molecules to engineer sophisticated functional helical-twisted structures.
Regulatory T cells engage in the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance by actively suppressing self-reactive lymphocytes. Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanism of their development. Here we show that Foxp3, which encodes a transcription factor that is genetically defective in an autoimmune and inflammatory syndrome in humans and mice, is specifically expressed in naturally arising CD4+ regulatory T cells. Furthermore, retroviral gene transfer of Foxp3 converts naive T cells toward a regulatory T cell phenotype similar to that of naturally occurring CD4+ regulatory T cells. Thus, Foxp3 is a key regulatory gene for the development of regulatory T cells.
Human tumours have a large degree of cellular and genetic heterogeneity. Complex cell interactions in the tumour and its microenvironment are thought to have an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Furthermore, cooperation between oncogenic genetic lesions is required for tumour development; however, it is not known how cell interactions contribute to oncogenic cooperation. The genetic techniques available in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster allow analysis of the behaviour of cells with distinct mutations, making this the ideal model organism with which to study cell interactions and oncogenic cooperation. In Drosophila eye-antennal discs, cooperation between the oncogenic protein Ras(V12) (ref. 5) and loss-of-function mutations in the conserved tumour suppressor scribbled (scrib) gives rise to metastatic tumours that display many characteristics observed in human cancers. Here we show that clones of cells bearing different mutations can cooperate to promote tumour growth and invasion in Drosophila. We found that the Ras(V12) and scrib(-) mutations can also cause tumours when they affect different adjacent epithelial cells. We show that this interaction between Ras(V12) and scrib(-) clones involves JNK signalling propagation and JNK-induced upregulation of JAK/STAT-activating cytokines, a compensatory growth mechanism for tissue homeostasis. The development of Ras(V12) tumours can also be triggered by tissue damage, a stress condition that activates JNK signalling. Given the conservation of the pathways examined here, similar cooperative mechanisms could have a role in the development of human cancers.
Aggression is regulated by pheromones in many animal species. However, in no system have aggression pheromones, their cognate receptors and corresponding sensory neurons been identified. Here we show that 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), a male-specific volatile pheromone, robustly promotes male-male aggression in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. The aggression-promoting effect of synthetic cVA requires olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the receptor Or67d, as well as the receptor itself. Activation of Or67d-expressing OSNs, either by genetic manipulation of their excitability or by exposure to male pheromones in the absence of other classes of OSNs, is sufficient to promote aggression. High densities of male flies can promote aggression by the release of volatile cVA. In turn, cVA-promoted aggression can promote male fly dispersal from a food resource, in a manner dependent on Or67d-expressing OSNs. These data indicate that cVA may mediate negative-feedback control of male population density, through its effect on aggression. Identification of a pheromone-OSN pair controlling aggression in a genetic organism opens the way to unravelling the neurobiology of this evolutionarily conserved behaviour.
An unexpected immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, signal sequence replacement, was observed in which the recombinational signal sequences of a VH gene segment are fused intact to the 5' end of a DJH element. Nucleotides are not lost from the signal sequences, but they may be lost from the DJH coding sequence. Signal sequence replacement may result from the alternative resolution of an intermediate in VH-to-DJH recombination. This type of rearrangement provides a means to alter the targeting of immunoglobulin gene segments and suggests a mechanism for the occurrence of VH-JH junctions in vivo. Signal sequence replacement may represent an additional pathway for the generation of antibody diversity.
RNA can act as a template for DNA synthesis in the reverse transcription of retroviruses and retrotransposons and in the elongation of telomeres. Despite its abundance in the nucleus, there has been no evidence for a direct role of RNA as a template in the repair of any chromosomal DNA lesions, including DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are repaired in most organisms by homologous recombination or by non-homologous end joining. An indirect role for RNA in DNA repair, following reverse transcription and formation of a complementary DNA, has been observed in the non-homologous joining of DSB ends. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which homologous recombination is efficient, RNA was shown to mediate recombination, but only indirectly through a cDNA intermediate generated by the reverse transcriptase function of Ty retrotransposons in Ty particles in the cytoplasm. Although pairing between duplex DNA and single-strand (ss)RNA can occur in vitro and in vivo, direct homologous exchange of genetic information between RNA and DNA molecules has not been observed. We show here that RNA can serve as a template for DNA synthesis during repair of a chromosomal DSB in yeast. The repair was accomplished with RNA oligonucleotides complementary to the broken ends. This and the observation that even yeast replicative DNA polymerases such as alpha and delta can copy short RNA template tracts in vitro demonstrate that RNA can transfer genetic information in vivo through direct homologous interaction with chromosomal DNA.
One of the main transitions in evolution is the shift from solitary organisms to societies with reproductive division of labour. Understanding social evolution requires us to determine how ecological, social and genetic factors jointly influence group stability and partitioning of reproduction between group members. Here we test the role of the three key factors predicted to influence social evolution by experimentally manipulating them in a social allodapine bee. We show that increased relatedness between nestmates results in more even reproduction among group members and a greater productivity per individual. By contrast, the degree of reproductive skew is not influenced by the opportunity for solitary breeding or by the potential benefits of cooperation. Relatedness also has a positive effect on group stability and overall productivity. These findings are in line with predictions of the tug-of-war models, in which the degree of reproductive division of labour is determined primarily by selfish competition between group members. The alternative view, where the degree of reproductive skew is the outcome of a social contract between potential breeders, was not supported by the data.
The derivation of human ES cells (hESCs) from human blastocysts represents one of the milestones in stem cell biology. The full potential of hESCs in research and clinical applications requires a detailed understanding of the genetic network that governs the unique properties of hESCs. Here, we report a genome-wide RNA interference screen to identify genes which regulate self-renewal and pluripotency properties in hESCs. Interestingly, functionally distinct complexes involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodelling are among the factors identified in the screen. To understand the roles of these potential regulators of hESCs, we studied transcription factor PRDM14 to gain new insights into its functional roles in the regulation of pluripotency. We showed that PRDM14 regulates directly the expression of key pluripotency gene POU5F1 through its proximal enhancer. Genome-wide location profiling experiments revealed that PRDM14 colocalized extensively with other key transcription factors such as OCT4, NANOG and SOX2, indicating that PRDM14 is integrated into the core transcriptional regulatory network. More importantly, in a gain-of-function assay, we showed that PRDM14 is able to enhance the efficiency of reprogramming of human fibroblasts in conjunction with OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4. Altogether, our study uncovers a wealth of novel hESC regulators wherein PRDM14 exemplifies a key transcription factor required for the maintenance of hESC identity and the reacquisition of pluripotency in human somatic cells.
The genetic linkage of the endogenous C3H/HeJ C-type ecotropic virus to phosphoglucomutase-1 (0.28, recombinant fraction) on chromosome 5 was established by means of serological assays of backcrossed mice. With a combination of serological techniques and DNA-DNA hybridization the BALB/c endogenous ecotropic virus was shown to be either closely linked or allelic with the C3H/HeJ locus.
An important unanswered question in ecology is whether processes such as species interactions that occur at a local scale can generate large-scale patterns seen in nature. Because of the complexity of natural ecosystems, developing an adequate theoretical framework to scale up local processes has been challenging. Models of complex systems can produce a wide array of outcomes; therefore, model parameter values must be constrained by empirical information to usefully narrow the range of predicted behaviour. Under some conditions, spatially explicit models of locally interacting objects (for example, cells, sand grains, car drivers, or organisms), variously termed cellular automata or interacting particle models, can self-organize to develop complex spatial and temporal patterning at larger scales in the absence of any externally imposed pattern. When these models are based on transition probabilities of moving between ecological states at a local level, relatively complex versions of these models can be linked readily to empirical information on ecosystem dynamics. Here, I show that an empirically derived cellular automaton model of a rocky intertidal mussel bed based on local interactions correctly predicts large-scale spatial patterns observed in nature.
The evolution of family life has traditionally been studied in parallel by behavioral ecologists and quantitative geneticists. The former focus on parent-offspring conflict and whether parents or offspring control provisioning, whereas the latter concentrate on the coadaptation of parental supply and offspring demand. Here we show how prenatal effects on offspring begging can link the two different approaches. Using theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that when offspring control provisioning, prenatal effects primarily serve the parent's interests: Selection on parents drives coadaptation of parent and offspring traits. In contrast, when parents control provisioning, prenatal effects primarily serve the offspring's interests: Selection on the offspring drives coadaptation of parent and offspring traits. Parent-offspring conflict may thus be responsible for the selective forces that generate parent-offspring coadaptation.
In a recent Letter to Nature, Lee and colleagues combined optogenetic stimulation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (ofMRI) to examine the relationship between pyramidal-cell spiking and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. To do so, they injected an adeno-associated viral vector into the primary motor cortex (M1) of adult rats to drive the expression of channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in cortical projection neurons, thus making them sensitive to light. The authors then used combined light stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the effects of selective activation of the light-sensitive pyramidal cells on the BOLD signal, as well as to probe the value of this methodology for mapping brain connectivity. They found that excitation of these neurons induced positive BOLD signals both in the injected M1 region and in remote target thalamic nuclei receiving direct projections from that region, and concluded that ofMRI reliably links positive BOLD signals with increased local neuronal excitation. However, their analysis neglects the almost immediate activation of other circuits that could lead to the generation of BOLD signals through local perisynaptic rather than spiking activity. Their experiments therefore do not pin down the identity of the specific neuronal signals that give rise to the BOLD signal.
White adipose (fat) tissues regulate metabolism, reproduction, and life span. Adipocytes form throughout life, with the most marked expansion of the lineage occurring during the postnatal period. Adipocytes develop in coordination with the vasculature, but the identity and location of white adipocyte progenitor cells in vivo are unknown. We used genetically marked mice to isolate proliferating and renewing adipogenic progenitors. We found that most adipocytes descend from a pool of these proliferating progenitors that are already committed, either prenatally or early in postnatal life. These progenitors reside in the mural cell compartment of the adipose vasculature, but not in the vasculature of other tissues. Thus, the adipose vasculature appears to function as a progenitor niche and may provide signals for adipocyte development.
The essential mammalian enzyme O-linked b-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase, here OGT) couples metabolic status to the regulation of a wide variety of cellular signalling pathways by acting as a nutrient sensor. OGT catalyses the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serines and threonines of cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins, including numerous transcription factors, tumour suppressors, kinases, phosphatases and histone-modifying proteins. Aberrant glycosylation by OGT has been linked to insulin resistance, diabetic complications, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. Despite the importance of OGT, the details of how it recognizes and glycosylates its protein substrates are largely unknown. We report here two crystal structures of human OGT, as a binary complex with UDP (2.8 A resolution) and as a ternary complex with UDP and a peptide substrate (1.95 A). The structures provide clues to the enzyme mechanism, show how OGT recognizes target peptide sequences, and reveal the fold of the unique domain between the two halves of the catalytic region. This information will accelerate the rational design of biological experiments to investigate OGT's functions; it will also help the design of inhibitors for use as cellular probes and help to assess its potential as a therapeutic target.
Negative feedback is common in biological processes and can increase a system's stability to internal and external perturbations. But at the molecular level, control loops always involve signalling steps with finite rates for random births and deaths of individual molecules. Here we show, by developing mathematical tools that merge control and information theory with physical chemistry, that seemingly mild constraints on these rates place severe limits on the ability to suppress molecular fluctuations. Specifically, the minimum standard deviation in abundances decreases with the quartic root of the number of signalling events, making it extremely expensive to increase accuracy. Our results are formulated in terms of experimental observables, and existing data show that cells use brute force when noise suppression is essential; for example, regulatory genes are transcribed tens of thousands of times per cell cycle. The theory challenges conventional beliefs about biochemical accuracy and presents an approach to the rigorous analysis of poorly characterized biological systems.
UvrA+-dependent excision repair is one of the most important systems in Escherichia coli for repairing UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and a variety of other forms of DNA damage. The uvrA protein acts in conjunction with the uvrB and uvrC gene products to introduce a nick at the of a DNA lesion and thus initiate the repair process. We have recently used the Mud(Ap, lac) operon fusion vector to identify a set of genes whose expression is induced by DNA damage. One Mud(Ap, lac) insertion mapped at the uvrA locus and made the cells sensitive to UV light. In this fusion strain, beta-galactosidase expression was induced by DNA-damaging agents in a recA+lexA+-dependent fashion. We were surprised by this result because uvrA+-dependent excision repair is observed both in cells in which protein synthesis has been inhibited and in recA- and lexA- cells, findings which have led to the conclusion that the uvrA gene product is constitutively expressed and not under the control of the complex recA+lexA+ regulatory circuitry (see below). We have investigated this possibility further and describe here the generation and characterization of a set of fusions of the lac genes to the promoter of the uvrA gene. We confirm that the uvrA gene product is induced by DNA damage in a recA+lexA+-dependent fashion.
The mammary epithelium is composed of several cell lineages including luminal, alveolar and myoepithelial cells. Transplantation studies have suggested that the mammary epithelium is maintained by the presence of multipotent mammary stem cells. To define the cellular hierarchy of the mammary gland during physiological conditions, we performed genetic lineage-tracing experiments and clonal analysis of the mouse mammary gland during development, adulthood and pregnancy. We found that in postnatal unperturbed mammary gland, both luminal and myoepithelial lineages contain long-lived unipotent stem cells that display extensive renewing capacities, as demonstrated by their ability to clonally expand during morphogenesis and adult life as well as undergo massive expansion during several cycles of pregnancy. The demonstration that the mammary gland contains different types of long-lived stem cells has profound implications for our understanding of mammary gland physiology and will be instrumental in unravelling the cells at the origin of breast cancers.
When frog skeletal muscle fibres are bathed in solutions containing Cs(+) and K(+) in the ratio 1:4,000, a reduction is observed in the size of inward K currents through the resting membrane. This effect is enhanced by an increase in either hyperpolarisation or external Cs(+) concentration. It can be predicted from these findings that regenerative changes in membrane potential should be obtainable in fibres, in the presence of Cs(+), that are hyperpolarised by means of a current electrode. Such responses are described in the last part of this report. In squid axon and frog node, internal Cs(+) produces a voltage-dependent block of the delayed, outward K currents, though the ratio of Cs(+) to K(+) required for this effect is far greater than that used in the experiments reported here. A closer parallel can be drawn between our findings and those recently reported on the inward K currents in the starfish egg cell.
Small noncoding RNAs regulate processes essential for cell growth and development, including mRNA degradation, translational repression, and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). During a search for candidate mammalian factors for TGS, we purified a complex that contains small RNAs and Riwi, the rat homolog to human Piwi. The RNAs, frequently 29 to 30 nucleotides in length, are called Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), 94% of which map to 100 defined (< or = 101 kb) genomic regions. Within these regions, the piRNAs generally distribute across only one genomic strand or distribute on two strands but in a divergent, nonoverlapping manner. Preparations of piRNA complex (piRC) contain rRecQ1, which is homologous to qde-3 from Neurospora, a gene implicated in silencing pathways. Piwi has been genetically linked to TGS in flies, and slicer activity cofractionates with the purified complex. These results are consistent with a gene-silencing role for piRC in mammals.
The initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells is a highly regulated process that leads to the duplication of the genetic information for the next cell generation. This requires the ordered assembly of many proteins at the origins of DNA replication to form a competent, pre-replicative chromosomal state. In addition to this competent complex, at least two cell cycle regulated protein kinase pathways are required to affect a transition to a post-replicative chromosomal state. Protein kinases required to establish mitosis prevent re-replication of the DNA. As cells exit mitosis, the cell cycle is reset, allowing the establishment of a new, competent replication state.
Detailed analysis of neuronal network architecture requires the development of new methods. Here we present strategies to visualize synaptic circuits by genetically labelling neurons with multiple, distinct colours. In Brainbow transgenes, Cre/lox recombination is used to create a stochastic choice of expression between three or more fluorescent proteins (XFPs). Integration of tandem Brainbow copies in transgenic mice yielded combinatorial XFP expression, and thus many colours, thereby providing a way to distinguish adjacent neurons and visualize other cellular interactions. As a demonstration, we reconstructed hundreds of neighbouring axons and multiple synaptic contacts in one small volume of a cerebellar lobe exhibiting approximately 90 colours. The expression in some lines also allowed us to map glial territories and follow glial cells and neurons over time in vivo. The ability of the Brainbow system to label uniquely many individual cells within a population may facilitate the analysis of neuronal circuitry on a large scale.
Many congenital malformations, such as cleft palate and neural tube defects, have a multifactorial origin involving both environmental and genetic factors. Conditions such as these may be exclusively monogenic, polygenic or environmental, but in most cases both genetic and environmental factors are involved. This study describes the sub-chromosomal localization of a single gene defect causing cleft palate and ankyloglossia (tongue-tied) in a large Icelandic family. This defect is a model for the analysis of other neural-crest malformations that show a more complex multifactorial inheritance pattern.
In animals with internal fertilization, paternity is uncertain. In birds, the occurrence of copulations outside the pair-bond has been documented in a number of species, but the extent to which these result in illegitimate young is largely unknown, and constitutes a major deficiency in our understanding of avian mating systems. The analysis of tandemly repeated sequences (minisatellites), has enhanced our ability to make individual identifications and paternity determinations. Here we describe the use of a bird minisatellite DNA probe in assigning paternity in natural populations of the monogamous willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus and of the polygynous wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix. In both species this probe detects a multiple locus pattern and a single locus that exhibits a variable number of tandem repeats. Although we observed intrusions by non-resident males into the territories of paired males and extra-pair copulations, no illegitimate offspring were detected among 176 young from 32 families of both species, implying that extra-pair copulations have little or no genetic impact.
Evolutionary theory predicts that local population divergence will depend on the balance between the diversifying effect of selection and the homogenizing effect of gene flow. However, spatial variation in the expression of genetic variation will also generate differential evolutionary responses. Furthermore, if dispersal is non-random it may actually reinforce, rather than counteract, evolutionary differentiation. Here we document the evolution of differences in body mass within a population of great tits, Parus major, inhabiting a single continuous woodland, over a 36-year period. We show that genetic variance for nestling body mass is spatially variable, that this generates different potential responses to selection, and that this diversifying effect is reinforced by non-random dispersal. Matching the patterns of variation, selection and evolution with population ecological data, we argue that the small-scale differentiation is driven by density-related differences in habitat quality affecting settlement decisions. Our data show that when gene flow is not homogeneous, evolutionary differentiation can be rapid and can occur over surprisingly small spatial scales. Our findings have important implications for questions of the scale of adaptation and speciation, and challenge the usual treatment of dispersal as a force opposing evolutionary differentiation.
The pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the skin disease chytridiomycosis, is one of the few highly virulent fungi in vertebrates and has been implicated in worldwide amphibian declines. However, the mechanism by which Bd causes death has not been determined. We show that Bd infection is associated with pathophysiological changes that lead to mortality in green tree frogs (Litoria caerulea). In diseased individuals, electrolyte transport across the epidermis was inhibited by >50%, plasma sodium and potassium concentrations were respectively reduced by approximately 20% and approximately 50%, and asystolic cardiac arrest resulted in death. Because the skin is critical in maintaining amphibian homeostasis, disruption to cutaneous function may be the mechanism by which Bd produces morbidity and mortality across a wide range of phylogenetically distant amphibian taxa.
Nuclear transplantation can reprogramme a somatic genome back into an embryonic epigenetic state, and the reprogrammed nucleus can create a cloned animal or produce pluripotent embryonic stem cells. One potential use of the nuclear cloning approach is the derivation of 'customized' embryonic stem (ES) cells for patient-specific cell treatment, but technical and ethical considerations impede the therapeutic application of this technology. Reprogramming of fibroblasts to a pluripotent state can be induced in vitro through ectopic expression of the four transcription factors Oct4 (also called Oct3/4 or Pou5f1), Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4. Here we show that DNA methylation, gene expression and chromatin state of such induced reprogrammed stem cells are similar to those of ES cells. Notably, the cells-derived from mouse fibroblasts-can form viable chimaeras, can contribute to the germ line and can generate live late-term embryos when injected into tetraploid blastocysts. Our results show that the biological potency and epigenetic state of in-vitro-reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells are indistinguishable from those of ES cells.
In female eutherian mammals preferential inactivation of the paternally derived X chromosome (XP) takes place in certain extra-embryonic tissues such as mouse yolk-sac endoderm, chorionic ectoderm and trophoblast and has been demonstrated both biochemically and cytologically. This is thought to be due to the paternal X chromosome being 'imprinted', that is, somehow marked as different, during either male gametogenesis or fertilization, causing primary nonrandom X-inactivation in tissues that differentiate early, such as trophectoderm and primitive endoderm, from which yolk-sac endoderm is derived. Different alleles of the X-chromosome controlling element, Xce locus, centrally located on the mouse X chromosome, also cause primary nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation in embryonic tissues which would otherwise show random inactivation. The work reported here was designed to elucidate whether the nonrandom inactivation of the imprinted XP in yolk-sac endoderm could be modified, or even overridden, by the effect of different Xce alleles. Using the modified Kanda method we have therefore studied the proportion of cells at metaphase with the XP inactive in separated yolk-sac endoderm and mesoderm of mouse embryos heterozygous for a marker X chromosome (Cattanach's translocation) carrying different Xce alleles on XP and XM. The results show that the extreme Xcec allele, when present on the paternally derived X, can significantly reduce the proportion of inactive XP seen in yolk-sac endoderm compared with controls. This is the first evidence that imprinting of XP is not an 'all or none' event but can be modified by a 'strong' allele at the Xce locus, and is another indication that the Xce locus may represent the inactivation centre.
The Ras proto-oncogene is a central component of mitogenic signal-transduction pathways, and is essential for cells both to leave a quiescent state (G0) and to pass through the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. The mechanism by which Ras signalling regulates cell-cycle progression is unclear, however. Here we report that the retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor protein (Rb), a regulator of G1 exit, functionally links Ras to passage through the G1 phase. Inactivation of Ras in cycling cells caused a decline in cyclin D1 protein levels, accumulation of the hypophosphorylated, growth-suppressive form of Rb, and G1 arrest. When Rb was disrupted either genetically or biochemically, cells failed to arrest in G1 following Ras inactivation. In contrast, inactivation of Ras in quiescent cells prevented growth-factor induction of both immediate-early gene transcription and exit from G0 in an Rb-independent manner. These data suggest that Rb is an essential G1-specific mediator that links Ras-dependent mitogenic signalling to cell-cycle regulation.
Proteins capable of self-perpetuating changes in conformation and function (known as prions) can serve as genetic elements. To test whether novel prions could be created by recombinant methods, a yeast prion determinant was fused to the rat glucocorticoid receptor. The fusion protein existed in different heritable functional states, switched between states at a low spontaneous rate, and could be induced to switch by experimental manipulations. The complete change in phenotype achieved by transferring a prion determinant from one protein to another confirms the protein-only nature of prion inheritance and establishes a mechanism for engineering heritable changes in phenotype that should be broadly applicable.
The climatic and environmental changes associated with the last glaciation (90,000 to 10,000 years before the present; 90 to 10 ka B.P.) are an important example of the effects of global climate change on biological diversity. These effects were particularly marked in Beringia (northeastern Siberia, northwestern North America, and the exposed Bering Strait) during the late Pleistocene. To investigate the evolutionary impact of these events, we studied genetic change in the brown bear, Ursus arctos, in eastern Beringia over the past 60,000 years using DNA preserved in permafrost remains. A marked degree of genetic structure is observed in populations throughout this period despite local extinctions, reinvasions, and potential interspecies competition with the short-faced bear, Arctodus simus. The major phylogeographic changes occurred 35 to 21 ka B.P., before the glacial maximum, and little change is observed after this time. Late Pleistocene histories of mammalian taxa may be more complex than those that might be inferred from the fossil record or contemporary DNA sequences alone.
Genetic similarity owing to kin relationship is often invoked to explain the evolution of social cooperation. In this study, male color morphs of side-blotched lizards settle nonrandomly with respect to genetic similarity. Blue morphs tend to settle in close proximity to other blue morphs with high genetic similarity. Blue neighbors have three times the average fitness of blue males lacking such neighbors. Conversely, genetically similar males depress fitness of the orange morph. Moreover, orange males are hyperdispersed with respect to genetic similarity. Pedigree and dispersal data show that genetically similar blue neighbors are not kin. Instead, conditions for the evolution of dispersal and cooperation are promoted by an emergent property of the morph locus that increases genetic similarity within morphs: genome-wide correlational selection links many traits to the morph locus, including settlement behavior.
Rhizomes of stinging nettle contain a small-sized lectin that exhibits binding specificity toward chitin. This lectin inhibits growth of several phytopathogenic and saprophytic chitin-containing fungi in vitro. The antifungal action of the nettle lectin differs from the action of chitinases, which are a ubiquitous class of antifungal plant proteins. Moreover, the nettle lectin acts synergistically with chitinase in inhibiting fungal growth. The nettle lectin may be a promising candidate for possible applications in the genetic engineering of disease-resistant crops.
The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a sialoglycoprotein of M(r) 33-35K that is expressed predominantly in neurons. In transmissible and genetic neurodegenerative disorders such as scrapie of sheep, spongiform encephalopathy of cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob or Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker diseases of humans, PrPC is converted into an altered form (termed PrPSc) which is distinguishable from its normal homologue by its relative resistance to protease digestion. PrPSc accumulates in the central nervous system of affected individuals, and its protease-resistant core aggregates extracellularly into amyloid fibrils. The process is accompanied by nerve cell loss, whose pathogenesis and molecular basis are not understood. We report here that neuronal death results from chronic exposure of primary rat hippocampal cultures to micromolar concentrations of a peptide corresponding to residues 106-126 of the amino-acid sequence deduced from human PrP complementary DNA. DNA fragmentation of degenerating neurons indicates that cell death occurred by apoptosis. The PrP peptide 106-126 has a high intrinsic ability to polymerize into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. These findings indicate that cerebral accumulation of PrPSc and its degradation products may play a role in the nerve cell degeneration that occurs in prion-related encephalopathies.
Polycystic kidney diseases are genetic disorders in which the renal parenchyma is progressively replaced by fluid-filled cysts. Two members of the polycystin family (polycystin-1 and -2) are mutated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and polycystin-L is deleted in mice with renal and retinal defects. Polycystins are membrane proteins that share significant sequence homology, especially polycystin-2 and -L (50% identity and 71% similarity). The functions of the polycystins remain unknown. Here we show that polycystin-L is a calcium-modulated nonselective cation channel that is permeable to sodium, potassium and calcium ions. Patch-clamp experiments revealed single-channel activity with a unitary conductance of 137 pS. Channel activity was substantially increased when either the extracellular or intracellular calcium-ion concentration was raised, indicating that polycystin-L may act as a transducer of calcium-mediated signalling in vivo. Its large single-channel conductance and regulation by calcium ions distinguish it from other structurally related cation channels.
Africa is the source of all modern humans, but characterization of genetic variation and of relationships among populations across the continent has been enigmatic. We studied 121 African populations, four African American populations, and 60 non-African populations for patterns of variation at 1327 nuclear microsatellite and insertion/deletion markers. We identified 14 ancestral population clusters in Africa that correlate with self-described ethnicity and shared cultural and/or linguistic properties. We observed high levels of mixed ancestry in most populations, reflecting historical migration events across the continent. Our data also provide evidence for shared ancestry among geographically diverse hunter-gatherer populations (Khoesan speakers and Pygmies). The ancestry of African Americans is predominantly from Niger-Kordofanian (approximately 71%), European (approximately 13%), and other African (approximately 8%) populations, although admixture levels varied considerably among individuals. This study helps tease apart the complex evolutionary history of Africans and African Americans, aiding both anthropological and genetic epidemiologic studies.
Lipid-bilayer membranes supported on solid substrates are widely used as cell-surface models that connect biological and artificial materials. They can be placed either directly on solids or on ultrathin polymer supports that mimic the generic role of the extracellular matrix. The tools of modern genetic engineering and bioorganic chemistry make it possible to couple many types of biomolecule to supported membranes. This results in sophisticated interfaces that can be used to control, organize and study the properties and function of membranes and membrane-associated proteins. Particularly exciting opportunities arise when these systems are coupled with advanced semiconductor technology.
Rapid access to genetic information is central to the revolution taking place in molecular genetics. The simultaneous analysis of the entire human mitochondrial genome is described here. DNA arrays containing up to 135,000 probes complementary to the 16.6-kilobase human mitochondrial genome were generated by light-directed chemical synthesis. A two-color labeling scheme was developed that allows simultaneous comparison of a polymorphic target to a reference DNA or RNA. Complete hybridization patterns were revealed in a matter of minutes. Sequence polymorphisms were detected with single-base resolution and unprecedented efficiency. The methods described are generic and can be used to address a variety of questions in molecular genetics including gene expression, genetic linkage, and genetic variability.
When exposed to increased dissolved solute in their environment (hyperosmotic stress), all eukaryotic cells respond by rapidly activating a conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, known in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway. Intensive genetic and biochemical analysis in this organism has revealed the presumptive osmosensors, downstream signaling components, and metabolic and transcriptional changes that allow cells to cope with this stressful condition. These findings have had direct application to understanding stress sensing and control of transcription by stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases in mammalian cells.
We have hypothesized that end-to-end chromosome fusions observed in some tumours could play a part in genetic instability associated with tumorigenesis and that fusion may result from the loss of the long stretches of G-rich repeats found at the ends of all linear chromosomes. We therefore asked whether there is telomere loss or reduction in common tumours. Here we show that in most of the colorectal carcinomas that we analysed, there is a reduction in the length of telomere repeat arrays relative to the normal colonic mucosa from the same patient. We speculate on the consequences of this loss for tumorigenesis. We also show that the telomere arrays are much smaller in colonic mucosa and blood than in fetal tissue and sperm, and that there is a reduction in average telomere length with age in blood and colon mucosa. We propose that the telomerase is inactive in somatic tissues, and that telomere length is an indicator of the number of cell divisions that it has taken to form a particular tissue and possibly to generate tumours.
Yeast genetics and in vitro biochemical analysis have identified numerous genes involved in protein secretion. As compared with yeast, however, the metazoan secretory pathway is more complex and many mechanisms that regulate organization of the Golgi apparatus remain poorly characterized. We performed a genome-wide RNA-mediated interference screen in a Drosophila cell line to identify genes required for constitutive protein secretion. We then classified the genes on the basis of the effect of their depletion on organization of the Golgi membranes. Here we show that depletion of class A genes redistributes Golgi membranes into the endoplasmic reticulum, depletion of class B genes leads to Golgi fragmentation, depletion of class C genes leads to aggregation of Golgi membranes, and depletion of class D genes causes no obvious change. Of the 20 new gene products characterized so far, several localize to the Golgi membranes and the endoplasmic reticulum.
Transposable genetic elements in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, when inserted at a given locus, can control expression of the locus and cause large scale rearrangements of adjacent DNA sequences. Striking similarities in genetic behaviour between the two groups of elements have led to the proposal of a molecular model of eukaryotic controlling elements, and to suggestions about the part such elements may play in evolution and differentiation.
Germ cells preserve an individual's genetic information and transmit it to the next generation. Early in development germ cells are set aside and undergo a specialized developmental programme, a hallmark of which is the migration from their site of origin to the future gonad. In Drosophila, several factors have been identified that control germ-cell migration to their target tissues; however, the germ-cell chemoattractant or its receptor have remained unknown. Here we apply genetics and in vivo imaging to show that odysseus, a zebrafish homologue of the G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor Cxcr4, is required specifically in germ cells for their chemotaxis. odysseus mutant germ cells are able to activate the migratory programme, but fail to undergo directed migration towards their target tissue, resulting in randomly dispersed germ cells. SDF-1, the presumptive cognate ligand for Cxcr4, shows a similar loss-of-function phenotype and can recruit germ cells to ectopic sites in the embryo, thus identifying a vertebrate ligand-receptor pair guiding migratory germ cells at all stages of migration towards their target.
Ocean general circulation theories predict that the position of the boundary between subtropical and subpolar gyres (and therefore the position of the Gulf Stream-North Atlantic Current system and the subpolar-subtropical front) is set by the line of zero "Ekman pumping," where there is no convergence or divergence of water in the directly wind-forced surface layer of the ocean. In the present-day North Atlantic Ocean this line runs southwest to northeast, from off the Carolinas to off Ireland. However, during the last ice age (18,000 years ago) the subpolar-subtropical boundary ran more zonally, directly toward Gibraltar. A numerical atmospheric general circulation model indicates that the field of Ekman pumping 18,000 years ago was modified by the presence of a continental ice cap more than 3 kilometers thick such that the line of zero Ekman pumping overlaid the paleogyre boundary. These results demonstrate that the presence of a thick continental ice sheet could have caused changes in sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic during Quaternary glaciations by altering wind patterns.
A Drosophila gene that contains both a paired box and a homeobox and has extensive sequence homology to the mouse Pax-6 (Small eye) gene was isolated and mapped to chromosome IV in a region close to the eyeless locus. Two spontaneous mutations, ey2 and eyR, contain transposable element insertions into the cloned gene and affect gene expression, particularly in the eye primordia. This indicates that the cloned gene encodes ey. The finding that ey of Drosophila, Small eye of the mouse, and human Aniridia are encoded by homologous genes suggests that eye morphogenesis is under similar genetic control in both vertebrates and insects, in spite of the large differences in eye morphology and mode of development.
Agrobacterium tumefaciens incites crown gall tumors when bacterial DNA integrates into plant nuclear DNA. Plant cells can express these integrated bacterial genes. Following insertion of desired genes into bacterial DNA using recombinant DNA techniques, this system permits introduction of these new genes into plant DNA. We discuss the potential for genetic manipulation of plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the related organism Agrobacterium rhizogenes.
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key regulator of pain perception, cognitive function, and affective mood. Three common haplotypes of the human COMT gene, divergent in two synonymous and one nonsynonymous position, code for differences in COMT enzymatic activity and are associated with pain sensitivity. Haplotypes divergent in synonymous changes exhibited the largest difference in COMT enzymatic activity, due to a reduced amount of translated protein. The major COMT haplotypes varied with respect to messenger RNA local stem-loop structures, such that the most stable structure was associated with the lowest protein levels and enzymatic activity. Site-directed mutagenesis that eliminated the stable structure restored the amount of translated protein. These data highlight the functional significance of synonymous variations and suggest the importance of haplotypes over single-nucleotide polymorphisms for analysis of genetic variations.
The human lambda immunoglobulin locus displays a series of restriction fragment length polymorphisms that are readily detected in small populations of normal individuals. Similar polymorphisms appear in populations of wild mice, suggesting that the lambda locus is subject to rapid variation within a single species. Here we show that the polymorphisms seen in the human lambda locus seem to have arisen from unequal meiotic crossing over, altering the number of lambda from as few as six to as many as nine per haploid genome. This expansion and contraction in the number of human lambda genes is significant in that it may affect an individual's capacity to produce variation among lambda light chain genes.
The kinetoplastid Protozoa are responsible for devastating diseases. In the Americas, Trypanosoma cruzi is the agent of Chagas' disease--a widespread disease transmissible from animals to humans (zoonosis)--which is transmitted by exposure to infected faeces of blood-sucking triatomine bugs. The presence of genetic exchange in T. cruzi and in Leishmania is much debated. Here, by producing hybrid clones, we show that T. cruzi has an extant capacity for genetic exchange. The mechanism is unusual and distinct from that proposed for the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei. Two biological clones of T. cruzi were transfected to carry different drug-resistance markers, and were passaged together through the entire life cycle. Six double-drug-resistant progeny clones, recovered from the mammalian stage of the life cycle, show fusion of parental genotypes, loss of alleles, homologous recombination, and uniparental inheritance of kinetoplast maxicircle DNA. There are strong genetic parallels between these experimental hybrids and the genotypes among natural isolates of T. cruzi. In this instance, aneuploidy through nuclear hybridization results in recombination across far greater genetic distances than mendelian genetic exchange. This mechanism also parallels genome duplication.
A subset of neurons in the brain, known as 'glucose-excited' neurons, depolarize and increase their firing rate in response to increases in extracellular glucose. Similar to insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells, glucose excitation of neurons is driven by ATP-mediated closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels. Although beta-cell-like glucose sensing in neurons is well established, its physiological relevance and contribution to disease states such as type 2 diabetes remain unknown. To address these issues, we disrupted glucose sensing in glucose-excited pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons via transgenic expression of a mutant Kir6.2 subunit (encoded by the Kcnj11 gene) that prevents ATP-mediated closure of K(ATP) channels. Here we show that this genetic manipulation impaired the whole-body response to a systemic glucose load, demonstrating a role for glucose sensing by POMC neurons in the overall physiological control of blood glucose. We also found that glucose sensing by POMC neurons became defective in obese mice on a high-fat diet, suggesting that loss of glucose sensing by neurons has a role in the development of type 2 diabetes. The mechanism for obesity-induced loss of glucose sensing in POMC neurons involves uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a mitochondrial protein that impairs glucose-stimulated ATP production. UCP2 negatively regulates glucose sensing in POMC neurons. We found that genetic deletion of Ucp2 prevents obesity-induced loss of glucose sensing, and that acute pharmacological inhibition of UCP2 reverses loss of glucose sensing. We conclude that obesity-induced, UCP2-mediated loss of glucose sensing in glucose-excited neurons might have a pathogenic role in the development of type 2 diabetes.
The initiation of X-chromosome inactivation is thought to be tightly correlated with early differentiation events during mouse development. Here, we show that although initially active, the paternal X chromosome undergoes imprinted inactivation from the cleavage stages, well before cellular differentiation. A reversal of the inactive state, with a loss of epigenetic marks such as histone modifications and polycomb proteins, subsequently occurs in cells of the inner cell mass (ICM), which give rise to the embryo-proper in which random X inactivation is known to occur. This reveals the remarkable plasticity of the X-inactivation process during preimplantation development and underlines the importance of the ICM in global reprogramming of epigenetic marks in the early embryo.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common and severe form of the muscular dystrophies, is an X-linked inborn error of metabolism with multiple tissue involvement. Although the major pathological changes are observed in skeletal muscle, abnormalities have also been detected in the heart, nervous system, red blood cells, lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts. For many reasons, such as readily available tissue material, fewer secondary changes and the potential for prenatal diagnosis, cultured skin fibroblasts should be the tissue of choice to search for the primary defect. Several abnormalities have been reported in DMD fibroblasts, suggesting that the genetic abnormality is expressed in these cells. To search for potentially mutant protein(s) we have compared the protein composition of normal and DMD fibroblasts by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and have now found one protein spot consistently missing in DMD cells. The nature of this protein and its relation to the DMD gene are unknown.
The avian acute leukemia virus E26 induces a mixed erythroid-myeloid leukemia in chickens and carries two distinct oncogenes, v-myb and v-ets. Recently, a novel gene named erg, closely related to the v-ets oncogene, was identified in human COLO 320 cells and the nucleotide sequence of its approximately 5.0-kilobase transcript, erg 1 was determined. In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of the alternatively spliced transcript, erg 2, was found to differ from erg 1 by a splicing event that causes a coding frameshift near the amino terminus, resulting in an additional 99-amino acid insertion at the amino-terminus. Expression of complementary DNAs for the two transcripts in vitro resulted in synthesis of polypeptides of approximately 41 and 52 kilodaltons, suggesting the use of alternative translation initiation codons in the case of erg proteins. The erg gene was localized by somatic cell genetic analysis to human chromosome 21. It is proposed that alternative sites of splicing and polyadenylation, together with alternative sites of translation initiation, allow the synthesis of two related polypeptides from a single erg gene transcriptional unit.
The milk protein beta-lactoglobulin has been extensively studied but its function has not been identified. A clue regarding the function of a protein can be obtained by discovering a genetic relationship with a protein of known function through comparisons of amino acid sequence. Such comparisons revealed that beta-lactoglobulin is similar to human serum retinol-binding protein and to another human protein of unknown function known as complex-forming glycoprotein heterogeneous in charge (protein HC). beta-Lactoglobulins from several species have been found to bind retinol, while the absorption and fluorescence properties reported for the unidentified heterogeneous prosthetic group of protein HC are retinoid-like. The role of serum retinol-binding protein in vitamin A transport in the circulation suggests that the other two homologous proteins may function in the binding and transport of retinoids; beta-lactoglobulin may facilitate the absorption of vitamin A from milk and protein HC may mediate the excretion of retinol-derived metabolites.
The in vitro growth of immature erythroid precursors, assayed as burst forming units (BFU-E), can be enhanced by co-culturing with normal T cells. The growth enhancing effect of normal T cells, however, was shown to be the outcome of at least two functionally distinct subpopulations, one that enhances burst formation and one that limits it. It appears that the T cell population limiting growth enhancement of the erythroid precursors expresses 'Ia-like' antigen (Ia+) because treatment of T cells with anti-Ia antibody and complement significantly increased the ability of the remaining T cells to stimulate antologous BFU-E growth. As BFU-E also seem to express Ia, the inhibiting effect of certain T cells on BFU-E growth may involve the Ia molecule. We show here that the inhibitory effect of Ia+ T cells on BFU-E growth is genetically restricted to cell combinations which are phenotypically identical for at least one HLA-DR (Ia-like) antigen.
The ability to distinguish between kin and non-kin is critical to current theories of altruistic behaviour and kin selection. Hamilton predicted that individuals would behave differently towards one another depending on the genetic relatedness between them. When either proximity to or familiarity with kin is a good predictor of relatedness, the mechanism by which favouritism towards kin is accomplished may not require special kin recognition abilities. However, if proximity and familiarity are poor predictors of kinship, favouritism (hence increases in inclusive fitness) could only be achieved by the differential recognition of kin and non-kin. We have previously shown that Cascades frog (Rana cascadae) tadpoles reared with siblings prefer to associate with siblings over non-siblings. The present study is the first to report that totally naive individuals (R. cascadae tadpoles) prefer to associate with siblings over non-siblings. Because tadpoles were separated before hatching and reared apart from other individuals, results suggest that the ability of these tadpoles to discriminate between siblings and non-siblings has some innate component.
Viral diversity and life cycles are poorly understood in the human gut and other body habitats. Phages and their encoded functions may provide informative signatures of a human microbiota and of microbial community responses to various disturbances, and may indicate whether community health or dysfunction is manifest after apparent recovery from a disease or therapeutic intervention. Here we report sequencing of the viromes (metagenomes) of virus-like particles isolated from faecal samples collected from healthy adult female monozygotic twins and their mothers at three time points over a one-year period. We compared these data sets with data sets of sequenced bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and total-faecal-community DNA. Co-twins and their mothers share a significantly greater degree of similarity in their faecal bacterial communities than do unrelated individuals. In contrast, viromes are unique to individuals regardless of their degree of genetic relatedness. Despite remarkable interpersonal variations in viromes and their encoded functions, intrapersonal diversity is very low, with >95% of virotypes retained over the period surveyed, and with viromes dominated by a few temperate phages that exhibit remarkable genetic stability. These results indicate that a predatory viral-microbial dynamic, manifest in a number of other characterized environmental ecosystems, is notably absent in the very distal intestine.
Cytogenetic studies of blood lymphocytes of Marshall Islanders, 10 years after their exposure to radiation from fallout in 1954, show chromosome-type aberrations in 23 of 43 exposed persons. Half the aberrations are of the exchange type. An unexpectedly large number of acentric fragments, but no exchange-type aberrations, appear in a few unexposed people on the same island.
Andesites represent a large proportion of the magmas erupted at continental arc volcanoes and are regarded as a major component in the formation of continental crust. Andesite petrogenesis is therefore fundamental in terms of both volcanic hazard and differentiation of the Earth. Andesites typically contain a significant proportion of crystals showing disequilibrium petrographic characteristics indicative of mixing or mingling between silicic and mafic magmas, which fuels a long-standing debate regarding the significance of these processes in andesite petrogenesis and ultimately questions the abundance of true liquids with andesitic composition. Central to this debate is the distinction between liquids (or melts) and magmas, mixtures of liquids with crystals, which may or may not be co-genetic. With this distinction comes the realization that bulk-rock chemical analyses of petrologically complex andesites can lead to a blurred picture of the fundamental processes behind arc magmatism. Here we present an alternative view of andesite petrogenesis, based on a review of quenched glassy melt inclusions trapped in phenocrysts, whole-rock chemistry, and high-pressure and high-temperature experiments. We argue that true liquids of intermediate composition (59 to 66 wt% SiO(2)) are far less common in the sub-volcanic reservoirs of arc volcanoes than is suggested by the abundance of erupted magma within this compositional range. Effective mingling within upper crustal magmatic reservoirs obscures a compositional bimodality of melts ascending from the lower crust, and masks the fundamental role of silicic melts (>/=66 wt% SiO(2)) beneath intermediate arc volcanoes. This alternative view resolves several puzzling aspects of arc volcanism and provides important clues to the integration of plutonic and volcanic records.
On the basis of available nucleotide sequence and genetic data; we present a model for RNA splicing in fungal mitochondria. Seven intron RNAs of two fungal species can form identical secondary structures, involving four conserved sequences, which bring the ends of each intron together and allow an internal guide RNA sequence to pair with exon bases adjacent to the splice junctions. The splicing sites are thus aligned precisely within a conserved structure, which we suggest could present specific recognition signals to the proteins that catalyse the splicing reaction.
Face grooming sequences that involve coordination of the shoulders, tongue, and eyes develop remarkably normally in inbred mice with one or both forelimbs amputated from birth. This indicates endogenous control with a strong genetic component. Evidence for the maturational expression of "sensory expectations" was also obtained.
The genetic analysis of reproductive isolation between species of Drosophila has now reached the resolution necessary to start answering one of the fundamental questions of evolution: what is the genetic basis of species differences? A.H. Sturtevant, one of the founders of Drosophila genetics, was fascinated by this question and thought he had found a way to analyse it when he realized that 'Drosophila melanogaster' was actually two species: D. melanogaster and D. simulans. By passing genes between these two species he hoped to investigate their genetic differences directly. No doubt he was disappointed to find that the D. melanogaster/D. simulans hybridization resulted only in unisexual sterile hybrids, a disappointment appreciated all the more by modern evolutionary biologists. Seventy-five years after Sturtevant's description of D. melanogaster/D. simulans hybrid sterility, we have discovered a strain of D. simulans that produces fertile female hybrids in crosses with D. melanogaster. Our discovery promises to bring the enormous resolution of D. melanogaster genetics to the study of reproductive isolation and species differences.
Cruciform structures in DNA are of considerable interest, both as extreme examples of sequence-dependent structural heterogeneity and as models for four-way junctions such as the Holliday junction of homologous genetic recombination. Cruciforms are of lower thermodynamic stability than regular duplex DNA, and have been observed only in negatively supercoiled molecules, where the unfavourable free energy of formation is offset by the topological relaxation of the torsionally stressed molecule. From an experimental viewpoint this can be a disadvantage, as cruciform structures can be studied only in relatively large supercoiled DNA circles, and are destabilized when a break is introduced at any point. We therefore set out to construct a pseudo-cruciform junction--by generating hereroduplex formation between two inverted repeat sequences. Stereochemically, this should closely resemble a true cruciform but remain stable in a linear DNA fragment. We have now created such a junction and find that it has the expected sensitivities to endonucleases. These DNA fragments exhibit extremely anomalous gel electrophoretic mobility, the extent of which depends on the relative position of the pseudo-cruciform along the length of the molecule. Our results are very similar to those obtained by Wu and Crothers using kinetoplast DNA, and we conclude that the pseudo-cruciform junction introduces a bend in the linear DNA molecule.
In Drosophila elaboration of positional identity along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral embryonic body axes involves early zygotic gene functions that are expressed in response to maternal cues present in the unfertilized egg. Zygotic loci that are required for the specification of positional identity along the anterior-posterior body axis have been described in detail. Less is known about the zygotic loci responsible for differentiation of the dorsal-ventral pattern; however, several genes that might be involved have been identified. Zerknullt (zen) is an example of a zygotic gene required for correct differentiation of dorsally derived embryonic tissues. On the basis of homoeo box cross homology, we have now isolated a gene, called S60, that derives from the zen region of the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C). Transcripts encoded by S60 transiently accumulate in the dorsal-most tissues of developing embryos. This pattern of expression suggests that S60 corresponds to zen. Since S60 contains a homoeo box, it is possible that differentiation of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral embryonic patterns involves similar molecular mechanisms.
Round to oval, scalelike siliceous microstructures from cherts in Cambrian limestones of the western Yukon Territory suggest affinity with chrysophycean algae. At least six morphotypes present include porous forms with single branching processes and nonporous oval, ringlike forms. Partially dissolved specimens may indicate a contribution to contemporaneous or early diagenetic chert formation.
The direct oncogenic potential of X rays has been demonstrated by the in vitro neoplastic transformation of mammalian cells in culture, a technique which permits the study of oncogenesis in the absence of host-specific effects. Although several agents are known to modulate in vitro neoplastic transformation by X rays, little is known of the effects of hormones. We now describe experiments which show that the presence of thyroid hormone is necessary for in vitro neoplastic transformation by X rays in cells of an established mouse fibroblast culture (C3H/10T1/2) and in early-passage diploid hamster embryo cells.
The size of an organism is genetically determined, yet how a plant or animal achieves its final size is largely unknown. The shoot of higher plants has a simple conserved body plan based on three major tissue systems: the epidermal (L1), sub-epidermal (L2) and inner ground and vascular (L3) tissues. Which tissue system drives or restricts growth has been a subject of debate for over a century. Here, we use dwarf, brassinosteroid biosynthesis and brassinosteroid response mutants in conjunction with tissue-specific expression of these components as tools to examine the role of the epidermis in shoot growth. We show that expression of the brassinosteroid receptor or a brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzyme in the epidermis, but not in the vasculature, of null mutants is sufficient to rescue their dwarf phenotypes. Brassinosteroid signalling from the epidermis is not sufficient to establish normal vascular organization. Moreover, shoot growth is restricted when brassinosteroids are depleted from the epidermis and brassinosteroids act locally within a leaf. We conclude that the epidermis both promotes and restricts shoot growth by providing a non-autonomous signal to the ground tissues.
The evolutionary theory of ageing explains why ageing occurs, giving valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying the complex cellular and molecular changes that contribute to senescence. Such understanding also helps to clarify how the genome shapes the ageing process, thereby aiding the study of the genetic factors that influence longevity and age-associated diseases.
Micro-complement fixation studies of eastern and western populations of the North American tree frog Hyla chrysoscelis reveal they have been genetically isolated for about 4 million years. Immunological comparisons of populations of the cryptic tetraploid Hyla versicolor indicate a recent origin, from hybridization between eastern and western H. chrysoscelis.
Cell division is arrested in many organisms in response to DNA damage. Examinations of the genetic basis for this response in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that the RAD9 gene product is essential for arrest of cell division induced by DNA damage. Wild-type haploid cells irradiated with x-rays either arrest or delay cell division in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Irradiated G1 and M phase haploid cells arrest irreversibly in G2 and die, whereas irradiated G2 phase haploid cells delay in G2 for a time proportional to the extent of damage before resuming cell division. In contrast, irradiated rad9 cells in any phase of the cycle do not delay cell division in G2, but continue to divide for several generations and die. However, efficient DNA repair can occur in irradiated rad9 cells if irradiated cells are blocked for several hours in G2 by treatment with a microtubule poison. The RAD9-dependent response detects potentially lethal DNA damage and causes arrest of cells in G2 until such damage is repaired.
The mechanism by which disruption of reading frame can influence pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing is poorly understood. We assessed the role of factors essential for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in nonsense-mediated altered splicing (NAS) with the use of RNA interference (RNAi) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of rent1/hUpf1 expression abrogated both NMD and NAS of nonsense T cell receptor beta transcripts. In contrast, inhibition of rent2/hUpf2 expression did not disrupt NAS despite achieving comparable stabilization of nonsense transcripts. We also demonstrate that NAS and NMD are genetically separable functions of rent1/hUpf1. Additionally, rent1/hUpf1 enters the nucleus where it may directly influence early events in mRNA biogenesis. This provides compelling evidence that NAS relies on a component of the nonsense surveillance machinery but is not an indirect consequence of NMD.
The generally mild bleeding disorder of von Willebrand disease is associated with abnormalities of two distinct plasma proteins, the large multimeric von Willebrand factor (vWF), which mediates platelet adhesion, and von Willebrand antigen II (vW AgII), which is of unknown function. The two proteins were found to have a common biosynthetic origin in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, which explains their simultaneous absence in the severe form of this hereditary disease. Shared amino acid sequences from a 100-kilodalton plasma glycoprotein and from vW AgII are identical to amino acid sequences predicted from a complementary DNA clone encoding the 5' end of vWF. In addition, these proteins have identical molecular weights and immunologic cross reactivities. Monoclonal antibodies prepared against both proteins recognize epitopes on the pro-vWF subunit and on a 100-kilodalton protein that are not present on the mature vWF subunit in endothelial cell lysates. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies against vWF recognize both pro-vWF and vWF subunits. Thus, the 100-kilodalton plasma glycoprotein and vW AgII are identical proteins and represent an extremely large propolypeptide that is first cleaved from pro-vWF during intracellular processing and then released into plasma.
The highest award to which a mathematician can aspire is the Fields Medal, an award comparable in many respects to a Nobel Prize in the prestige it confers. J.C. Fields, who set up a trust for the gold medals that constitute the award, said only that they should be made "in recognition of work already done and as an encouragement for further achievements on the part of the recipient." This has been interpreted to mean that the medals should be given to young mathematicians (generally those under the age of 40), a tradition that has been closely followed since the first two medals were awarded in 1936. The Fields Medals are given out only every 4 years, at the quadrennial convening of the International Congress of Mathematicians. This year, Fields Medals were presented to Gregory A. Margoulis of the Soviet Union, Daniel Quillan of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Charles Fefferman of Princeton University, and Pierre Deligne of the Institute des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques in France.
The oxygen isotopic compositions of two calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) from the unequilibrated ordinary chondrite meteorites Quinyambie and Semarkona are enriched in 16O by an amount similar to that in CAIs from carbonaceous chondrites. This may indicate that most CAIs formed in a restricted region of the solar nebula and were then unevenly distributed throughout the various chondrite accretion regions. The Semarkona CAI is isotopically homogeneous and contains highly 16O-enriched melilite, supporting the hypothesis that all CAI minerals were originally 16O-rich, but that in most carbonaceous chondrite inclusions some minerals exchanged oxygen isotopes with an external reservoir following crystallization.
Current concepts of the pathogenesis of emphysema suggest that it results from an imbalance of elastase and antielastase activity within the alveolar structures. Although emphysema that is associated with hereditary deficiency of serum alpha 1-antitrypsin conforms to this scheme, the major risk factor in the more common form of emphysema is cigarette smoking. A study was designed to evaluate the premise that cigarette smoking may be associated with an acquired, functional defect in lung alpha 1-antitrypsin. Determination of the antielastase activity of alpha 1-antitrypsin obtained from the lungs of smoking and nonsmoking individuals revealed a nearly twofold reduction in the functional activity of this elastase inhibitor in the lungs of cigarette smokers. These data suggest that cigarette smokers may lose some of the normal antielastase protective screen of the lower respiratory tract, making them more vulnerable to destructive lung disease.
The H19 gene produces an abundant developmentally regulated transcript of unknown function in normal embryos. In the mouse it lies on chromosome 7 and is subject to transcriptional regulation by parental imprinting, which results in the maternally inherited gene being expressed and the paternally inherited gene being repressed. Embryos carrying maternal duplication/paternal deficiency for distal chromosome 7 (MatDi7) therefore express a double dose of H19. Here we examine the parental-origin-specific epigenetic modifications that may be involved in this regulation by comparing CpG methylation and nuclease sensitivity of chromatin in MatDi7 embryos with normal littermates. We show that specific sites in the CpG island promoter and 5' portion of the gene are methylated only on the paternal allele. Furthermore, active maternal alleles in chromatin of MatDi7 embryos are more sensitive and accessible to nucleases. Therefore hypermethylation and chromatin compaction in the region of the H19 promoter is associated with repression of the paternally inherited copy of the gene. Most, but not all, of these sites are unmethylated in sperm, with methylation of the paternal promoter occurring after fertilization. These results contrast with our findings for the closely linked and reciprocally imprinted gene encoding insulin-like growth factor II (ref. 4).
Water environments with temperatures up to and above boiling are commonly found in association with geothermal activity. At temperatures above 60 degrees C, only bacteria are found. Bacteria with temperature optima over the range 65 degrees to 105 degrees C have been obtained in pure culture and are the object of many research projects. The upper temperature limit for life in liquid water has not yet been defined, but is likely to be somewhere between 110 degrees and 200 degrees C, since amino acids and nucleotides are destroyed at temperatures over 200 degrees C. Because bacteria capable of growth at high temperatures are found in many phylogenetic groups, it is likely that the ability to grow at high temperature had a polyphyletic origin. The macromolecules of these organisms are inherently more stable to heat than those of conventional organisms, but only small changes in sequence can lead to increases in thermostability. Because of their unique properties, thermophilic organisms and their enzymes have many potential biotechnological uses, and extensive research on industrial applications is under way.
Proximal spinal muscular atrophies represent the second most common fatal, autosomal recessive disorder after cystic fibrosis. The childhood form is classically subdivided into three groups: acute Werdnig-Hoffmann (type I), intermediate Werdnig-Hoffmann disease (type II) and Kugelberg-Welander disease (type III). These different clinical forms have previously been attributed to either genetic heterogeneity or variable expression of different mutations at the same locus. Research has been hindered because the underlying biochemical defect is unknown, and there are insufficient large pedigrees with the most common and severe form (type I) available for study. Therefore, we have undertaken a genetic linkage analysis of the chronic forms of the disease (types II and III) as an initial step towards the ultimate goal of characterizing the gene(s) responsible for all three types. We report here the assignment of the locus for the chronic forms to the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q12-q14), with the anonymous DNA marker D5S39, in 24 multiplex families of distinct ethnic origin. Furthermore, no evidence for genetic heterogeneity was found for types II and III in our study, suggesting that these two forms are allelic disorders.
The Arabidopsis gene AGAMOUS is required for male and female reproductive organ development and for floral determinacy. Reverse genetics allowed the isolation of a transposon-induced mutation in ZAG1, the maize homolog of AGAMOUS. ZAG1 mutants exhibited a loss of determinacy, but the identity of reproductive organs was largely unaffected. This suggested a redundancy in maize sex organ specification that led to the identification and cloning of a second AGAMOUS homolog, ZMM2, that has a pattern of expression distinct from that of ZAG1. C-function organ identity in maize (as defined by the A, B, C model of floral organ development) may therefore be orchestrated by two closely related genes, ZAG1 and ZMM2, with overlapping but nonidentical activities.
Changes which enhance adaptedness to the environment occur in experimental populations of Drosophila serrata which are acted upon by strong natural selection. The improvement is greater in hybrid than in single-strain populations because genetic variability is greater in the former.
Clinical, genetic, and neuropsychopharmacological studies of developmental factors in alcoholism are providing a better understanding of the neurobiological bases of personality and learning. Studies of the adopted-away children of alcoholics show that the predisposition to initiate alcohol-seeking behavior is genetically different from susceptibility to loss of control after drinking begins. Alcohol-seeking behavior is a special case of exploratory appetitive behavior and involves different neurogenetic processes than do susceptibility to behavioral tolerance and dependence on the antianxiety or sedative effects of alcohol. Three dimensions of personality have been described that may reflect individual differences in brain systems modulating the activation, maintenance, and inhibition of behavioral responses to the effects of alcohol and other environmental stimuli. These personality traits distinguish alcoholics with different patterns of behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuropharmacological responses to alcohol.
Although both parental sexes contribute equivalent genetic information to the zygote, in mammals this information is not necessarily functionally equivalent. Diploid parthenotes possessing two maternal genomes are generally inviable, embryos possessing two paternal genomes in man may form hydatidiform moles, and nuclear transplantation experiments in mice have shown that both parental genomes are necessary for complete embryogenesis. Not all of the genome is involved in these parental effects, however, because zygotes with maternal or paternal disomy for chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 9, 13, 14 and 15 of the mouse survive normally. On the other hand, only the maternal X chromosome is active in mouse extraembryonic membranes, maternal disomy 6 is lethal, while non-complementation of maternal duplication/paternal deficiency or its reciprocal for regions of chromosome 2, 8 and 17 has been recognized. We report that animals with maternal duplication/paternal deficiency and its reciprocal for each of two particular chromosome regions show anomalous phenotypes which depart from normal in opposite directions, suggesting a differential functioning of gene loci within these regions. A further example of non-complementation lethality is also reported.
One of the central challenges of evolutionary biology is to understand how coevolution organizes biodiversity over complex geographic landscapes. Most species are collections of genetically differentiated populations, and these populations have the potential to become adapted to their local environments in different ways. The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution incorporates this idea by proposing that spatial variation in natural selection and gene flow across a landscape can shape local coevolutionary dynamics. These effects may be particularly strong when populations differ across productivity gradients, where gene flow will often be asymmetric among populations. Conclusive empirical tests of this theory have been particularly difficult to perform because they require knowledge of patterns of gene flow, historical population relationships and local selection pressures. We have tested these predictions empirically using a model community of bacteria and bacteriophage (viral parasitoids of bacteria). We show that gene flow across a spatially structured landscape alters coevolution of parasitoids and their hosts and that the resulting patterns of adaptation can fluctuate in both space and time.
The centromere is essential for the inheritance of genetic information on eukaryotic chromosomes. Epigenetic regulation of centromere identity has been implicated in genome stability, karyotype evolution, and speciation. However, little is known regarding the manner in which centromere dysfunction affects the chromosomal architectures. Here we show that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the conditional deletion of the centromere produces survivors that carry either a neocentromere-acquired chromosome at the subtelomeric region or an acentric chromosome rescued by intertelomere fusion with either of the remaining chromosomes. The ratio of neocentromere formation to telomere fusion is considerably decreased by the inactivation of genes involved in RNA interference-dependent heterochromatin formation. By affecting the modes of chromosomal reorganization, the genomic distribution of heterochromatin may influence the fate of karyotype evolution.
Several evolutionarily conserved proteins constitute a universal mitotic trigger that is precisely controlled during the orderly cell divisions of embryogenesis. As development progresses, the mechanisms controlling this trigger change. Early divisions are executed by maternally synthesized gene products, and in Xenopus they are timed by the accumulation and periodic degradation of cyclin, a trigger component. Later, the zygotic genome assumes control, and in Drosophila, zygotic transcription is required for production of another trigger protein, the product of string. After this transition to zygotic control, pulses of string transcription define the timing of highly patterned embryonic cell divisions and cyclin accumulation is not rate limiting.
Synapses develop concurrently and at identical rates in different layers of the visual, somatosensory, motor, and prefrontal areas of the primate cerebral cortex. This isochronic course of synaptogenesis in anatomically and functionally diverse regions indicates that the entire cerebral cortex develops as a whole and that the establishment of cell-to-cell communication in this structure may be orchestrated by a single genetic or humoral signal. This is in contrast to the traditional view of hierarchical development of the cortical regions and provides new insight into the maturation of cortical functions.
The imprinted regulation of H19 and Insulin-like growth factor 2 expression involves binding of the vertebrate insulator protein, CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), to the maternally hypomethylated differentially methylated domain (DMD). How this hypomethylated state is maintained during oogenesis and the role of CTCF, if any, in this process are not understood. With the use of a transgenic RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach to generate oocytes with reduced amounts of CTCF protein, we found increased methylation of the H19 DMD and decreased developmental competence of CTCF-deficient oocytes. Our results suggest that CTCF protects the H19 DMD from de novo methylation during oocyte growth and is required for normal preimplantation development.
Social insects show multiple levels of self identity. Most individuals are sterile workers who selflessly labor for their colony, which is often viewed as a superorganism. The superorganism protects itself with colony recognition systems based on learned odors, typically cuticular hydrocarbons. Transfer of these odors within the colony obscures separate clan identities. Residual individual interests do appear to cause conflicts within colonies over sex ratio, male production, caste, and reproductive dominance. However, genomic imprinting theory predicts that the individual's maternal and paternal genes will evolve separate infraorganismal identities, perhaps leaving virtually no coherent individual identity.
The nature of the jets and the role of magnetic fields in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains unclear. In a baryon-dominated jet only weak, tangled fields generated in situ through shocks would be present. In an alternative model, jets are threaded with large-scale magnetic fields that originate at the central engine and that accelerate and collimate the material. To distinguish between the models the degree of polarization in early-time emission must be measured; however, previous claims of gamma-ray polarization have been controversial. Here we report that the early optical emission from GRB 090102 was polarized at 10 +/- 1 per cent, indicating the presence of large-scale fields originating in the expanding fireball. If the degree of polarization and its position angle were variable on timescales shorter than our 60-second exposure, then the peak polarization may have been larger than ten per cent.
Although DNA is the carrier of genetic information, it has limited chemical stability. Hydrolysis, oxidation and nonenzymatic methylation of DNA occur at significant rates in vivo, and are counteracted by specific DNA repair processes. The spontaneous decay of DNA is likely to be a major factor in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and ageing, and also sets limits for the recovery of DNA fragments from fossils.
Forward genetic screens in model organisms have provided important insights into numerous aspects of development, physiology and pathology. With the availability of complete genome sequences and the introduction of RNA-mediated gene interference (RNAi), systematic reverse genetic screens are now also possible. Until now, such genome-wide RNAi screens have mostly been restricted to cultured cells and ubiquitous gene inactivation in Caenorhabditis elegans. This powerful approach has not yet been applied in a tissue-specific manner. Here we report the generation and validation of a genome-wide library of Drosophila melanogaster RNAi transgenes, enabling the conditional inactivation of gene function in specific tissues of the intact organism. Our RNAi transgenes consist of short gene fragments cloned as inverted repeats and expressed using the binary GAL4/UAS system. We generated 22,270 transgenic lines, covering 88% of the predicted protein-coding genes in the Drosophila genome. Molecular and phenotypic assays indicate that the majority of these transgenes are functional. Our transgenic RNAi library thus opens up the prospect of systematically analysing gene functions in any tissue and at any stage of the Drosophila lifespan.
Variable gene expression within a clonal population of cells has been implicated in a number of important processes including mutation and evolution, determination of cell fates and the development of genetic disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that a significant component of expression variability arises from extrinsic factors thought to influence multiple genes simultaneously, yet the biological origins of this extrinsic variability have received little attention. Here we combine computational modelling with fluorescence data generated from multiple promoter-gene inserts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify two major sources of extrinsic variability. One unavoidable source arising from the coupling of gene expression with population dynamics leads to a ubiquitous lower limit for expression variability. A second source, which is modelled as originating from a common upstream transcription factor, exemplifies how regulatory networks can convert noise in upstream regulator expression into extrinsic noise at the output of a target gene. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay of gene regulatory networks with population heterogeneity for understanding the origins of cellular diversity.
Since the introduction of gel electrophoresis to population genetics, estimates of genic heterozygosity at allozyme loci have been made for many organisms. However, attempts to extend the range of proteins surveyed have been hampered by concern that there may have been bias in the loci sampled: nearly all proteins for which population data are available are soluble in low-salt extracts and most are enzymes belonging to particular groups such as the nonspecific esterases and phosphatases, various dehydrogenases and the enzymes of the glycolytic pathways and the citric acid cycle. Until recently, there were no techniques for estimating protein variation which were without such bias. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, however, offered hope of overcoming this bias, and it has proved useful for the resolution of proteins in crude homogenates and for estimating genetic variation. We have examined heterozygosity in a wild population of the house mouse (Mus musculus) by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis of whole kidney. As we report here, the observed level (2%) is substantially below the level detected by starch gel electrophoresis. Our results corroborate similar differences observed in Drosophila and man.
Mechanical activation of the microtubule sliding mechanism in cilia and flagella by local passive bending has been postulated to be essential for the initiation and propagation of bending waves along the axoneme. In addition, responsiveness of cilia to hydrodynamic forces imposed externally by their neighbours is thought to be responsible for metachronal coordination of ciliary activity, as well as for synchronal beating of component cilia within compound ciliary organelles. Direct tests of the mechanosensitivity of motile cilia are limited, but generally support these views. It remains problematical, however, whether mechanical interaction between cilia operates continuously during both the effective and recovery phases of the asymmetrical beat cycle. Moreover, the directional sensitivity and temporal responsiveness of motile cilia to mechanical stimuli have been explored in only a few cases. Finally, the continuous nature of the ciliary beat cycle has hindered investigation of the 'switch point hypothesis' in which doublet sliding is assumed to be activated sequentially on the two halves of the axoneme to produce bends in opposite directions. Here we report that macrocilia on the ctenophore Beroe beat discontinuously with separate effective and recovery strokes, resulting in 'split-cycle' waves of metachronal coordination. This new pattern of ciliary beating is used to investigate the motile responses of cilia to controlled mechanical stimuli during each phase of the beat cycle.
A high degree of polymorphism for the length and copy number of rDNA spacers, in both the X and Y chromosome clusters, has been found in a wild population of Drosophila melanogaster. The genetic behaviour of rDNA structural variants in separate and mixed populations derived from isofemale lines suggest that they are not subject to strong selection and are stable for over 1,000 generations. The high structural variability suggests an evolutionary rapid process of turnover in the family which could partly explain widespread sequence homogeneity (concerted evolution) of rDNA within a species.
The ability of insect colonies to adjust the division of labor among workers in response to changing environmental and colony conditions, coupled with research showing genetic effects on the division of labor in honey bee colonies, led to an investigation of the role of genetics and the environment in the integration of worker behavior. Measurements of juvenile hormone(JH) titers and allozyme analyses of worker honey bees suggest that two processes are involved in colony-level regulation of division of labor: (i) plasticity in age-dependent behavior is a consequence of modulation of JH titers by extrinsic factors, and (ii) stimuli that can affect JH titers and age-dependent behavior do elicit variable responses among genetically distinct subpopulations of workers within a colony. These results provide a new perspective on the developmental plasticity of insect colonies and support the emerging view that colony genetic structure affects behavioral organization.
Mice of the C57BL/6 strain are resistant to the development of skin squamous carcinomas (SCCs) induced by an activated Ras oncogene, whereas FVB/N mice are highly susceptible. The genetic basis of this difference in phenotype is unknown. Here we show that susceptibility to SCC is under the control of a carboxy-terminal polymorphism in the mouse Ptch gene. F1 hybrids between C57BL/6 and FVB/N strains ((B6FVB)F1) are resistant to Ras-induced SCCs, but resistance can be overcome either by elimination of the C57BL/6 Ptch allele (Ptch(B6)) or by overexpression of the FVB/N Ptch allele (Ptch(FVB)) in the epidermis of K5Hras-transgenic (B6FVB)F1 hybrid mice. The human Patched (PTCH) gene is a classical tumour suppressor gene for basal cell carcinomas and medulloblastomas, the loss of which causes increased signalling through the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway. SCCs that develop in PtchB6+/- mice do not lose the wild-type Ptch gene or show evidence of increased SHH signalling. Although Ptch(FVB) overexpression can promote SCC formation, continued expression is not required for tumour maintenance, suggesting a role at an early stage of tumour cell lineage commitment. The Ptch polymorphism affects Hras-induced apoptosis, and binding to Tid1, the mouse homologue of the Drosophila l(2)tid tumour suppressor gene. We propose that Ptch occupies a critical niche in determining basal or squamous cell lineage, and that both tumour types can arise from the same target cell depending on carcinogen exposure and host genetic background.
Prior to meiosis in triploid gynogenetic all-female forms of Poeciliopsis, the chromosome number of the nucleus of the triploid oogonium is raised endomitotically to hexaploid. Recombination does not occur; instead, a triploid ovum with a genetic complement identical to that of the mother is produced by two conventional meiotic divisions. Sperm from a sympatric gonochoristic (bisexual) species stimulates the ovum to develop, but paternal genes are not incorporated into the zygote. This is the first cytologically verified case of natural endomitosis in the egg production in fish.
Mitochondrial calcium uptake has a central role in cell physiology by stimulating ATP production, shaping cytosolic calcium transients and regulating cell death. The biophysical properties of mitochondrial calcium uptake have been studied in detail, but the underlying proteins remain elusive. Here we use an integrative strategy to predict human genes involved in mitochondrial calcium entry based on clues from comparative physiology, evolutionary genomics and organelle proteomics. RNA interference against 13 top candidates highlighted one gene, CBARA1, that we call hereafter mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1). Silencing MICU1 does not disrupt mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential but abolishes mitochondrial calcium entry in intact and permeabilized cells, and attenuates the metabolic coupling between cytosolic calcium transients and activation of matrix dehydrogenases. MICU1 is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and has two canonical EF hands that are essential for its activity, indicating a role in calcium sensing. MICU1 represents the founding member of a set of proteins required for high-capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake. Its discovery may lead to the complete molecular characterization of mitochondrial calcium uptake pathways, and offers genetic strategies for understanding their contribution to normal physiology and disease.
Metabolic syndrome is a group of obesity-related metabolic abnormalities that increase an individual's risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here, we show that mice genetically deficient in Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a component of the innate immune system that is expressed in the gut mucosa and that helps defend against infection, exhibit hyperphagia and develop hallmark features of metabolic syndrome, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and increased adiposity. These metabolic changes correlated with changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and transfer of the gut microbiota from TLR5-deficient mice to wild-type germ-free mice conferred many features of metabolic syndrome to the recipients. Food restriction prevented obesity, but not insulin resistance, in the TLR5-deficient mice. These results support the emerging view that the gut microbiota contributes to metabolic disease and suggest that malfunction of the innate immune system may promote the development of metabolic syndrome.
Cloning of mammals by nuclear transfer (NT) results in gestational or neonatal failure with at most a few percent of manipulated embryos resulting in live births. Many of those that survive to term succumb to a variety of abnormalities that are likely due to inappropriate epigenetic reprogramming. Cloned embryos derived from donors, such as embryonic stem cells, that may require little or no reprogramming of early developmental genes develop substantially better beyond implantation than NT clones derived from somatic cells. Although recent experiments have demonstrated normal reprogramming of telomere length and X chromosome inactivation, epigenetic information established during gametogenesis, such as gametic imprints, cannot be restored after nuclear transfer. Survival of cloned animals to birth and beyond, despite substantial transcriptional dysregulation, is consistent with mammalian development being rather tolerant to epigenetic abnormalities, with lethality resulting only beyond a threshold of faulty gene reprogramming encompassing multiple loci.
Whole-genome sequencing of the protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi revealed that the diploid genome contains a predicted 22,570 proteins encoded by genes, of which 12,570 represent allelic pairs. Over 50% of the genome consists of repeated sequences, such as retrotransposons and genes for large families of surface molecules, which include trans-sialidases, mucins, gp63s, and a large novel family (>1300 copies) of mucin-associated surface protein (MASP) genes. Analyses of the T. cruzi, T. brucei, and Leishmania major (Tritryp) genomes imply differences from other eukaryotes in DNA repair and initiation of replication and reflect their unusual mitochondrial DNA. Although the Tritryp lack several classes of signaling molecules, their kinomes contain a large and diverse set of protein kinases and phosphatases; their size and diversity imply previously unknown interactions and regulatory processes, which may be targets for intervention.
Given the continuing difficulty of identifying genes for complex disorders in a robust, replicable manner, and the extensive resources devoted to this effort, it is becoming increasingly important to analyze the relative benefits of genomics research for public health applications and for the understanding of disease pathogenesis. To establish priorities for genetics research, we review and evaluate several characteristics of selected exemplary complex diseases, including phenotypic accuracy, knowledge of specific and nonspecific genetic and environmental risk factors, and population prevalence and impact. We propose that complex diseases with the strongest evidence for genetic etiology, limited ability to modify exposure or risk factors, and high public health impact should have the highest priority for genetics research.
Schizophrenia (SCZD) is a debilitating neurological disorder with a world-wide prevalence of 1%; there is a strong genetic component, with an estimated heritability of 80-85%. Although post-mortem studies have revealed reduced brain volume, cell size, spine density and abnormal neural distribution in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of SCZD brain tissue and neuropharmacological studies have implicated dopaminergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic activity in SCZD, the cell types affected in SCZD and the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease state remain unclear. To elucidate the cellular and molecular defects of SCZD, we directly reprogrammed fibroblasts from SCZD patients into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and subsequently differentiated these disorder-specific hiPSCs into neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1). SCZD hiPSC neurons showed diminished neuronal connectivity in conjunction with decreased neurite number, PSD95-protein levels and glutamate receptor expression. Gene expression profiles of SCZD hiPSC neurons identified altered expression of many components of the cyclic AMP and WNT signalling pathways. Key cellular and molecular elements of the SCZD phenotype were ameliorated following treatment of SCZD hiPSC neurons with the antipsychotic loxapine. To date, hiPSC neuronal pathology has only been demonstrated in diseases characterized by both the loss of function of a single gene product and rapid disease progression in early childhood. We now report hiPSC neuronal phenotypes and gene expression changes associated with SCZD, a complex genetic psychiatric disorder.
Two families were studied in which the same homolog of chromosome pair 10 expressed both the fragile sites on the long (q) arm at 10q23 and 10q25. Recombination between the fragile sites was observed in 3 of the 27 offspring in whom it could occur. The genetic length of chromosome between the fragile sites was 11 female centimorgans within a 95 percent probability interval of 4 to 28 centimorgans. This estimate of genetic length is comparable to those obtained with other methods.
Cortical gamma oscillations (20-80 Hz) predict increases in focused attention, and failure in gamma regulation is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disease. Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with the resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200 Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast, pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations, a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude and precision of evoked responses. Our data directly support the fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis and provide the first causal evidence that distinct network activity states can be induced in vivo by cell-type-specific activation.
To create mice expressing exclusively human sickle hemoglobin (HbS), transgenic mice expressing human alpha-, gamma-, and betaS-globin were generated and bred with knockout mice that had deletions of the murine alpha- and beta-globin genes. These sickle cell mice have the major features (irreversibly sickled red cells, anemia, multiorgan pathology) found in humans with sickle cell disease and, as such, represent a useful in vivo system to accelerate the development of improved therapies for this common genetic disease.
Cellular signaling networks have evolved to enable swift and accurate responses, even in the face of genetic or environmental perturbation. Thus, genetic screens may not identify all the genes that regulate different biological processes. Moreover, although classical screening approaches have succeeded in providing parts lists of the essential components of signaling networks, they typically do not provide much insight into the hierarchical and functional relations that exist among these components. We describe a high-throughput screen in which we used RNA interference to systematically inhibit two genes simultaneously in 17,724 combinations to identify regulators of Drosophila JUN NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK). Using both genetic and phosphoproteomics data, we then implemented an integrative network algorithm to construct a JNK phosphorylation network, which provides structural and mechanistic insights into the systems architecture of JNK signaling.
The past 10 years have seen the discovery of unexpected levels of conservation of gene content and gene orders over millions of years of evolution within grasses, crucifers, legumes, some trees, and Solanaceae crops. Within the grasses, which include the three 500-million-ton-plus-per-year crops (wheat, maize, and rice), and the crucifers, which include all the Brassica crops, colinearity looks good enough to do most map-based cloning only in the small genome model species, rice and Arabidopsis. Elsewhere, knowledge gained in a few major crops is being pooled and applied across the board. The extrapolation of information from the well-studied species to orphan crops, which include many tropical species, is providing a solid base for their improvement. Genome rearrangements are giving new insights into evolution. In fact, comparative genetics is the key that will unlock the secrets of crop plants with genomes larger than that of humans.
Kinesin is a two-headed motor protein that powers organelle transport along microtubules. Many ATP molecules are hydrolysed by kinesin for each diffusional encounter with the microtubule. Here we report the development of a new assay in which the processive movement of individual fluorescently labelled kinesin molecules along a microtubule can be visualized directly; this observation is achieved by low-background total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in the absence of attachment of the motor to a cargo (for example, an organelle or bead). The average distance travelled after a binding encounter with a microtubule is 600 nm, which reflects a approximately 1% probability of detachment per mechanical cycle. Surprisingly, processive movement could still be observed at salt concentrations as high as 0.3 M NaCl. Truncated kinesin molecules having only a single motor domain do not show detectable processive movement, which is consistent with a model in which kinesin's two force-generating heads operate by a hand-over-hand mechanism.
A specific deficiency of methionine adenosyltransferase has been demonstrated in the liver of an infant with hypermethioninemia. Since the enzymatic activity was below that in fetal liver and the metabolic abnormality has persisted (the infant now being 1 year of age), there is probably a genetic mutation. Mass screening for hypermethioninemia may uncover more such cases.
In March 2003, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was discovered in association with cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The sequence of the complete genome of SARS-CoV was determined, and the initial characterization of the viral genome is presented in this report. The genome of SARS-CoV is 29,727 nucleotides in length and has 11 open reading frames, and its genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons showed that SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses.
The genetic coupling of morphology and behaviour means that the evolution of the two types of traits will not be independent: changes in behaviour will result in changes in morphology and vice versa. This might explain nonadaptive differences in morphology through indirect selection on correlated characters of other categories. Genetic correlations between morphology and behaviour are also the basis for some models of sympatric speciation and of the stability of polymorphisms. Morphology and behaviour are often correlated in nature and a genetic basis for such couplings has been demonstrated. I present here evidence that colour pattern and antipredator behaviour are genetically coupled in natural populations of the garter snake Thamnophis ordinoides. Similar phenotypic correlations between pattern and behaviour exist among species of North American snakes, indicating that selection for particular combinations of traits may help to maintain genetic covariances and colour polymorphism in Thamnophis ordinoides.
A glutamine synthetase gene from alfalfa (Medicago sativa) has been expressed in Escherichia coli after fusion of bacterial transcription and translation signals to a complete alfalfa glutamine synthetase coding sequence. Synthesis of the alfalfa glutamine synthetase enzyme in Escherichia coli was demonstrated by functional genetic complementation of a glutamine synthetase-deficient mutant and by immunoblotting analysis. These results should facilitate protein engineering and structure-function analysis of the plant enzyme.
A large proportion of plant species has originated through allopolyploidy: interspecific hybridization followed by chromosome doubling. Heterozygosity remains fixed in allopolyploids because of nonsegregation of parental chromosomes. Two allotetraploid species of the fern genus Asplenium show allozyme polymorphisms at loci that are polymorphic in their diploid progenitors, indicating that each has originated more than once and implicating continued gene flow from diploids to tetraploids.
One of the most controversial issues in primate palaeontology concerns the phylogenetic position of the extinct primate infraorder Adapiformes. During the Eocene, this group of primates of modern aspect possessed a holarctic distribution, and may have been present in the poorly known Palaeogene of Africa. Mainly on the basis of craniodental morphology, at least four hypotheses have been proposed concerning the phylogenetic interrelationships among adapiforms and other primate higher taxa: (1) that adapiforms are ancestral to both lemuriforms (including Lorisoidea) and anthropoids; (2) that adapiforms cannot be shown to possess a special phylogenetic relationship with either lemuriforms or anthropoids; (3) that adapiforms are the sister taxon of lemuriforms; and (4) that Adapiformes is not a natural, monophyletic group, but rather consists of nested clades within the radiation of lemuriforms. Here, we describe features of the ankle and wrist joints of several adapiform taxa that provide an independent test of the preceding hypotheses. These traits suggest that lemuriforms are monophyletic with respect to known adapiforms, but that adapiforms nevertheless are their stem lineage (sensu Ax).
Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a subset of bone marrow cells that are capable of self-renewal and of forming all types of blood cells (multi-potential). However, the HSC 'niche'--the in vivo regulatory microenvironment where HSCs reside--and the mechanisms involved in controlling the number of adult HSCs remain largely unknown. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal has an essential role in inducing haematopoietic tissue during embryogenesis. We investigated the roles of the BMP signalling pathway in regulating adult HSC development in vivo by analysing mutant mice with conditional inactivation of BMP receptor type IA (BMPRIA). Here we show that an increase in the number of spindle-shaped N-cadherin+CD45- osteoblastic (SNO) cells correlates with an increase in the number of HSCs. The long-term HSCs are found attached to SNO cells. Two adherens junction molecules, N-cadherin and beta-catenin, are asymmetrically localized between the SNO cells and the long-term HSCs. We conclude that SNO cells lining the bone surface function as a key component of the niche to support HSCs, and that BMP signalling through BMPRIA controls the number of HSCs by regulating niche size.
Each body segment of Drosophila follows a unique developmental pathway, controlled by the selective expression of homoeotic genes such as Sex combs reduced (Scr)and the bithorax complex (BX-C). Little is known about the regulation of these genes, though several potential activators or repressers have been described. For instance, absence of the extra sex combs (esc) gene product apparently causes adventitious expression of all the BX-C genes in most or all larval body segments. Absence of the trithorax (trx) gene appears to prevent Scr and BX-C expression but only in adult cells; differentiation of the larval segments is only slightly affected. I show here that the correct segmental differentiation of the larva does not require maternally deposited trx+ product, but that the esc mutant phenotype is suppressed by the removal of the trx gene, which implies that the BX-C can be differentially expressed in the absence of both the trx gene and the esc gene product.
Cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin exert their cytotoxic effect by inducing DNA damage and activating programmed cell death (apoptosis). The tumour-suppressor protein p53 is an important activator of apoptosis. Although p53-deficient cancer cells are less responsive to chemotherapy, their resistance is not complete, which suggests that other apoptotic pathways may exist. A p53-related gene, p73, which encodes several proteins as a result of alternative splicing, can also induce apoptosis. Here we show that the amount of p73 protein in the cell is increased by cisplatin. This induction of p73 is not seen in cells unable to carry out mismatch repair and in which the nuclear enzyme c-Abl tyrosine kinase is not activated by cisplatin. The half-life of p73 is prolonged by cisplatin and by co-expression with c-Abl tyrosine kinase; the apoptosis-inducing function of p73 is also enhanced by the c-Abl kinase. Mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in mismatch repair or in c-Abl do not upregulate p73 and are more resistant to killing by cisplatin. Our results indicate that c-Abl and p73 are components of a mismatch-repair-dependent apoptosis pathway which contributes to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.
The freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata possesses a diverse family of fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs), hemolymph polypeptides that consist of one or two amino-terminal immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains and a carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen domain. Here, we show that the IgSF1 domain of the FREP3 subfamily is diversified at the genomic level at higher rates than those recorded for control genes. All sequence variants are derived from a small set of nine source sequences by point mutation and recombinatorial processes. Diverse FREP3 transcripts are also produced. We hypothesize a mechanism present in snails that is capable of diversifying molecules involved in internal defense.
Climate variability in the tropical Atlantic Ocean is determined by large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions, which particularly affect deep atmospheric convection over the ocean and surrounding continents. Apart from influences from the Pacific El Nino/Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation, the tropical Atlantic variability is thought to be dominated by two distinct ocean-atmosphere coupled modes of variability that are characterized by meridional and zonal sea-surface-temperature gradients and are mainly active on decadal and interannual timescales, respectively. Here we report evidence that the intrinsic ocean dynamics of the deep equatorial Atlantic can also affect sea surface temperature, wind and rainfall in the tropical Atlantic region and constitutes a 4.5-yr climate cycle. Specifically, vertically alternating deep zonal jets of short vertical wavelength with a period of about 4.5 yr and amplitudes of more than 10 cm s(-1) are observed, in the deep Atlantic, to propagate their energy upwards, towards the surface. They are linked, at the sea surface, to equatorial zonal current anomalies and eastern Atlantic temperature anomalies that have amplitudes of about 6 cm s(-1) and 0.4 degC, respectively, and are associated with distinct wind and rainfall patterns. Although deep jets are also observed in the Pacific and Indian oceans, only the Atlantic deep jets seem to oscillate on interannual timescales. Our knowledge of the persistence and regularity of these jets is limited by the availability of high-quality data. Despite this caveat, the oscillatory behaviour can still be used to improve predictions of sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic. Deep-jet generation and upward energy transmission through the Equatorial Undercurrent warrant further theoretical study.
Phosphorus is an essential element for all known forms of life. In living systems, phosphorus is an integral component of nucleic acids, carbohydrates and phospholipids, where it is incorporated as a derivative of phosphate. However, most Gram-negative bacteria have the capability to use phosphonates as a nutritional source of phosphorus under conditions of phosphate starvation. In these organisms, methylphosphonate is converted to phosphate and methane. In a formal sense, this transformation is a hydrolytic cleavage of a carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond, but a general enzymatic mechanism for the activation and conversion of alkylphosphonates to phosphate and an alkane has not been elucidated despite much effort for more than two decades. The actual mechanism for C-P bond cleavage is likely to be a radical-based transformation. In Escherichia coli, the catalytic machinery for the C-P lyase reaction has been localized to the phn gene cluster. This operon consists of the 14 genes phnC, phnD, ..., phnP. Genetic and biochemical experiments have demonstrated that the genes phnG, phnH, ..., phnM encode proteins that are essential for the conversion of phosphonates to phosphate and that the proteins encoded by the other genes in the operon have auxiliary functions. There are no functional annotations for any of the seven proteins considered essential for C-P bond cleavage. Here we show that methylphosphonate reacts with MgATP to form a-D-ribose-1-methylphosphonate-5-triphosphate (RPnTP) and adenine. The triphosphate moiety of RPnTP is hydrolysed to pyrophosphate and a-D-ribose-1-methylphosphonate-5-phosphate (PRPn). The C-P bond of PRPn is subsequently cleaved in a radical-based reaction producing a-D-ribose-1,2-cyclic-phosphate-5-phosphate and methane in the presence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Substantial quantities of phosphonates are produced worldwide for industrial processes, detergents, herbicides and pharmaceuticals. Our elucidation of the chemical steps for the biodegradation of alkylphosphonates shows how these compounds can be metabolized and recycled to phosphate.
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a basic protein of relative molecular mass 30,000 (Mr 30K) composed of two polypeptide chains, designated PDGF A and PDGF B. The B-chain is encoded by the c-sis gene, the cellular counterpart of the simian sarcoma virus transforming gene v-sis. The PDGF A-chain cDNA clones recently isolated and sequenced from a transformed human clonal glioma cell line represent at least two alternatively spliced transcript species differing by 69 base pairs at the C-terminus. Here we demonstrate that the normal human umbilical vein endothelial cell (EC) A chain precursor lacks the 15 carboxy-terminal, highly basic amino acids encoded by the larger tumour cell cDNA. Surprisingly, culture media from monkey kidney cells (COS) transfected with the endothelial cDNA clone contained much less mitogenic activity than media from cells transfected with the longer tumour cell-derived A-chain cDNA. This functional difference appeared to be due to inefficient assembly or secretion of the recombinant endothelial-type growth factor. This suggests that some transformed cells may use alternative RNA splicing to modify normal growth factors and by so doing increase the efficiency of mitogen assembly or secretion.
Genome sequences for most metazoans and plants are incomplete because of the presence of repeated DNA in the heterochromatin. The heterochromatic regions of Drosophila melanogaster contain 20 million bases (Mb) of sequence amenable to mapping, sequence assembly, and finishing. We describe the generation of 15 Mb of finished or improved heterochromatic sequence with the use of available clone resources and assembly methods. We also constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome-based physical map that spans 13 Mb of the pericentromeric heterochromatin and a cytogenetic map that positions 11 Mb in specific chromosomal locations. We have approached a complete assembly and mapping of the nonsatellite component of Drosophila heterochromatin. The strategy we describe is also applicable to generating substantially more information about heterochromatin in other species, including humans.
Estrogen hormones produce physiological actions within a variety of target sites in the body and during development by activating a specific receptor protein. Hormone responsiveness for the estrogen receptor protein was investigated at different stages of development with the use of gene knockout techniques because no natural genetic mutants have been described. A mutant mouse line without a functional estrogen receptor was created and is being used to assess estrogen responsiveness. Both sexes of these mutant animals are infertile and show a variety of phenotypic changes, some of which are associated with the gonads, mammary glands, reproductive tracts, and skeletal tissues.
The mutation component, M, is a measure of the proportion of the impact of a genetic condition that is attributable to recurrent mutation. For a trait maintained by balance between mutation and directional selection, M is approximately the broad-sense heritability; for a measured character where the mean and optimum coincide, M is about half the heritability. If the narrow-sense heritability is high, the impact changes relatively rapidly with a change in mutation rate. If the narrow-sense heritability is low, M cannot be predicted, but the change in impact following a change in mutation rate, if any, is very slow.
In eukaryotic cells, chromosomal DNA replication begins with the formation of pre-replication complexes at replication origins. Formation and maintenance of pre-replication complexes is dependent upon CDC6 (ref. 1), a protein which allows assembly of MCM2-7 proteins, which are putative replicative helicases. The functional assembly of MCM proteins into chromatin corresponds to replication licensing. Removal of these proteins from chromatin in S phase is crucial in origins firing regulation. We have identified a protein that is required for the assembly of pre-replication complexes, in a screen for maternally expressed genes in Xenopus. This factor (XCDT1) is a relative of fission yeast cdt1, a protein proposed to function in DNA replication, and is the first to be identified in vertebrates. Here we show, using Xenopus in vitro systems, that XCDT1 is required for chromosomal DNA replication. XCDT1 associates with pre-replicative chromatin in a manner dependent on ORC protein and is removed from chromatin at the time of initiation of DNA synthesis. Immunodepletion and reconstitution experiments show that XCDT1 is required to load MCM2-7 proteins onto pre-replicative chromatin. These findings indicate that XCDT1 is an essential component of the system that regulates origins firing during S phase.
Infection with Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of human syphilis, gives rise to a complex immune response involving both humoral and cellular components. The exact nature of this response and how it relates to the disease process is a matter of considerable speculation. In recent years, studies have been directed towards defining the role of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in syphilis. These have been conducted mainly in vitro because the general unavailability of inbred rabbits, the principal animals for experimental syphilis research, has limited the application of in vivo procedures. A prime deterrent to using mice for the study of syphilis has been their failure to exhibit pathology, even in the face of a persistent infection. We report here that on intradermal (i.d.) infection, transient primary lesions, characteristic of those seen in naturally acquired human syphilis, can be produced regularly in some strains of mice but not others, indicating a genetic basis for host susceptibility. Strains of mice which normally fail to develop lesions, do so after exposure to ionising radiation. Evidence is presented for a multiple role of the immune response during local infection.
Development of the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis is controlled by the host plant, although the underlying mechanisms have remained obscure. A mutant in the annual legume Medicago truncatula exhibits an increase of more than an order of magnitude in the number of persistent rhizobial infections. Physiological and genetic analyses indicate that this same mutation confers insensitivity to the plant hormone ethylene for multiple aspects of plant development, including nodulation. These data support the hypothesis that ethylene is a component of the signaling pathway controlling rhizobial infection of legumes.
The hsp60 protein isolated from the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila is induced in response to heat stress and is a member of an immunologically conserved family represented in Escherichia coli and in mitochondria of plants and animals. We report here the cloning and characterization of a nuclear gene, HSP60, which codes for the hsp60 homologue from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that yeast hsp60 is related to the groEL protein of E. coli and the RUBISCO-binding protein (RBP) of chloroplasts. HSP60 was found to be the genetic locus of the conditional-lethal mutation described by Cheng et al., which at non-permissive temperature is defective in the assembly of several different multisubunit complexes in mitochondria. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the groEL-related proteins serve an evolutionarily conserved function as accessory factors facilitating the folding and/or association of individual subunits of multimeric protein complexes.
In the families of manic-depressive patients, relatives with a history of affective disorders had a significantly higher ratio of mean red cell lithium to plasma lithium in vitro than relatives with no such history. A genetically controlled abnormality in lithium-sodium transport, the mechanism that determines the lithium ratio, may play a role in the etiology of some forms of affective disorders.
The impact of biodiversity loss on the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide ecological services has become a central issue in ecology. Several experiments have provided evidence that reduced species diversity may impair ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production. The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial because two types of mechanism may operate in combination. In the 'selection effect', dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the 'complementarity effect', resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.
Microorganisms populate every habitable environment on Earth and, through their metabolic activity, affect the chemistry and physical properties of their surroundings. They have done this for billions of years. Over the past decade, genetic, biochemical, and genomic approaches have allowed us to document the diversity of microbial life in geologic systems without cultivation, as well as to begin to elucidate their function. With expansion of culture-independent analyses of microbial communities, it will be possible to quantify gene activity at the species level. Genome-enabled biogeochemical modeling may provide an opportunity to determine how communities function, and how they shape and are shaped by their environments.
Speciation genes restrict gene flow between the incipient species and related taxa. Three decades ago, we mapped a mammalian speciation gene, hybrid sterility 1 (Hst1), in the intersubspecific hybrids of house mouse. Here, we identify this gene as Prdm9, encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 trimethyltransferase. We rescued infertility in male hybrids with bacterial artificial chromosomes carrying Prdm9 from a strain with the "fertility" Hst1(f) allele. Sterile hybrids display down-regulated microrchidia 2B (Morc2b) and fail to compartmentalize gammaH2AX into the pachynema sex (XY) body. These defects, seen also in Prdm9-null mutants, are rescued by the Prdm9 transgene. Identification of a vertebrate hybrid sterility gene reveals a role for epigenetics in speciation and opens a window to a hybrid sterility gene network.
It is known that some plasmids, such as RP4, can replicate in many Gram-negative bacteria. Certain small Staphylococcus aureus plasmids have an even broader host range, being able to replicate in not only phylogenetically distant Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis or Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Here we have examined whether these plasmids can also replicate in a lower eukaryote, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For this purpose we constructed hybrids between a S. aureus plasmid pC194 and an E. coli plasmid YIp5, which carries a ura-3 gene easy to select for in yeast but cannot replicate in this host. We found that the hybrids transformed yeast with high efficiency (as did hybrids between YIp5 and three other S. aureus plasmids); were maintained extrachromosomally in yeast; and were not modified during residence in yeast. We conclude from this evidence that S. aureus plasmids can replicate in yeast, which raises the questions of whether the replication signals used by prokaryotes and eukaryotes are similar, and how far up the phylogenetic tree the organisms still able to be hosts to S. aureus plasmids may be.
Despite great progress in identifying genetic variants that influence human disease, most inherited risk remains unexplained. A more complete understanding requires genome-wide studies that fully examine less common alleles in populations with a wide range of ancestry. To inform the design and interpretation of such studies, we genotyped 1.6 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,184 reference individuals from 11 global populations, and sequenced ten 100-kilobase regions in 692 of these individuals. This integrated data set of common and rare alleles, called 'HapMap 3', includes both SNPs and copy number polymorphisms (CNPs). We characterized population-specific differences among low-frequency variants, measured the improvement in imputation accuracy afforded by the larger reference panel, especially in imputing SNPs with a minor allele frequency of <or=5%, and demonstrated the feasibility of imputing newly discovered CNPs and SNPs. This expanded public resource of genome variants in global populations supports deeper interrogation of genomic variation and its role in human disease, and serves as a step towards a high-resolution map of the landscape of human genetic variation.
We are usually unaware of the motion of an image across our retina that results from our own movement. For instance, during slow-tracking eye movements we do not mistake the shift of the image projected onto the retina for motion of the world around us, but instead perceive a stable world. Following early suggestions by von Helmholtz, it is commonly believed that this spatial stability is achieved by subtracting the retinal motion signal from an internal reference signal, such as a copy of the movement command (efference copy). Object motion is perceived only if the two differ. Although this concept is widely accepted, its anatomical underpinning remains unknown. Here we describe the case of a patient with bilateral extrastriate cortex lesions, suffering from false perception of motion due to an inability to take eye movements into account when faced with self-induced retinal image slip. This is indicated by the fact that during smooth-pursuit eye movements, he perceives motion of the stationary world at a velocity that corresponds to the velocity of his eye movement; that is, he perceives the raw retinal image slip uncorrected for his own eye movements. We suspect that this deficiency reflects damage of a distinct parieto-occipital region that disentangles self-induced and externally induced visual motion by comparing retinal signals with a reference signal encoding eye movements and possibly ego-motion in general.
P elements are transposable elements found in P strain, but usually not in M strain, Drosophila melanogaster, and are responsible for the hybrid dysgenesis that occurs when male D. melanogaster of the P strain mate with females of the M strain (ref. 1 and references therein). Several P elements, which vary in length and genetic effects, have now been cloned. To investigate the evolutionary origin of P elements, we have used a cloned copy of a D. melanogaster P element to look for related sequences in the genomes of six other Drosophila species. We report here that, unlike many other transposable elements found in D. melanogaster, which seem also to be present in other Drosophila species, we have found no sequences closely enough related to P elements to be detected by DNA hybridization in any other Drosophila species. This result supports the hypothesis that P elements have recently invaded D. melanogaster by horizontal transmission.
Somatic cell hybrids have been made between an established human cell line with a long culture history and established mouse fibroblast line. When first analyzed, the hybrid cells contained nearly twice as many mouse chromosomes as the mouse parent line and a human chromosome complemnent of about half that of the human parent. There was further loss of human chromosomes on continued cultivation. This behavior resembles that of other human mouse hybrids and appears to be characteristic of the human-mouse combination. However, the number of human chromosomes is greater than in hybrids made from human diploid fibroblasts. Some clones contain more than a haptoid quantity of human DNA per cell and should synthesize a much greater number of human gene products.
An esterase gene from the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus that is responsible for resistance to a variety of organophosphorus (OP) insecticides was cloned in lambda gt11 phage. This gene was used to investigate the genetic mechanism of the high production of the esterase B1 it encodes in OP-resistant Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Tem-R strain) from California. Adults of the Tem-R strain were found to possess at least 250 times more copies of the gene than adults of a susceptible strain (S-Lab). The finding that selection by pesticides may result in the amplification of genes encoding detoxifying enzymes in whole, normally developed, reproducing insects emphasizes the biological importance of this mechanism and opens new areas of investigation in pesticide resistance management.
Alternative splicing of precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) is a common mechanism of regulating gene expression. SR proteins are a family of pre-mRNA splicing factors that are structurally related and evolutionarily conserved. Any member of the SR family can complement a splicing-deficient extract that lacks the entire family of SR proteins. Here it is demonstrated that particular SR proteins have distinct functions in alternative pre-mRNA splicing in vitro. In addition, SR proteins are differentially expressed in a variety of tissues. These results suggest a fundamental role for SR proteins in the regulation of alternative splicing.
The development of the vertebrate limb serves as an amenable system for studying signaling pathways that lead to tissue patterning and proliferation. Limbs originate as a consequence of a differential growth of cells from the lateral plate mesoderm at specific axial levels. At the tip of the limb primordia the progress zone, a proliferating group of mesenchymal cells, induces the overlying ectoderm to differentiate into a specialized structure termed the apical ectodermal ridge. Subsequent limb outgrowth requires reciprocal signalling between the ridge and the progress zone. The Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors is induced in response to several signals that lead to cell growth, differentiation, inflammatory responses, apoptosis and neoplastic transformation. In unstimulated cells, NF-kappaB is associated in the cytoplasm with an inhibitory protein, I-kappaB. In response to an external signal, I-kappaB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and degraded, releasing NF-kappaB to enter the nucleus and activate transcription. Here we show that Rel/NF-kappaB genes are expressed in the progress zone of the developing chick limb bud. When the activity of Rel/NF-kappaB proteins is blocked by infection with viral vectors that produce transdominant-negative I-kappaBalpha proteins, limb outgrowth is arrested. Our results indicate that Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors play a role in vertebrate limb development.
The population vector hypothesis was introduced almost twenty years ago to illustrate that a population vector constructed from neural activity in primary motor cortex (MI) of non-human primates could predict the direction of hand movement during reaching. Alternative explanations for this population signal have been suggested but could not be tested experimentally owing to movement complexity in the standard reaching model. We re-examined this issue by recording the activity of neurons in contralateral MI of monkeys while they made reaching movements with their right arms oriented in the horizontal plane-where the mechanics of limb motion are measurable and anisotropic. Here we found systematic biases between the population vector and the direction of hand movement. These errors were attributed to a non-uniform distribution of preferred directions of neurons and the non-uniformity covaried with peak joint power at the shoulder and elbow. These observations contradict the population vector hypothesis and show that non-human primates are capable of generating reaching movements to spatial targets even though population vectors based on MI activity do not point in the direction of hand motion.
The genetic distinction between the nonspotted, or burnsi, mutant and the common-spotted, wild-type leopard frog is not simply unifactorial. The burnsi phenotype is a manifestation of genic interaction between a major pigmentary locus and a complex of modifiers (minor genes with small effects).
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is widely believed to be an autoimmune disease. Recent onset diabetics show destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells associated with a lymphocytic infiltrate (insulitis), with autoantibodies to beta-cells being found even before the onset of symptoms. Susceptibility to the disease is strongly influenced by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II polymorphism in both man and experimental animal models such as the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. As MHC class II molecules are usually associated with dominant immune responsiveness, it was surprising that introduction of a transgenic class II molecule, I-E, protected NOD mice from insulitis and diabetes. This could be explained by a change either in the target tissue or in the T cells presumed to be involved in beta-cell destruction. Recently, several studies have shown that I-E molecules are associated with ontogenetic deletion of T cells bearing antigen/MHC receptors encoded in part by certain T-cell receptor V beta gene segments. To determine the mechanism of the protective effect of I-E, we have produced cloned CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lines from islets of recently diabetic NOD mice. These cloned lines are islet-specific and pathogenic in both I-E- and I-E+ mice. Both CD4+ and CD8+ cloned T cells bear receptors encoded by a V beta 5 gene segment, known to be deleted during development in I-E expressing mice. Our data provide, therefore, an explanation for the puzzling effect of I-E on susceptibility to diabetes in NOD mice.
The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins mediate cell cell interactions during cell growth and differentiation in both embryos and adults. Canonical Wnt signalling by way of the beta-catenin pathway is transduced by two receptor families. Frizzled proteins and lipoprotein-receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) bind Wnts and transmit their signal by stabilizing intracellular beta-catenin. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is inhibited by the secreted protein Dickkopf1 (Dkk1), a member of a multigene family, which induces head formation in amphibian embryos. Dkk1 has been shown to inhibit Wnt signalling by binding to and antagonizing LRP5/6. Here we show that the transmembrane proteins Kremen1 and Kremen2 are high-affinity Dkk1 receptors that functionally cooperate with Dkk1 to block Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Kremen2 forms a ternary complex with Dkk1 and LRP6, and induces rapid endocytosis and removal of the Wnt receptor LRP6 from the plasma membrane. The results indicate that Kremen1 and Kremen2 are components of a membrane complex modulating canonical Wnt signalling through LRP6 in vertebrates.
Plants elaborate a vast array of natural products, many of which have evolved to confer selective advantage against microbial attack. Recent advances in molecular technology, aided by the enormous power of large-scale genomics initiatives, are leading to a more complete understanding of the enzymatic machinery that underlies the often complex pathways of plant natural product biosynthesis. Meanwhile, genetic and reverse genetic approaches are providing evidence for the importance of natural products in host defence. Metabolic engineering of natural product pathways is now a feasible strategy for enhancement of plant disease resistance.
Honey bee queens mate with many males, creating numerous patrilines within colonies that are genetically distinct. The effects of genetic diversity on colony productivity and long-term fitness are unknown. We show that swarms from genetically diverse colonies (15 patrilines per colony) founded new colonies faster than swarms from genetically uniform colonies (1 patriline per colony). Accumulated differences in foraging rates, food storage, and population growth led to impressive boosts in the fitness (i.e., drone production and winter survival) of genetically diverse colonies. These results further our understanding of the origins of polyandry in honey bees and its benefits for colony performance.
Incipient manganese concretions occur in microcavities of planktonic skeletal debris (especially diatom frustules) in some Pacific Basin deep-sea sediments. These concretions contain over 50 percent manganese and very little iron (< 1 percent). There is a continuum of growth stages in the concretions having a diameter between 0 and approximately 2 millimeters, and a genetic relationship is suggested between the very small and the centimeter sized concretions.
As part of the viral infection cycle, viruses must package their newly replicated genomes for delivery to other host cells. Bacteriophage straight phi29 packages its 6.6-microm long, double-stranded DNA into a 42 x 54 nm capsid by means of a portal complex that hydrolyses ATP. This process is remarkable because entropic, electrostatic and bending energies of the DNA must be overcome to package the DNA to near-crystalline density. Here we use optical tweezers to pull on single DNA molecules as they are packaged, thus demonstrating that the portal complex is a force-generating motor. This motor can work against loads of up to 57 pN on average, making it one of the strongest molecular motors reported to date. Movements of over 5 microm are observed, indicating high processivity. Pauses and slips also occur, particularly at higher forces. We establish the force-velocity relationship of the motor and find that the rate-limiting step of the motor's cycle is force dependent even at low loads. Notably, the packaging rate decreases as the prohead is filled, indicating that an internal force builds up to approximately 50 pN owing to DNA confinement. Our data suggest that this force may be available for initiating the ejection of the DNA from the capsid during infection.
The large chlorella virus PBCV-1, which contains double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), encodes a 94-codon open reading frame (ORF) that contains a motif resembling the signature sequence of the pore domain of potassium channel proteins. Phylogenetic analyses of the encoded protein, Kcv, indicate a previously unidentified type of potassium channel. The messenger RNA encoded by the ORF leads to functional expression of a potassium-selective conductance in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The channel blockers amantadine and barium, but not cesium, inhibit this conductance, in addition to virus plaque formation. Thus, PBCV-1 encodes the first known viral protein that functions as a potassium-selective channel and is essential in the virus life cycle.
Mutagenesis was studied in cultured F9 embryonal carcinoma cells infected with a variant of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Proviral insertion induced the inactivation of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase locus, and the virus was used to isolate the mutated genes rapidly. Mutagenesis by these methods may be useful for the genetic dissection of the various mammalian cell phenotypes.
A gene, ATM, that is mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT) was identified by positional cloning on chromosome 11q22-23. AT is characterized by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, chromosomal instability, cancer predisposition, radiation sensitivity, and cell cycle abnormalities. The disease is genetically heterogeneous, with four complementation groups that have been suspected to represent different genes. ATM, which has a transcript of 12 kilobases, was found to be mutated in AT patients from all complementation groups, indicating that it is probably the sole gene responsible for this disorder. A partial ATM complementary DNA clone of 5.9 kilobases encoded a putative protein that is similar to several yeast and mammalian phosphatidylinositol-3' kinases that are involved in mitogenic signal transduction, meiotic recombination, and cell cycle control. The discovery of ATM should enhance understanding of AT and related syndromes and may allow the identification of AT heterozygotes, who are at increased risk of cancer.
Analyses of data obtained from 662 unwed couples whose children were relinquished for adoption reveal that biological parents of adopted children mate assortatively. For physical characters, assortative mating of unwed parents was similar to that of wed parents; for behavior characters, however, there was less assortative mating by the unwed parents. Because assortative mating inflates estimates of genetic parameters in adoption studies, future studies should collect information on both biological parents.
Escherichia coli that has been genetically manipulated by recombinant DNA technology to synthesize human insulin polypeptides (A chain, B chain, or proinsulin) contains prominent cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. The amount of inclusion product within the cells corresponds to the quantity of chimeric protein formed by the bacteria. At peak production, the inclusion bodies may occupy as much as 20 percent of the Escherichia coli cellular volume.
The Arabidopsis gene DDM1 is required to maintain DNA methylation levels and is responsible for transposon and transgene silencing. However, rather than encoding a DNA methyltransferase, DDM1 has similarity to the SWI/SNF family of adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling genes, suggesting an indirect role in DNA methylation. Here we show that DDM1 is also required to maintain histone H3 methylation patterns. In wild-type heterochromatin, transposons and silent genes are associated with histone H3 methylated at lysine 9, whereas known genes are preferentially associated with methylated lysine 4. In ddm1 heterochromatin, DNA methylation is lost, and methylation of lysine 9 is largely replaced by methylation of lysine 4. Because DNA methylation has recently been shown to depend on histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, our results suggest that transposon methylation may be guided by histone H3 methylation in plant genomes. This would account for the epigenetic inheritance of hypomethylated DNA once histone H3 methylation patterns are altered.
Mobile genetic elements have been identified in several eukaryotic organisms and some classes have been found to share common structural features with the proviral forms of animal retroviruses. The representatives of this class of mobile elements in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are called Ty elements, which could be a useful model system for studying the transposition of retrovirus-like elements. Here we have attempted to answer two questions often raised in discussions of the biological importance of transposition: what is the frequency of spontaneous Ty transposition, and are there certain chromosomal regions into which Ty elements preferentially integrate? We chose the LYS2 gene to investigate these questions because it allows direct selection of both mutants and revertants. We have found that 2% of spontaneous lys2 mutants are caused by Ty transposition with a preferential integration into the transcription initiation region.
The pathogenesis of asthma reflects, in part, the activity of T cell cytokines. Murine models support participation of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and the IL-4 receptor in asthma. Selective neutralization of IL-13, a cytokine related to IL-4 that also binds to the alpha chain of the IL-4 receptor, ameliorated the asthma phenotype, including airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophil recruitment, and mucus overproduction. Administration of either IL-13 or IL-4 conferred an asthma-like phenotype to nonimmunized T cell-deficient mice by an IL-4 receptor alpha chain-dependent pathway. This pathway may underlie the genetic associations of asthma with both the human 5q31 locus and the IL-4 receptor.
High energy efficiency and energy density, together with rapid refuelling capability, render fuel cells highly attractive for portable power generation. Accordingly, polymer-electrolyte direct-methanol fuel cells are of increasing interest as possible alternatives to Li ion batteries. However, such fuel cells face several design challenges and cannot operate with hydrocarbon fuels of higher energy density. Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) enable direct use of higher hydrocarbons, but have not been seriously considered for portable applications because of thermal management difficulties at small scales, slow start-up and poor thermal cyclability. Here we demonstrate a thermally self-sustaining micro-SOFC stack with high power output and rapid start-up by using single chamber operation on propane fuel. The catalytic oxidation reactions supply sufficient thermal energy to maintain the fuel cells at 500-600 degrees C. A power output of approximately 350 mW (at 1.0 V) was obtained from a device with a total cathode area of only 1.42 cm2.
"Amyloid" fibrils have been created from some human Bence Jones proteins by proteolytic digestion under physiologic conditions. These fibrils with an antiparallel, beta-pleated sheet conformation consist of only a portion of the variable region of the immunoglobulin light polypeptide chain and share the physical properties of amyloid fibrils. The relation between amyloidosis and immunoglobulins is thus more firmly established and a pathogenetic mechanism for amyloid fibril formation is suggested.
Nuclear receptors for retinoids (RARs) and vitamin D (VDR), and for some other ligands (TRs, PPARs and LXRs), maybe critical in the development and homeostasis of mammalian epidermis. It is believed that these receptors form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to act as transcriptional regulators. However, most genetic approaches aimed at establishing their physiological functions in the skin have been inconclusive owing either to pleiotropic effects and redundancies between receptor isotypes in gene knockouts, or to equivocal interpretation of dominant-negative mutant studies in transgenic mice. Moreover, knockout of RXRalpha, the main skin RXR isotype, is lethal in utero before skin formation. Here we have resolved these problems by developing an efficient technique to create spatiotemporally controlled somatic mutations in the mouse. We used tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER(T) recombinases to ablate RXRalpha selectively in adult mouse keratinocytes. We show that RXRalpha has key roles in hair cycling, probably through RXR/VDR heterodimers, and in epidermal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation.
Theory predicts that linkage between genetic loci reduces the efficiency of purifying selection. Because of the permanent linkage of all heritable genetic material, asexual lineages may be exceptionally prone to deleterious-mutation accumulation in both nuclear and organelle genes. Here, we show that the ratio of the rate of amino acid to silent substitution (Ka/Ks) in mitochondrial protein-coding genes is higher in obligately asexual lineages than in sexual lineages of the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex. Using a phylogeny-based approach to quantify the frequency of mutational-effect classes, we estimate that mitochondrial protein-coding genes in asexual lineages accumulate deleterious amino acid substitutions at four times the rate in sexual lineages. These results support the hypothesis that sexual reproduction plays a prominent role in reducing the mutational burden in populations.
Liver and pancreas progenitors develop from endoderm cells in the embryonic foregut. Shortly after their specification, liver and pancreas progenitors rapidly acquire markedly different cellular functions and regenerative capacities. These changes are elicited by inductive signals and genetic regulatory factors that are highly conserved among vertebrates. Interest in the development and regeneration of the organs has been fueled by the intense need for hepatocytes and pancreatic beta cells in the therapeutic treatment of liver failure and type I diabetes. Studies in diverse model organisms have revealed evolutionarily conserved inductive signals and transcription factor networks that elicit the differentiation of liver and pancreatic cells and provide guidance for how to promote hepatocyte and beta cell differentiation from diverse stem and progenitor cell types.
Attempts to place Palaeolithic finds within a precise climatic framework are complicated by both uncertainty over the radiocarbon calibration beyond about 21,500 14C years bp and the absence of a master calendar chronology for climate events from reference archives such as Greenland ice cores or speleothems. Here we present an alternative approach, in which 14C dates of interest are mapped directly onto the palaeoclimate record of the Cariaco Basin by means of its 14C series, circumventing calendar age model and correlation uncertainties, and placing dated events in the millennial-scale climate context of the last glacial period. This is applied to different sets of dates from levels with Mousterian artefacts, presumably produced by late Neanderthals, from Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar: first, generally accepted estimates of about 32,000 14C years bp for the uppermost Mousterian levels; second, a possible extended Middle Palaeolithic occupation until about 28,000 14C years bp; and third, more contentious evidence for persistence until about 24,000 14C years bp. This study shows that the three sets translate to different scenarios on the role of climate in Neanderthal extinction. The first two correspond to intervals of general climatic instability between stadials and interstadials that characterized most of the Middle Pleniglacial and are not coeval with Heinrich Events. In contrast, if accepted, the youngest date indicates that late Neanderthals may have persisted up to the onset of a major environmental shift, which included an expansion in global ice volume and an increased latitudinal temperature gradient. More generally, our radiocarbon climatostratigraphic approach can be applied to any 'snapshot' date from discontinuous records in a variety of deposits and can become a powerful tool in evaluating the climatic signature of critical intervals in Late Pleistocene human evolution.
Malaria is a devastating public health menace, killing over one million people every year and infecting about half a billion. Here it is shown that the protozoan Plasmodium gallinaceum, a close relative of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, can develop in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Plasmodium gallinaceum ookinetes injected into the fly developed into sporozoites infectious to the vertebrate host with similar kinetics as seen in the mosquito host Aedes aegypti. In the fly, a component of the insect's innate immune system, the macrophage, can destroy Plasmodia. These experiments suggest that Drosophila can be used as a surrogate mosquito for defining the genetic pathways involved in both vector competence and part of the parasite sexual cycle.
The ability of transposable elements (TEs) to insert into or excise out of a genetic locus can be regulated by genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Tissue- or organ-specific activity of TEs is a frequent and well-characterized example of spatial, developmental regulation. Regulation of the timing of TE activity during ontogeny is less well understood. To analyze timing, TE-induced variegation was quantified in the aleurone of maize kernels, a tissue composed of only a single layer of cells, and sector sizes were assigned to specific cell divisions in aleurone development. Three TE families, Mu, Spm, and Ac/Ds, were studied at two genetic loci. It was found that the frequency of transposon excision changes drastically (up to 30-fold increase or equivalent decrease) during the proliferation of the aleurone. Moreover, these changes occur at the same cell divisions in all three TE families. These results suggest that the timing of TE excision during maize development can be controlled by the host.
In 1977, a unique event occurred in the epidemiology of influenza when a virus of the influenza A (H1N1) subtype, similar to a virus that had occurred in 1950, reappeared and caused worldwide epidemics but did not replace the prevailing influenza A (H2N2) subtype. Consequently, the two viruses co-circulated throughout the world and mixed infection of some individuals with both virus strains was detected, raising the possiblitity that recombination between the two strains might affect the future epidemiological behaviour of influenza. Serological analysis of virus isolates from influenza outbreaks during the winter of 1978-79, however, failed to detect any antigenic hybrids (H2N1 or H1N2). The investigation described here, was therefore, undertaken to detect recombinants among recent isolates of the H1N1 and H3N1 serotypes, involving genes coding for other than the surface proteins by RNA-RNA hybridisation. We report here the genetic characterisation of recombinants of both antigenic types.
Reproductive isolation is induced by microorganisms in diverse geographic strains of the flour beetle Tribolium confusum (Coleoptera:Tenebrionidae). The incompatibility between populations is due to nongenetic cytoplasmically inherited factors. Males of infected strains produce no progeny when crossed with females of noninfected strains; however, they produce "normal" numbers of progeny when crossed with infected females. Males from noninfected strains show no reproductive isolation. Infected strains of T. confusum can be cured when tetracycline or other antibiotics are added to the flour medium. "Cured" strains become partially reproductively isolated from all noncured strains including the source strain
Although it is generally agreed that stromal cells are important in the regulation of haematopoietic cell development, the origin of these phenotypically diverse cells has been a subject for debate for more than 50 years. Data which support the concept of a separate origin for the haematopoietic stem cell and the marrow stroma are derived from cytogenetic or enzyme marker studies of explanted and expanded stromal cells grown under conditions that do not allow haematopoiesis in vitro. Recent evidence in man and in mouse suggesting that the stromal cells capable of transferring the haematopoietic microenvironment in vitro are transplantable seemingly questions this dichotomy, one interpretation being the existence of a common haematopoietic/stromal 'stem cell'. We used in situ hybridization to discriminate donor cells from host in blood and bone marrow samples obtained from patients with functioning sex-mismatched but HLA-identical allografts. Without exception, marrow-derived stromal cells that proliferate in long-term cultures were found to be of host genotype, whereas the macrophage component of the adherent layer in these cultures originated from the donor.
The origin of the Andaman "Negrito" and Nicobar "Mongoloid" populations has been ambiguous. Our analyses of complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from Onges and Great Andaman populations revealed two deeply branching clades that share their most recent common ancestor in founder haplogroup M, with lineages spread among India, Africa, East Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. This distribution suggests that these two clades have likely survived in genetic isolation since the initial settlement of the islands during an out-of-Africa migration by anatomically modern humans. In contrast, Nicobarese sequences illustrate a close genetic relationship with populations from Southeast Asia.
Mammalian mitochondria contain about 1100 proteins, nearly 300 of which are uncharacterized. Given the well-established role of mitochondrial defects in human disease, functional characterization of these proteins may shed new light on disease mechanisms. Starting with yeast as a model system, we investigated an uncharacterized but highly conserved mitochondrial protein (named here Sdh5). Both yeast and human Sdh5 interact with the catalytic subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, a component of both the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Sdh5 is required for SDH-dependent respiration and for Sdh1 flavination (incorporation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor). Germline loss-of-function mutations in the human SDH5 gene, located on chromosome 11q13.1, segregate with disease in a family with hereditary paraganglioma, a neuroendocrine tumor previously linked to mutations in genes encoding SDH subunits. Thus, a mitochondrial proteomics analysis in yeast has led to the discovery of a human tumor susceptibility gene.
The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the H5N1 subtype in Asia, which has subsequently spread to Russia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa, has put increased focus on the role of wild birds in the persistence of influenza viruses. The ecology, epidemiology, genetics, and evolution of pathogens cannot be fully understood without taking into account the ecology of their hosts. Here, we review our current knowledge on global patterns of influenza virus infections in wild birds, discuss these patterns in the context of host ecology and in particular birds' behavior, and identify some important gaps in our current knowledge.
cytosis of cellular corpses. During apoptosis, the asymmetry of plasma membrane phospholipids is lost, which exposes phosphatidylserine externally. The phagocytosis of apoptotic cells can be inhibited stereospecifically by phosphatidylserine and its structural analogues, but not by other anionic phospholipids, suggesting that phosphatidylserine is specifically recognized. Using phage display, we have cloned a gene that appears to recognize phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. Here we show that this gene, when transfected into B and T lymphocytes, enables them to recognize and engulf apoptotic cells in a phosphatidylserine-specific manner. Flow cytometric analysis using a monoclonal antibody suggested that the protein is expressed on the surface of macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells; this antibody, like phosphatidylserine liposomes, inhibited the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and, in macrophages, induced an anti-inflammatory state. This candidate phosphatidylserine receptor is highly homologous to genes of unknown function in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that phosphatidylserine recognition on apoptotic cells during their removal by phagocytes is highly conserved throughout phylogeny.
The function of plant genomes depends on chromatin marks such as the methylation of DNA and the post-translational modification of histones. Techniques for studying model plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana have enabled researchers to begin to uncover the pathways that establish and maintain chromatin modifications, and genomic studies are allowing the mapping of modifications such as DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale. Small RNAs seem to be important in determining the distribution of chromatin modifications, and RNA might also underlie the complex epigenetic interactions that occur between homologous sequences. Plants use these epigenetic silencing mechanisms extensively to control development and parent-of-origin imprinted gene expression.
A transposable genetic element of the P family in Drosophila melanogaster was found to be unstable in the presence of other P elements but stable in their absence. A sensitive assay for P transpositional activity is provided by the snw allele, a defective P insert in the singed bristle locus which becomes hypermutable only in the presence of complete elements. This measure of activity was highly correlated with a type of female sterility normally associated with P activity. There was no cross-reactivity with transposase from another hybrid dysgenesis-causing element (the I factor).
The ancestors of fungi are believed to be simple aquatic forms with flagellated spores, similar to members of the extant phylum Chytridiomycota (chytrids). Current classifications assume that chytrids form an early-diverging clade within the kingdom Fungi and imply a single loss of the spore flagellum, leading to the diversification of terrestrial fungi. Here we develop phylogenetic hypotheses for Fungi using data from six gene regions and nearly 200 species. Our results indicate that there may have been at least four independent losses of the flagellum in the kingdom Fungi. These losses of swimming spores coincided with the evolution of new mechanisms of spore dispersal, such as aerial dispersal in mycelial groups and polar tube eversion in the microsporidia (unicellular forms that lack mitochondria). The enigmatic microsporidia seem to be derived from an endoparasitic chytrid ancestor similar to Rozella allomycis, on the earliest diverging branch of the fungal phylogenetic tree.
A strain of pigs bearing three immunogenetically defined lipoprotein-associated markers (allotypes), designated Lpb5, Lpr1, and Lpu1, has marked hypercholesterolemia on a low fat, cholesterol-free diet. Unlike individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia or WHHL rabbits, the affected pigs have normal low density lipoprotein receptor activity. The animals, by 7 months of age, have extensive atherosclerotic lesions in all three coronary arteries. This strain of pig represents an animal model for atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia associated with mutations affecting the structures of plasma lipoproteins. One of the variant apolipoproteins, Lpb5, is apolipoprotein-B. A second variant apolipoprotein (Lpr1), termed apo-R, is a 23-kilodalton protein present in both the very low density (d less than 1.006 g/ml) and the very high density (d greater than 1.21 g/ml) fractions of pig plasma. Isoforms of this protein correlate with two Lpr alleles, Lpr1 and Lpr2. The Lpr genes segregate independently of the Lpb5 and Lpu1 alleles. The Lpu1 allotype is a component of low density lipoprotein and is genetically linked to Lpb5.
The history of human population size is important for understanding human evolution. Various studies have found evidence for a founder event (bottleneck) in East Asian and European populations, associated with the human dispersal out-of-Africa event around 60 thousand years (kyr) ago. However, these studies have had to assume simplified demographic models with few parameters, and they do not provide a precise date for the start and stop times of the bottleneck. Here, with fewer assumptions on population size changes, we present a more detailed history of human population sizes between approximately ten thousand and a million years ago, using the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent model applied to the complete diploid genome sequences of a Chinese male (YH), a Korean male (SJK), three European individuals (J. C. Venter, NA12891 and NA12878 (ref. 9)) and two Yoruba males (NA18507 (ref. 10) and NA19239). We infer that European and Chinese populations had very similar population-size histories before 10-20 kyr ago. Both populations experienced a severe bottleneck 10-60 kyr ago, whereas African populations experienced a milder bottleneck from which they recovered earlier. All three populations have an elevated effective population size between 60 and 250 kyr ago, possibly due to population substructure. We also infer that the differentiation of genetically modern humans may have started as early as 100-120 kyr ago, but considerable genetic exchanges may still have occurred until 20-40 kyr ago.
Adenovirus e1a induces quiescent human cells to replicate. We found that e1a causes global relocalization of the RB (retinoblastoma) proteins (RB, p130, and p107) and p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases on promoters, the effect of which is to restrict the acetylation of histone 3 lysine-18 (H3K18ac) to a limited set of genes, thereby stimulating cell cycling and inhibiting antiviral responses and cellular differentiation. Soon after expression, e1a binds transiently to promoters of cell cycle and growth genes, causing enrichment of p300/CBP, PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor), and H3K18ac; depletion of RB proteins; and transcriptional activation. e1a also associates transiently with promoters of antiviral genes, causing enrichment for RB, p130, and H4K16ac; increased nucleosome density; and transcriptional repression. At later times, e1a and p107 bind mainly to promoters of development and differentiation genes, repressing transcription. The temporal order of e1a binding requires its interactions with p300/CBP and RB proteins. Our data uncover a defined epigenetic reprogramming leading to cellular transformation.
The availability of complete genomic sequences and technologies that allow comprehensive analysis of global expression profiles of messenger RNA have greatly expanded our ability to monitor the internal state of a cell. Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins--and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80% of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 10(6) molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon bias measurements.
Hedgehog signalling--an essential pathway during embryonic pancreatic development, the misregulation of which has been implicated in several forms of cancer--may also be an important mediator in human pancreatic carcinoma. Here we report that sonic hedgehog, a secreted hedgehog ligand, is abnormally expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions: pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Pancreata of Pdx-Shh mice (in which Shh is misexpressed in the pancreatic endoderm) develop abnormal tubular structures, a phenocopy of human PanIN-1 and -2. Moreover, these PanIN-like lesions also contain mutations in K-ras and overexpress HER-2/neu, which are genetic mutations found early in the progression of human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, hedgehog signalling remains active in cell lines established from primary and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Notably, inhibition of hedgehog signalling by cyclopamine induced apoptosis and blocked proliferation in a subset of the pancreatic cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that this pathway may have an early and critical role in the genesis of this cancer, and that maintenance of hedgehog signalling is important for aberrant proliferation and tumorigenesis.
Anomalocaridids, giant lightly sclerotized invertebrate predators, occur in a number of exceptionally preserved early and middle Cambrian (542-501 million years ago) biotas and have come to symbolize the unfamiliar morphologies displayed by stem organisms in faunas of the Burgess Shale type. They are characterized by a pair of anterior, segmented appendages, a circlet of plates around the mouth, and an elongate segmented trunk lacking true tergites with a pair of flexible lateral lobes per segment. Disarticulated body parts, such as the anterior appendages and oral circlet, had been assigned to a range of taxonomic groups--but the discovery of complete specimens from the middle Cambrian Burgess Shale showed that these disparate elements all belong to a single kind of animal. Phylogenetic analyses support a position of anomalocaridids in the arthropod stem, as a sister group to the euarthropods. The anomalocaridids were the largest animals in Cambrian communities. The youngest unequivocal examples occur in the middle Cambrian Marjum Formation of Utah but an arthropod retaining some anomalocaridid characteristics is present in the Devonian of Germany. Here we report the post-Cambrian occurrence of anomalocaridids, from the Early Ordovician (488-472 million years ago) Fezouata Biota in southeastern Morocco, including specimens larger than any in Cambrian biotas. These giant animals were an important element of some marine communities for about 30 million years longer than previously realized. The Moroccan specimens confirm the presence of a dorsal array of flexible blades attached to a transverse rachis on the trunk segments; these blades probably functioned as gills.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are bone-derived factors capable of inducing ectopic bone formation. Unlike other BMPs, BMP-1 is not like transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), but it is the prototype of a family of putative proteases implicated in pattern formation during development in diverse organisms. Although some members of this group, such as Drosophila tolloid (TLD), are postulated to activate TGF-beta-like proteins, actual substrates are unknown. Procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) cleaves the COOH-propeptides of procollagens I, II, and III to yield the major fibrous components of vertebrate extracellular matrix. Here it is shown that BMP-1 and PCP are identical. This demonstration of enzymatic activity for a BMP-1/TLD-like protein links an enzyme involved in matrix deposition to genes involved in pattern formation.
Although AKT1 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1) kinase is a central member of possibly the most frequently activated proliferation and survival pathway in cancer, mutation of AKT1 has not been widely reported. Here we report the identification of a somatic mutation in human breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers that results in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 17 (E17K) in the lipid-binding pocket of AKT1. Lys 17 alters the electrostatic interactions of the pocket and forms new hydrogen bonds with a phosphoinositide ligand. This mutation activates AKT1 by means of pathological localization to the plasma membrane, stimulates downstream signalling, transforms cells and induces leukaemia in mice. This mechanism indicates a direct role of AKT1 in human cancer, and adds to the known genetic alterations that promote oncogenesis through the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT pathway. Furthermore, the E17K substitution decreases the sensitivity to an allosteric kinase inhibitor, so this mutation may have important clinical utility for AKT drug development.
ABC transporters (also known as traffic ATPases) form a large family of proteins responsible for the translocation of a variety of compounds across membranes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The recently completed Escherichia coli genome sequence revealed that the largest family of paralogous E. coli proteins is composed of ABC transporters. Many eukaryotic proteins of medical significance belong to this family, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the P-glycoprotein (or multidrug-resistance protein) and the heterodimeric transporter associated with antigen processing (Tap1-Tap2). Here we report the crystal structure at 1.5 A resolution of HisP, the ATP-binding subunit of the histidine permease, which is an ABC transporter from Salmonella typhimurium. We correlate the details of this structure with the biochemical, genetic and biophysical properties of the wild-type and several mutant HisP proteins. The structure provides a basis for understanding properties of ABC transporters and of defective CFTR proteins.
Evidence suggests that the New World was colonized only 11,000-40,000 years ago by Palaeo-Indians. The descendants of these Palaeo-Indians therefore provide a unique opportunity to study the effects of selection on major histocompatibility complex class I genes over a short period. Here we analyse the class I alleles of the Waorani of South America and the Zuni of North America. Four of the Waorani HLA-B alleles were new functional variants which could be accounted for by intralocus recombination. In contrast, all of the Zuni HLA-A and -B molecules were present in caucasians and orientals. This suggests that the new Waorani HLA-B variants arose in South America. The description of four new HLA-B alleles in the Waorani and another five new HLA-B alleles from two other tribes of South American Amerindians indicates that the HLA-B locus can evolve rapidly in isolated populations. These studies underline the importance of gathering genetic data on endangered native human populations.
Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA have revealed that genetic exchanges can occur between populations, subspecies or even species. From the point of view of population genetics the mammalian Y chromosome represents a genomic analogue of the mitochondrion; it is inherited only paternally and remains perpetually monosomic, showing little meiotic recombination with other chromosomes. Using a Y-specific genomic DNA probe obtained from a flow-sorted mouse Y-chromosome library, we have examined the RFLPs in 10 newly established mouse lines of the European semispecies Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus, and identified two variant forms of the Y chromosome, each of which is characteristic of one of the semispecies. As reported here, probing the DNA from nine established inbred laboratory strains reveals that the strain SJL carries a M.m. domesticus type Y whereas, surprisingly, the Y chromosomes of the other eight strains are of M.m. musculus origin. Hence, these strains cannot be regarded as archetypes of M.m. domesticus as suggested by protein polymorphisms and mitochrondrial DNA sequence data, but rather as genetic hybrids between the two semispecies.
Although humans and their closest evolutionary relatives, the chimpanzees, are 98.7% identical in their genomic DNA sequences, they differ in many morphological, behavioral, and cognitive aspects. The underlying genetic basis of many of these differences may be altered gene expression. We have compared the transcriptome in blood leukocytes, liver, and brain of humans, chimpanzees, orangutans, and macaques using microarrays, as well as protein expression patterns of humans and chimpanzees using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We also studied three mouse species that are approximately as related to each other as are humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans. We identified species-specific gene expression patterns indicating that changes in protein and gene expression have been particularly pronounced in the human brain.
DNA has been successfully isolated from both fossilized plant and animal tissues. The oldest material, dated as 25-40 million years old (Tertiary), was obtained from amber-entombed bees and termites. Tissues from both these insects yielded DNA of good quality, which could be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequently sequenced, including the genes encoding 18S ribosomal RNA and 16S rRNA. We report here the extraction of DNA from a 120-135-million-year-old weevil (Nemonychidae, Coleoptera) found in Lebanese amber, PCR amplification of segments of the 18S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer, and the corresponding nucleotide sequences of their 315- and 226-base-pair fragments, respectively. These sequences were used for preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the nemonychid's sequence with three extant coleopterans: Lecontellus pinicola (Nemonychidae), Hypera brunneipennis (Curculionidae) and the mealworm Tenebrio molitor (Tenebrionidae), and two extant dipterans: the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophilidae) and mosquito Aedes albopictus (Culicidae) for the purpose of ascertaining the origin of the extracted and amplified DNA. The results revealed that the PCR-amplified material is that of the extinct nemonychid weevil. This represents the oldest fossil DNA ever extracted and sequenced, extending by 80 million years the age of any previously reported DNA.
Expression of multiple oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressors is required to transform primary mammalian cells into cancer cells. Activated Ha-RasV12 (Ras) is usually associated with cancer, but it also produces paradoxical premature senescence in primary cells by inducing reactive oxygen species followed by accumulation of tumour suppressors p53 and p16(INK4a) (ref. 4). Here we identify, using a direct genetic screen, Seladin-1 (also known as Dhcr24) as a key mediator of Ras-induced senescence. Following oncogenic and oxidative stress, Seladin-1 binds p53 amino terminus and displaces E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 from p53, thus resulting in p53 accumulation. Additionally, Seladin-1 associates with Mdm2 independently of p53, potentially affecting other Mdm2 targets. Ablation of Seladin-1 causes the bypass of Ras-induced senescence in rodent and human fibroblasts, and allows Ras to transform these cells. Wild-type Seladin-1, but not mutants that disrupt its association with either p53 or Mdm2, suppresses the transformed phenotype. The same mutants are also inactive in directing p53-dependent oxidative stress response. These results show an unanticipated role for Seladin-1, previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease and cholesterol metabolism, in integrating cellular response to oncogenic and oxidative stress.
Progressive cerebral deposition of the amyloid beta-peptide is an early and invariant feature of Alzheimer's disease. The beta-peptide is released by proteolytic cleavages from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP), a membrane-spanning glycoprotein expressed in most mammalian cells. Normal secretion of beta APP involves a cleavage in the beta-peptide region, releasing the soluble extramembranous portion and retaining a 10K C-terminal fragment in the membrane. Because this secretory pathway precludes beta-amyloid formation, we searched for an alternative proteolytic processing pathway that can generate beta-peptide-bearing fragments from full-length beta APP. Incubation of living human endothelial cells with a beta APP antibody revealed reinternalization of mature beta APP from the cell surface and its targeting to endosomes/lysosomes. After cell-surface biotinylation, full-length biotinylated beta APP was recovered inside the cells. Purification of lysosomes directly demonstrated the presence of mature beta APP and an extensive array of beta-peptide-containing proteolytic products. Our results define a second processing pathway for beta APP and suggest that it may be responsible for generating amyloid-bearing fragments in Alzheimer's disease.
Since the time of Darwin, evolutionary biologists have been fascinated by the spectacular adaptations to insect pollination exhibited by orchids. However, despite being the most diverse plant family on Earth, the Orchidaceae lack a definitive fossil record and thus many aspects of their evolutionary history remain obscure. Here we report an exquisitely preserved orchid pollinarium (of Meliorchis caribea gen. et sp. nov.) attached to the mesoscutellum of an extinct stingless bee, Proplebeia dominicana, recovered from Miocene amber in the Dominican Republic, that is 15-20 million years (Myr) old. This discovery constitutes both the first unambiguous fossil of Orchidaceae and an unprecedented direct fossil observation of a plant-pollinator interaction. By applying cladistic methods to a morphological character matrix, we resolve the phylogenetic position of M. caribea within the extant subtribe Goodyerinae (subfamily Orchidoideae). We use the ages of other fossil monocots and M. caribea to calibrate a molecular phylogenetic tree of the Orchidaceae. Our results indicate that the most recent common ancestor of extant orchids lived in the Late Cretaceous (76-84 Myr ago), and also suggest that the dramatic radiation of orchids began shortly after the mass extinctions at the K/T boundary. These results further support the hypothesis of an ancient origin for Orchidaceae.
The Cambrian appearance of fossils representing diverse phyla has long inspired hypotheses about possible genetic or environmental catalysts of early animal evolution. Only recently, however, have data begun to emerge that can resolve the sequence of genetic and morphological innovations, environmental events, and ecological interactions that collectively shaped Cambrian evolution. Assembly of the modern genetic tool kit for development and the initial divergence of major animal clades occurred during the Proterozoic Eon. Crown group morphologies diversified in the Cambrian through changes in the genetic regulatory networks that organize animal ontogeny. Cambrian radiation may have been triggered by environmental perturbation near the Proterozoic-Cambrian boundary and subsequently amplified by ecological interactions within reorganized ecosystems.
Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen in humans, causing both debilitating mucosal infections and potentially life-threatening systemic infections. Until recently, C. albicans was thought to be strictly asexual, existing only as an obligate diploid. A cryptic mating cycle has since been uncovered in which diploid a and alpha cells undergo efficient cell and nuclear fusion, resulting in tetraploid a/alpha mating products. Whereas mating between a and alpha cells has been established (heterothallism), we report here two pathways for same-sex mating (homothallism) in C. albicans. First, unisexual populations of a cells were found to undergo autocrine pheromone signalling and same-sex mating in the absence of the Bar1 protease. In both C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bar1 is produced by a cells and inactivates mating pheromone alpha, typically secreted by alpha cells. C. albicans Deltabar1 a cells were shown to secrete both a and alpha mating pheromones; alpha-pheromone activated self-mating in these cells in a process dependent on Ste2, the receptor for alpha-pheromone. In addition, pheromone production by alpha cells was found to promote same-sex mating between wild-type a cells. These results establish that homothallic mating can occur in C. albicans, revealing the potential for genetic exchange even within unisexual populations of the organism. Furthermore, Bar1 protease has an unexpected but pivotal role in determining whether sexual reproduction can potentially be homothallic or is exclusively heterothallic. These findings also have implications for the mode of sexual reproduction in related species that propagate unisexually, and indicate a role for specialized sexual cycles in the survival and adaptation of pathogenic fungi.
Recombination is the exchange of information between two homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The rate of recombination per nucleotide, which profoundly affects the evolution of chromosomal segments, is calculated by comparing genetic and physical maps. Human physical maps have been constructed using cytogenetics, overlapping DNA clones and radiation hybrids; but the ultimate and by far the most accurate physical map is the actual nucleotide sequence. The completion of the draft human genomic sequence provides us with the best opportunity yet to compare the genetic and physical maps. Here we describe our estimates of female, male and sex-average recombination rates for about 60% of the genome. Recombination rates varied greatly along each chromosome, from 0 to at least 9 centiMorgans per megabase (cM Mb(-1)). Among several sequence and marker parameters tested, only relative marker position along the metacentric chromosomes in males correlated strongly with recombination rate. We identified several chromosomal regions up to 6 Mb in length with particularly low (deserts) or high (jungles) recombination rates. Linkage disequilibrium was much more common and extended for greater distances in the deserts than in the jungles.
To study the mechanisms underlying the high pathogenicity of Ebola virus, we have established a system that allows the recovery of infectious virus from cloned cDNA and thus permits genetic manipulation. We created a mutant in which the editing site of the gene encoding envelope glycoprotein (GP) was eliminated. This mutant no longer expressed the nonstructural glycoprotein sGP. Synthesis of GP increased, but most of it accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum as immature precursor. The mutant was significantly more cytotoxic than wild-type virus, indicating that cytotoxicity caused by GP is down-regulated by the virus through transcriptional RNA editing and expression of sGP.
Mutational inactivation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility (RB) gene, a recessive cancer gene, has been implicated in the genesis of retinoblastoma and certain other human neoplasms. This gene is now shown to be inactivated in two of nine human breast cancer cell lines examined. The RB gene of one cell line had a homozygous internal duplication of a 5-kilobase region containing exons 5 and 6. The RB messenger RNA transcript was correspondingly lengthened, and its translation was probably terminated prematurely due to a shifted reading frame. The other cell line had a homozygous deletion of the RB gene that removed the entire gene beyond exon 2. The RB gene product, pp110RB, was not detectable in either cell line by immuno-precipitation with specific antibodies. These findings are significant in relation to proposed genetic mechanisms of breast cancer formation.
The DED1 gene, which encodes a putative RNA helicase, has been implicated in nuclear pre-messenger RNA splicing in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is shown here by genetic and biochemical analysis that translation, rather than splicing, is severely impaired in two newly isolated ded1 conditional mutants. Preliminary evidence suggests that the protein Ded1p may be required for the initiation step of translation, as is the distinct DEAD-box protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A). The DED1 gene could be functionally replaced by a mouse homolog, PL10, which suggests that the function of Ded1p in translation is evolutionarily conserved.
Vascular plants have a long-distance transport system consisting of two tissue types with elongated cell files, phloem and xylem. Phloem has two basic cell types, enucleate sieve elements and companion cells. Xylem has various lignified cell types, such as tracheary elements, the differentiation of which involves deposition of elaborate cell wall thickenings and programmed cell death. Until now, little has been known about the genetic control of phloem-xylem patterning. Here we identify the ALTERED PHLOEM DEVELOPMENT (APL) gene, which encodes a MYB coiled-coil-type transcription factor that is required for phloem identity in Arabidopsis. Phloem is established through asymmetric cell divisions and subsequent differentiation. We show that both processes are impaired by a recessive apl mutation. This is associated with the formation of cells that have xylem characteristics in the position of phloem. The APL expression profile is consistent with a key role in phloem development. Ectopic APL expression in the vascular bundle inhibits xylem development. Our studies suggest that APL has a dual role both in promoting phloem differentiation and in repressing xylem differentiation during vascular development.
The genetic control of neuronal differentiation has been studied by examining mutations that affect the development and function of the six touch receptor neurons of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. By screening for touch-insensitive mutants, it has been possible to identify 18 genes (represented by 417 mutations) that are required at various stages in the developmental program for touch cell differentiation. Two of the genes are needed for the generation of precursors in the touch cell lineages; without the precursors, touch cells are not made. A third gene, mec-3, specifies the differentiation of the touch cells, probably by acting as a transcription factor. The remaining 15 genes are likely targets of mec-3 action; mutants defective in these genes have nonfunctioning, yet differentiated, touch cells. Some of these latter genes are needed for the formation of cell-specific components of the touch cells, such as a set of microtubules that are only found in these cells. The study of the touch genes should help us understand how touch cell fate is determined, how microtubule form is specified, and, perhaps, how mechanical stimuli are transduced.
The sequence of the mouse genome is a key informational tool for understanding the contents of the human genome and a key experimental tool for biomedical research. Here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. We also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. We discuss topics including the analysis of the evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identification of intraspecies polymorphism.
Before their recognition by T lymphocytes, protein antigens generally require processing by antigen-presenting cells. In a poorly understood series of events, the protein antigen is internalized, transformed and re-expressed on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell in association with gene products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Small peptides derived from the native protein can be recognized in the absence of antigen processing, suggesting that processing involves proteolytic degradation. These peptides are thought to mimic the naturally produced peptide fragment. We describe here a synthetic peptide antigen of this type which does not require processing but which is nevertheless further processed by splenic antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, this processing event specifically alters the interaction of the peptide with the class II MHC (Ia) molecule, markedly affecting both its potency as an antigen in vitro and its immunogenicity in vivo (IR gene control).
A non-discriminatory base analogue, or universal base, would be an invaluable component of oligonucleotide probes and primers for solving the design problems that arise as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, or when only fragmentary peptide sequence data are available. We have designed an alternative to previous universal nucleoside candidates, a new analogue, 1-(2'-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-3-nitropyrrole (designated M; Fig. 1), which maximizes stacking while minimizing hydrogen-bonding interactions without sterically disrupting a DNA duplex. Oligonucleotides containing M at several sites were used as primers for sequencing and the polymerase chain reaction. The sequencing primer d(5'-CGT AAM CAM AAM ACM AT-3') is as effective as the exact match d(5'-CGT AAT CAG AAA ACA AT-3'). It is also possible to sequence using a primer containing M at several contiguous positions, for example d(5'-CGT AAT MMM MMM MMM AT-3'). Melting curves show that duplexes formed on hybridization of the sequences d(5'-CCT TTT TMT TTT TGG-3') and d(5'-CCA AAA AXA AAA AGG-3'), where X is A, C, G or T, melted at a lower temperature than the corresponding duplexes containing only d(A.T) and d(C.G) base pairs, but showing little variation among different X bases (Tm range 3 degrees C).
Several common genetic variations have been associated with type 2 diabetes, but the exact disease mechanisms are still poorly elucidated. Using congenic strains from the diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rat, we identified a 1.4-megabase genomic locus that was linked to impaired insulin granule docking at the plasma membrane and reduced beta cell exocytosis. In this locus, Adra2a, encoding the alpha2A-adrenergic receptor [alpha(2A)AR], was significantly overexpressed. Alpha(2A)AR mediates adrenergic suppression of insulin secretion. Pharmacological receptor antagonism, silencing of receptor expression, or blockade of downstream effectors rescued insulin secretion in congenic islets. Furthermore, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human ADRA2A gene for which risk allele carriers exhibited overexpression of alpha(2A)AR, reduced insulin secretion, and increased type 2 diabetes risk. Human pancreatic islets from risk allele carriers exhibited reduced granule docking and secreted less insulin in response to glucose; both effects were counteracted by pharmacological alpha(2A)AR antagonists.
Materials in which magnetic and electric order coexist--termed 'multiferroics' or 'magnetoelectrics'--have recently become the focus of much research. In particular, the simultaneous occurrence of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity, combined with an intimate coupling of magnetization and polarization via magnetocapacitive effects, holds promise for new generations of electronic devices. Here we present measurements on a simple cubic spinel compound with unusual, and potentially useful, magnetic and electric properties: it shows ferromagnetic order coexisting with relaxor ferroelectricity (a ferroelectric cluster state with a smeared-out phase transition), both having sizable ordering temperatures and moments. Close to the ferromagnetic ordering temperature, the magnetocapacitive coupling (characterized by a variation of the dielectric constant in an external magnetic field) reaches colossal values, approaching 500 per cent. We attribute the relaxor properties to geometric frustration, which is well known for magnetic moments but here is found to impede long-range order of the structural degrees of freedom that drive the formation of the ferroelectric state.
The ubiquitin-dependent degradation of a test protein beta-galactosidase (beta gal) is preceded by ubiquitination of beta gal. The many (from 1 to more than 20) ubiquitin moieties attached to a molecule of beta gal occur as an ordered chain of branched ubiquitin-ubiquitin conjugates in which the carboxyl-terminal Gly76 of one ubiquitin is jointed to the internal Lys48 of an adjacent ubiquitin. This multiubiquitin chain is linked to one of two specific Lys residues in beta gal. These same Lys residues have been identified by molecular genetic analysis as components of the aminoterminal degradation signal in beta gal. The experiments with ubiquitin mutated at its Lys48 residue indicate that the multiubiquitin chain in a targeted protein is essential for the degradation of the protein.
The ABC excision nuclease of Escherichia coli is an ATP-dependent DNA repair enzyme composed of three protein subunits, UvrA, UvrB and UvrC. The DNA sequences of all three genes have been reported. UvrA, the component that binds directly to the DNA, and UvrB, which attaches itself to the UvrA-DNA complex, both contain consensus sequences though to be diagnostic of ATP-binding sites, although the UvrC sequence does not. We now report that a computer analysis of the UvrA sequence has revealed an unusual series of internal duplications centering around putative metal-binding sites which may be involved in the interaction with DNA. We also find a strong evolutionary relationship to a family of prokaryotic membrane-associated active-transport proteins.
Fishery management plans ignore the potential for evolutionary change in harvestable biomass. We subjected populations of an exploited fish (Menidia menidia) to large, small, or random size-selective harvest of adults over four generations. Harvested biomass evolved rapidly in directions counter to the size-dependent force of fishing mortality. Large-harvested populations initially produced the highest catch but quickly evolved a lower yield than controls. Small-harvested populations did the reverse. These shifts were caused by selection of genotypes with slower or faster rates of growth. Management tools that preserve natural genetic variation are necessary for long-term sustainable yield.
In the field the chirps of neighboring Mecopoda sp. (Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae, and Mecopodinae) males are normally synchronized, but between more distant individuals the chirps are either synchronous or regularly alternating. The phase response to single-stimulus chirps depends on both the phase and the intensity of the stimulus. Iteration of the Poincare map of the phase response predicts a variety of phase-locked synchronization regimes, incuding period-doubling bifurcations, in close agreement with experimental observations. The versatile acoustic behavior of Mecopoda encompasses most of the phenomena found in other synchronizing insects and thus provides a general model of insect synchronization behavior.
The A/J mouse has been used to study the teratogenic affects of phenytoin. The developmental abnormalities produced in offspring of this model are similar to some of the malformations observed in cases of human "fetal hydantoin syndrome." Placing pregnant A/J mice in a hyperoxic chamber after phenytoin injection greatly reduces the incidence of phenytoin-induced cleft lip and palate. These results suggest that phenytoin may affect embryonic development indirectly by altering maternal physiology. This maternally mediated mechanism, and the protection against it afforded by hyperoxia, has general implications for the effects of maternal toxicity on teratogenesis.
Genetic compatibility may drive individual mate choice decisions because of predictable fitness effects associated with breeding with incompatible partners. In Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae), females paired with genetically incompatible males of alternative color morphs overproduce sons, presumably to reduce investment in inviable daughters. We also observed a reduced overall investment in clutch size, egg size, and care to offspring resulting from incompatible matings. Within-female experimental pairings demonstrate that female birds have the ability to adaptively adjust the sex of their eggs and allocate resources on the basis of partner quality. Female Gouldian finches thus make cumulative strategic allocation decisions to minimize the costs of poor-quality pairings when faced with a genetically incompatible partner.
Domestic animals are excellent models for genetic studies of phenotypic evolution. They have evolved genetic adaptations to a new environment, the farm, and have been subjected to strong human-driven selection leading to remarkable phenotypic changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour. Identifying the genetic changes underlying these developments provides new insight into general mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. Here we describe the use of massively parallel sequencing to identify selective sweeps of favourable alleles and candidate mutations that have had a prominent role in the domestication of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and their subsequent specialization into broiler (meat-producing) and layer (egg-producing) chickens. We have generated 44.5-fold coverage of the chicken genome using pools of genomic DNA representing eight different populations of domestic chickens as well as red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), the major wild ancestor. We report more than 7,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, almost 1,300 deletions and a number of putative selective sweeps. One of the most striking selective sweeps found in all domestic chickens occurred at the locus for thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which has a pivotal role in metabolic regulation and photoperiod control of reproduction in vertebrates. Several of the selective sweeps detected in broilers overlapped genes associated with growth, appetite and metabolic regulation. We found little evidence that selection for loss-of-function mutations had a prominent role in chicken domestication, but we detected two deletions in coding sequences that we suggest are functionally important. This study has direct application to animal breeding and enhances the importance of the domestic chicken as a model organism for biomedical research.
RNA interference (RNAi) is the mechanism through which double-stranded RNAs silence cognate genes. In plants, this can occur at both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels; however, in animals, only post-transcriptional RNAi has been reported to date. In both plants and animals, RNAi is characterized by the presence of RNAs of about 22 nucleotides in length that are homologous to the gene that is being suppressed. These 22-nucleotide sequences serve as guide sequences that instruct a multicomponent nuclease, RISC, to destroy specific messenger RNAs. Here we identify an enzyme, Dicer, which can produce putative guide RNAs. Dicer is a member of the RNase III family of nucleases that specifically cleave double-stranded RNAs, and is evolutionarily conserved in worms, flies, plants, fungi and mammals. The enzyme has a distinctive structure, which includes a helicase domain and dual RNase III motifs. Dicer also contains a region of homology to the RDE1/QDE2/ARGONAUTE family that has been genetically linked to RNAi.
Pycnogonids (sea spiders) are marine arthropods numbering some 1,160 extant species. They are globally distributed in depths of up to 6,000 metres, and locally abundant; however, their typically delicate form and non-biomineralized cuticle has resulted in an extremely sparse fossil record that is not accepted universally. There are two opposing views of their phylogenetic position: either within Chelicerata as sister group to the euchelicerates, or as a sister taxon to all other euarthropods. The Silurian Herefordshire Konservat-Lagerstatte in England (approximately 425 million years (Myr) bp) yields exceptionally preserved three-dimensional fossils that provide unrivalled insights into the palaeobiology of a variety of invertebrates. The fossils are preserved as calcitic void in-fills in carbonate concretions within a volcaniclastic horizon, and are reconstructed digitally. Here we describe a new pycnogonid from this deposit, which is the oldest adult sea spider by approximately 35 Myr and the most completely known fossil species. The large chelate first appendage is consistent with a chelicerate affinity for the pycnogonids. Cladistic analyses place the new species near the base of the pycnogonid crown group, implying that the latter had arisen by the Silurian period.
Melanocytes are phenotypically prominent but histologically inconspicuous skin cells. They are responsible for the pigmentation of skin and hair, and thereby contribute to the appearance of skin and provide protection from damage by ultraviolet radiation. Pigmentation mutants in various species are highly informative about basic genetic and developmental pathways, and provide important clues to the processes of photoprotection, cancer predisposition and even human evolution. Skin is the most common site of cancer in humans. Continued understanding of melanocyte contributions to skin biology will hopefully provide new opportunities for the prevention and treatment of skin diseases.
Modern pinnipeds (seals, sea lions and the walrus) are semi-aquatic, generally marine carnivores the limbs of which have been modified into flippers. Recent phylogenetic studies using morphological and molecular evidence support pinniped monophyly, and suggest a sister relationship with ursoids (for example bears) or musteloids (the clade that includes skunks, badgers, weasels and otters). Although the position of pinnipeds within modern carnivores appears moderately well resolved, fossil evidence of the morphological steps leading from a terrestrial ancestor to the modern marine forms has been weak or contentious. The earliest well-represented fossil pinniped is Enaliarctos, a marine form with flippers, which had appeared on the northwestern shores of North America by the early Miocene epoch. Here we report the discovery of a nearly complete skeleton of a new semi-aquatic carnivore from an early Miocene lake deposit in Nunavut, Canada, that represents a morphological link in early pinniped evolution. The new taxon retains a long tail and the proportions of its fore- and hindlimbs are more similar to those of modern terrestrial carnivores than to modern pinnipeds. Morphological traits indicative of semi-aquatic adaptation include a forelimb with a prominent deltopectoral ridge on the humerus, a posterodorsally expanded scapula, a pelvis with relatively short ilium, a shortened femur and flattened phalanges, suggestive of webbing. The new fossil shows evidence of pinniped affinities and similarities to the early Oligocene Amphicticeps from Asia and the late Oligocene and Miocene Potamotherium from Europe. The discovery suggests that the evolution of pinnipeds included a freshwater transitional phase, and may support the hypothesis that the Arctic was an early centre of pinniped evolution.
Human cytomegalovirus infects vascular tissues and has been associated with atherogenesis and coronary restenosis. Although established laboratory strains of human cytomegalovirus have lost the ability to grow on vascular endothelial cells, laboratory strains of murine cytomegalovirus retain this ability. With the use of a forward-genetic procedure involving random transposon mutagenesis and rapid phenotypic screening, we identified a murine cytomegalovirus gene governing endothelial cell tropism. This gene, M45, shares sequence homology to ribonucleotide reductase genes. Endothelial cells infected with M45-mutant viruses rapidly undergo apoptosis, suggesting that a viral strategy to evade destruction by cellular apoptosis is indispensable for viral growth in endothelial cells.
The innate immune system recognizes nucleic acids during infection and tissue damage. Whereas viral RNA is detected by endosomal toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8) and cytoplasmic RIG-I and MDA5, endosomal TLR9 and cytoplasmic DAI bind DNA, resulting in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and interferon regulatory factor transcription factors. However, viruses also trigger pro-inflammatory responses, which remain poorly defined. Here we show that internalized adenoviral DNA induces maturation of pro-interleukin-1beta in macrophages, which is dependent on NALP3 and ASC, components of the innate cytosolic molecular complex termed the inflammasome. Correspondingly, NALP3- and ASC-deficient mice display reduced innate inflammatory responses to adenovirus particles. Inflammasome activation also occurs as a result of transfected cytosolic bacterial, viral and mammalian (host) DNA, but in this case sensing is dependent on ASC but not NALP3. The DNA-sensing pro-inflammatory pathway functions independently of TLRs and interferon regulatory factors. Thus, in addition to viral and bacterial components or danger signals in general, inflammasomes sense potentially dangerous cytoplasmic DNA, strengthening their central role in innate immunity.
Mossel and Vigoda (Reports, 30 September 2005, p. 2207) show that nearest neighbor interchange transitions, commonly used in phylogenetic Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, perform poorly on mixtures of dissimilar trees. However, the conditions leading to their results are artificial. Standard MCMC convergence diagnostics would detect the problem in real data, and correction of the model misspecification would solve it.
Hypertension is a common multifactorial vascular disorder of largely unknown cause. Recognition that hypertension is in part genetically determined has motivated studies to identify mutations that confer susceptibility. Thus far, mutations in at least 10 genes have been shown to alter blood pressure; most of these are rare mutations imparting large quantitative effects that either raise or lower blood pressure. These mutations alter blood pressure through a common pathway, changing salt and water reabsorption in the kidney. These findings demonstrate the utility of molecular genetic approaches to the understanding of blood pressure variation and may provide insight into the physiologic mechanisms underlying common forms of hypertension.
Ruffles are specialized plasma membrane ultrastructures of mammalian cells though to be integral to growth, development and locomotion. Induced by growth factors, mitogens or oncogene expression, ruffles are sites of filamentous actin rearrangement and are temporally associated with enhanced pinocytosis. But the function of ruffles, their mechanism of induction and their role in pinocytosis are not understood. We have observed formation of structures resembling ruffles associated with the site of entry of invasive Salmonella typhimurium. Here we report that ruffles elicited by invasive Salmonella directly mediate internalization of non-invasive bacteria in a macropinocytotic fashion, a phenomenon we term 'passive entry'. Furthermore, ruffles induced in the absence of Salmonella also facilitate passive entry. We present evidence that ruffles, common to many signalling events, comprise the macropinocytotic machinery mediating pinocytosis and are subverted by Salmonella so as to enter mammalian cells.
Protoplasts of sexually incompatible species have been fused and in some combinations have given rise to somatic hybrid plants. Partial elimination of parental chromosomes from either species is common in such hybrids, but total chromosome loss has generally occurred only with phylogenetically unrelated pairings. Genetic function of one parent may be retained despite a complete loss of its chromosomes, suggesting that genetic introgression is possible in the absence of complete donor chromosomes. A model interspecific combination for such studies is the potato-tomato somatic hybrid for which numerous phenotypes and karyotypes are encountered at the outset, with a broader range observed in the second somatic generation.
At least four probable components of potassium channels are encoded at the Drosophila Shaker locus, by a family of alternatively spliced transcripts. Alternative splicing may provide one mechanism of generating the remarkable diversity of potassium channels.
Functional and structural brain imaging has identified neural and neurotransmitter systems involved in schizophrenia and their link to cognitive and behavioural disturbances such as psychosis. Mapping such abnormalities in patients, however, cannot fully capture the strong neurodevelopmental component of schizophrenia that pre-dates manifest illness. A recent strategy to address this issue has been to focus on mechanisms of disease risk. Imaging genetics techniques have made it possible to define neural systems that mediate heritable risk linked to candidate and genome-wide-supported common variants, and mechanisms for environmental risk and gene-environment interactions are emerging. Characterizing the neural risk architecture of schizophrenia provides a translational research strategy for future treatments.
Retinoblastoma (RB) is a malignant tumor of developing retina that arises when abnormalities resulting in loss of function affect both alleles of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus (RB1) on chromosome 13q. The majority of RB tumors do not show gross alterations in a 4.7-kb fragment (4.7R), which is a candidate RB1 gene. To search for more subtle mutations, the ribonuclease protection method was used to analyze 4.7R messenger RNA from RB tumors. Five of 11 RB tumors, which exhibit normal 4.7R DNA and normal-sized RNA transcripts, showed abnormal ribonuclease cleavage patterns. Three of the five mutations affected the same region of the messenger RNA, consistent with an effect on splicing involving an as yet unidentified 5' exon. The high frequency of mutations in 4.7R supports the identification of 4.7R as the RB1 gene. However, the unusual nature of some of the abnormalities of 4.7 R alleles indicates that the accepted sequence of genetic events involved in the genesis of RB may require reevaluation.
In allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT), donor lymphocytes play a central therapeutic role in both graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) and immune reconstitution. However, their use is limited by the risk of severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Eight patients who relapsed or developed Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoma after T cell-depleted BMT were then treated with donor lymphocytes transduced with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) suicide gene. The transduced lymphocytes survived for up to 12 months, resulting in antitumor activity in five patients. Three patients developed GvHD, which could be effectively controlled by ganciclovir-induced elimination of the transduced cells. These data show that genetic manipulation of donor lymphocytes may increase the efficacy and safety of allo-BMT and expand its application to a larger number of patients.
The hydrolysis of ATP by a group of RNA-dependent ATPases (DEAD/H proteins) is required for spliceosome assembly, but not for the subsequent transesterification reactions. Little is known about the function of these ATPases in relation to the RNA conformational changes that occur in formation of active structures, in which U2/U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) interactions are essential for splicing to take place. Using a synthetic lethal genetic screen, we have isolated four yeast splicing factors involved in U2/U6 snRNA interactions (D.X. et al., manuscript in preparation). The RNA-dependent ATPase activity associated with one such factor, the Slt22 protein, is stimulated preferentially by annealed U2/U6 snRNAs. Both mutant slt22-1 and U2 snRNA cause a reduction in stimulation. The slt22-1 mutation blocks splicing at or before the first step, resulting in the accumulation of an unusual complex which lacks U5 snRNA. Our results indicate that the U2/U6 snRNA interactions facilitated by Slt22 are also involved in the interaction of U5 snRNA with the spliceosome.
There are 481 segments longer than 200 base pairs (bp) that are absolutely conserved (100% identity with no insertions or deletions) between orthologous regions of the human, rat, and mouse genomes. Nearly all of these segments are also conserved in the chicken and dog genomes, with an average of 95 and 99% identity, respectively. Many are also significantly conserved in fish. These ultraconserved elements of the human genome are most often located either overlapping exons in genes involved in RNA processing or in introns or nearby genes involved in the regulation of transcription and development. Along with more than 5000 sequences of over 100 bp that are absolutely conserved among the three sequenced mammals, these represent a class of genetic elements whose functions and evolutionary origins are yet to be determined, but which are more highly conserved between these species than are proteins and appear to be essential for the ontogeny of mammals and other vertebrates.
Bacteria in the genus Rhizobium normally fix nitrogen only when they interact with leguminous plants to produce on the roots a highly differentiated structure, the nodule, within which the bacteria differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. By contrast, the enteric bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae reduces nitrogen in a free-living state in conditions of low oxygen tension and deficiency of fixed nitrogen. In K. pneumoniae, the overall circuitry by which nitrogen-fixation (nif) genes are regulated has been elucidated. In response to ammonia starvation, the product of the glnG gene activates transcription of the nifLA operon; this activation is dependent on the product of glnF (ref. 4). The nifA gene product is in turn required for transcription of all the other nif genes, including the nifHDK operon which codes for the subunits of nitrogenase. In contrast, very little is known about the sequence of events involved in the regulated change in rhizobial nif gene expression associated with bacteroid differentiation. In the work described here, we identify the K. pneumoniae and Rhizobium meliloti nifHDK promoters by mapping the in vivo start points of transcription. By defining and comparing the DNA sequences of these two promoters, we find that they share an unexpected degree of homology. Further, by constructing fusions of each of the two promoters to the lacZ gene from Escherichia coli, we show that both promoters are activated by the product of the K. pneumoniae nifA gene.
the crystal packing of the B-DNA dodecamer d(ACCG-GCGCCACA).d(TGTGGCGCCGGT) is characterized by the reciprocal fit of double helices with specific base-backbone interactions in the major groove. Cooling the crystals below -10 degrees C stabilizes a new conformational state with a long-range sequence-dependent one-step shift in the major-groove base pairing. The tilt of the bases leads to the disruption of the Watson-Crick pairing in the major groove and to the formation of interactions with the 5' neighbour of their complement. This alteration propagates along the helical axis over more than half a turn. As a result, the molecular structure is normal when seen from the minor groove side and mismatched in the major groove. Comparison with a parent isomorphous dodecamer structure corresponding to the codon 10-13 of the c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene show that this new structural feature is sequence dependent and clearly favoured by (CA)n tracts. As(CA)n tracts of DNA are involved both in recombination and in transcription, this new recognition pattern should be considered in the analysis of the various processes involving the reading of the genetic information.
The common cuckoo Cuculus canorus is divided into host-specific races (gentes). Females of each race lay a distinctive egg type that tends to match the host's eggs, for instance, brown and spotted for meadow pipit hosts or plain blue for redstart hosts. The puzzle is how these gentes remain distinct. Here, we provide genetic evidence that gentes are restricted to female lineages, with cross mating by males maintaining the common cuckoo genetically as one species. We show that there is differentiation between gentes in maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, but not in microsatellite loci of nuclear DNA. This supports recent behavioural evidence that female, but not male, common cuckoos specialize on a particular host, and is consistent with the possibility that genes affecting cuckoo egg type are located on the female-specific W sex chromosome. Our results also support the ideas that common cuckoos often switched hosts during evolution, and that some gentes may have multiple, independent origins, due to colonization by separate ancestral lineages.
The phenomenon of homologous recombination, which allows specific gene conversion and gene insertion, can be a powerful system for the study of eukaryotic cell biology. Data are presented demonstrating that integration of a transfected plasmid by homologous recombination occurs in the motile eukaryotic cell Dictyostelium discoideum. A plasmid carrying a G418 resistance gene and the amino terminal half of the myosin heavy chain gene was used to transfect Dictyostelium. A large fraction of the resultant G418-resistant cells had the plasmid integrated into the single genomic copy of the heavy chain gene. These cells, which fail to express the native myosin but express the myosin fragment, are defective in cytokinesis and become large and multinucleate. In spite of the absence of native myosin, these cells, termed hmm cells, exhibit many forms of cell movement, including membrane ruffling, phagocytosis, and chemotaxis. The hmm cells can aggregate but are blocked at a later stage in the Dictyostelium developmental cycle. The hmm cells revert to the wild-type phenotype. Reversion of the hmm phenotype is due to excision and loss of the transforming plasmid. The revertant cells express native myosin, are G418 sensitive, and have a normal developmental cycle. These results constitute genetic proof that the intact myosin molecule is required for cytokinesis and not for karyokinesis.
Spiders produce a variety of silks that range from Lycra-like elastic fibers to Kevlar-like superfibers. A gene family from the spider Araneus diadematus was found to encode silk-forming proteins (fibroins) with different proportions of amorphous glycine-rich domains and crystal domains built from poly(alanine) and poly(glycine-alanine) repeat motifs. Spiders produce silks of different composition by gland-specific expression of this gene family, which allows for a range of mechanical properties according to the crystal-forming potential of the constituent fibroins. These principles of fiber property control may be important in the development of genetically engineered structural proteins.
X chromosome inactivation is the silencing mechanism eutherian mammals use to equalize the expression of X-linked genes between males and females early in embryonic development. In the mouse, genetic control of inactivation requires elements within the X inactivation center (Xic) on the X chromosome that influence the choice of which X chromosome is to be inactivated in individual cells. It has long been posited that unidentified autosomal factors are essential to the process. We have used chemical mutagenesis in the mouse to identify specific factors involved in X inactivation and report two genetically distinct autosomal mutations with dominant effects on X chromosome choice early in embryogenesis.
All homeotherms use thermogenesis to maintain their core body temperature, ensuring that cellular functions and physiological processes can continue in cold environments. In the prevailing model of thermogenesis, when the hypothalamus senses cold temperatures it triggers sympathetic discharge, resulting in the release of noradrenaline in brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue. Acting via the b(3)-adrenergic receptors, noradrenaline induces lipolysis in white adipocytes, whereas it stimulates the expression of thermogenic genes, such as PPAR-g coactivator 1a (Ppargc1a), uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (Acsl1), in brown adipocytes. However, the precise nature of all the cell types involved in this efferent loop is not well established. Here we report in mice an unexpected requirement for the interleukin-4 (IL-4)-stimulated program of alternative macrophage activation in adaptive thermogenesis. Exposure to cold temperature rapidly promoted alternative activation of adipose tissue macrophages, which secrete catecholamines to induce thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue and lipolysis in white adipose tissue. Absence of alternatively activated macrophages impaired metabolic adaptations to cold, whereas administration of IL-4 increased thermogenic gene expression, fatty acid mobilization and energy expenditure, all in a macrophage-dependent manner. Thus, we have discovered a role for alternatively activated macrophages in the orchestration of an important mammalian stress response, the response to cold.
About 30% of human tumours contain a mutation in one of the three ras genes leading to the production of p21ras oncoproteins that are thought to make a major contribution to the transformed phenotype of the tumour. The biochemical mode of action of the ras proteins is unknown but as they bind GTP and GDP and have an intrinsic GTPase activity, they may function like regulatory G proteins and control cell proliferation by regulating signal transduction pathways at the plasma membrane. It is assumed that an external signal is detected by a membrane molecule (or detector) that stimulates the conversion of p21.GDP to p21.GTP which then interacts with a target molecule (or effector) to generate an internal signal. Recently a cytoplasmic protein, GAP, has been identified that interacts with the ras proteins, dramatically increasing the GTPase activity of normal p21 but not of the oncoproteins. We report here that GAP appears to interact with p21ras at a site previously identified as the 'effector' site, strongly implicating GAP as the biological target for regulation by p21.
The adult Drosophila midgut contains multipotent intestinal stem cells (ISCs) scattered along its basement membrane that have been shown by lineage analysis to generate both enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells. ISCs containing high levels of cytoplasmic Delta-rich vesicles activate the canonical Notch pathway and down-regulate Delta within their daughters, a process that programs these daughters to become enterocytes. ISCs that express little vesiculate Delta, or are genetically impaired in Notch signaling, specify their daughters to become enteroendocrine cells. Thus, ISCs control daughter cell fate by modulating Notch signaling over time. Our studies suggest that ISCs actively coordinate cell production with local tissue requirements by this mechanism.
Deposition of the amyloid-beta peptide is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. A high-throughput functional genomics screen identified G protein-coupled receptor 3 (GPR3), a constitutively active orphan G protein-coupled receptor, as a modulator of amyloid-beta production. Overexpression of GPR3 stimulated amyloid-beta production, whereas genetic ablation of GPR3 prevented accumulation of the amyloid-beta peptide in vitro and in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. GPR3 expression led to increased formation and cell-surface localization of the mature gamma-secretase complex in the absence of an effect on Notch processing. GPR3 is highly expressed in areas of the normal human brain implicated in Alzheimer's disease and is elevated in the sporadic Alzheimer's disease brain. Thus, GPR3 represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
The transition from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic, approximately 40,000-35,000 radiocarbon years ago, marks a turning point in the history of human evolution in Europe. Many changes in the archaeological and fossil record at this time have been associated with the appearance of anatomically modern humans. Before this transition, the Neanderthals roamed the continent, but their remains have not been found in the northernmost part of Eurasia. It is generally believed that this vast region was not colonized by humans until the final stage of the last Ice Age some 13,000-14,000 years ago. Here we report the discovery of traces of human occupation nearly 40,000 years old at Mamontovaya Kurya, a Palaeolithic site situated in the European part of the Russian Arctic. At this site we have uncovered stone artefacts, animal bones and a mammoth tusk with human-made marks from strata covered by thick Quaternary deposits. This is the oldest documented evidence for human presence at this high latitude; it implies that either the Neanderthals expanded much further north than previously thought or that modern humans were present in the Arctic only a few thousand years after their first appearance in Europe.
Mice systematically bred for randomization of their genotype show large individual differences when performing a two-way avoidance task (shuttle-box learning). Their behavioral scores correlate strongly (r = -0.80, P less than .01) with the number of mossy fibers synapsing on basal dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, poor avoiders having relatively more such terminals. This confirms previous findings showing that rat and mouse strains known for genetically dependent poor avoidance learning have extended intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber projections.
A survey of electrophoretic variation in 20 enzymes from 109 clones of escherichia coli from natural populations yielded an estimate of mean genetic diversity approximately twice that reported in an earlier study and four to five times larger than estimates fro most eukaryotic species. Despite this extensive variability, the number of distinctive genotypes apparently is rather limited. Identical clones were obtained from unassociated hosts, and a clone that is electrophoretically indistinguishable from the laboratory strain Escherichia coli K-12 was isolated from a human infant. The results suggest that rates of genetic recombination in natural populations of Escherichia coli are low. These findings have implications for our understanding of the genetic structure of Escherichia coli populations and the factors determining the amount of neutral gene variability in this bacterial species.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease whose onset is believed to be triggered by unknown environmental factors acting on a predisposing genetic background. Islet-infiltrating T (IIT) cells from two IDDM patients, who had died at the onset of the disease from brain swelling as a complication of ketoacidosis, were analysed. The results provided evidence for the involvement of a pancreatic islet cell membrane-bound superantigen as a diabetes aetiopathogenetic factor. There was a selective expansion of a T-cell receptor (TCR) variable segment of the beta-chain (V beta 7) in these IIT cells in association with unselected V alpha-chain segments; extensive junctional diversity of the TCR V beta 7 chains; and evidence of positive selection, after exposure to diabetic islet cell membrane preparations, of V beta 7+ T-cell clones among peripheral blood lymphocytes from non-diabetic individuals.
During human development there is a switch from fetal to adult haemoglobin formation, reflecting the differential expression of fetal (G gamma and A gamma) and adult (beta and delta) globin genes. Mutations that inhibit this switch produce variants of the syndrome of hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin (HPFH). Adult heterozygotes for these mutants produce 15-30% fetal haemoglobin (HbF) in their red cells. The general assumption is that the mutations result in a permanent switching on of gamma-globin genes. Here, however, we show that fetal globin expression can be turned off in cultures of HPFH cells by an uncharacterized factor in fetal sheep serum. This is the first demonstration that mutations affecting the developmental expression of globin genes can be modulated by exogenous factors. The findings raise the possibility that the phenotype of HPFH is not simply the direct result of mutations in or around globin genes but the consequence of the mutations on the interaction of globin genes with trans-acting regulatory factors.
The TE1 family of transposable elements (TEs) of Drosophila consists of unusually large transposons, cytologically visible in larval polytene chromosomes as one or more bands. They are composite elements, as their termini consist of foldback (FB) sequences which are themselves transposable. The location of FB elements at the termini of transposable elements suggests that these sequences have a direct role in the genetic instability of TEs. To investigate the structural and phenotypic consequence of TE excision, we have cloned genomic DNA required for the expression of the no-ocelli (noc) gene of Drosophila; this gene has been mutated by the insertion of TE146, a member of the TE1 family carrying six polytene chromosome bands including functional copies of the white (w+) and roughest (rst+) genes. As reported here, our experiments indicate that the spontaneous excision of TE146, which results in the loss of the w+ and rst+ markers, can occur either as a single-step event or following a partial internal deletion. In either case, the end product is an imprecise excision in which a residual portion of the element, varying in size from 3 to 10 kilobases (kb), is left at the insertion site. These residual sequences share homology with the FB family. Furthermore, despite their imprecise nature, all these spontaneous excisions restore a wild-type noc+ phenotype.
The genetic mechanisms regulating tetrapod limb development are well characterized, but how they were assembled during evolution and their function in basal vertebrates is poorly understood. Initial studies report that chondrichthyans, the most primitive extant vertebrates with paired appendages, differ from ray-finned fish and tetrapods in having Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-independent patterning of the appendage skeleton. Here we demonstrate that chondrichthyans share patterns of appendage Shh expression, Shh appendage-specific regulatory DNA, and Shh function with ray-finned fish and tetrapods. These studies demonstrate that some aspects of Shh function are deeply conserved in vertebrate phylogeny, but also highlight how the evolution of Shh regulation may underlie major morphological changes during appendage evolution.
Cytogenetic analysis has identified chromosome 11p13 as the smallest overlap region for deletions found in individuals with WAGR syndrome, which includes Wilms tumour (a recessive childhood nephroblastoma), aniridia, genito-urinary abnormalities and mental retardation. The underlying loci have since been resolved into an aniridia (AN2) locus at a telomeric position, and a locus of closely spaced genes or a single pleiotropic gene involved in genito-urinary tract abnormalities and Wilms tumour at a more centromeric position. Pulsed-field gel analysis of the 11p13 region has revealed the presence of several putative CpG islands, structures which are frequently associated with the 5' ends of expressed sequences, mainly housekeeping genes and some tissue-specific genes. Starting from a CpG island, we have now isolated four neighbouring CpG islands, all within 650 kilobases (kb), by means of two consecutive bidirectional jumps in rare-cutting restriction-enzyme jumping libraries. In two instances, flanking sequences were conserved in other species and RNA transcripts were identified. A complementary DNA clone isolated for one of them derives from an RNA highly expressed in fetal kidney, and is predicted to encode a Kruppel-like zinc-finger protein that is probably a transcription factor. The entire cDNA region is included in two partially overlapping homozygous deletions found in Wilms tumour DNA samples. Cloning of the breakpoints in one tumour revealed a deletion size of 170 kb, one-third of which is covered by the cDNA. The expression pattern and sequence of this cDNA could point to an important role for its corresponding gene in the normal development of the renal system as well as in Wilms tumour.
A chimeric oligonucleotide composed of DNA and modified RNA residues was used to direct correction of the mutation in the hemoglobin betaS allele. After introduction of the chimeric molecule into lymphoblastoid cells homozygous for the betaS mutation, there was a detectable level of gene conversion of the mutant allele to the normal sequence. The efficient and specific conversion directed by chimeric molecules may hold promise as a therapeutic method for the treatment of genetic diseases.
Forest trees display a perennial growth behavior characterized by a multiple-year delay in flowering and, in temperate regions, an annual cycling between growth and dormancy. We show here that the CO/FT regulatory module, which controls flowering time in response to variations in daylength in annual plants, controls flowering in aspen trees. Unexpectedly, however, it also controls the short-day-induced growth cessation and bud set occurring in the fall. This regulatory mechanism can explain the ecogenetic variation in a highly adaptive trait: the critical daylength for growth cessation displayed by aspen trees sampled across a latitudinal gradient spanning northern Europe.
Bacillus cereus is an opportunistic pathogen causing food poisoning manifested by diarrhoeal or emetic syndromes. It is closely related to the animal and human pathogen Bacillus anthracis and the insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis, the former being used as a biological weapon and the latter as a pesticide. B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis are readily distinguished from B. cereus by the presence of plasmid-borne specific toxins (B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis) and capsule (B. anthracis). But phylogenetic studies based on the analysis of chromosomal genes bring controversial results, and it is unclear whether B. cereus, B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis are varieties of the same species or different species. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the type strain B. cereus ATCC 14579. The complete genome sequence of B. cereus ATCC 14579 together with the gapped genome of B. anthracis A2012 enables us to perform comparative analysis, and hence to identify the genes that are conserved between B. cereus and B. anthracis, and the genes that are unique for each species. We use the former to clarify the phylogeny of the cereus group, and the latter to determine plasmid-independent species-specific markers.
Anterior-to-posterior patterning, the process whereby our digits are differently shaped, is a key aspect of limb development. It depends on the localized expression in posterior limb bud of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and the morphogenetic potential of its diffusing product. By using an inversion of and a large deficiency in the mouse HoxD cluster, we found that a perturbation in the early collinear expression of Hoxd11, Hoxd12, and Hoxd13 in limb buds led to a loss of asymmetry. Ectopic Hox gene expression triggered abnormal Shh transcription, which in turn induced symmetrical expression of Hox genes in digits, thereby generating double posterior limbs. We conclude that early posterior restriction of Hox gene products sets up an anterior-posterior prepattern, which determines the localized activation of Shh. This signal is subsequently translated into digit morphological asymmetry by promoting the late expression of Hoxd genes, two collinear processes relying on opposite genomic topographies, upstream and downstream Shh signaling.
The E2F family is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, with some family members having transcription activation functions and others having repressor functions. Whereas C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have a single E2F activator protein and repressor protein, mammals have at least three activator and five repressor proteins. Why such genetic complexity evolved in mammals is not known. To begin to evaluate this genetic complexity, we targeted the inactivation of the entire subset of activators, E2f1, E2f2, E2f3a and E2f3b, singly or in combination in mice. We demonstrate that E2f3a is sufficient to support mouse embryonic and postnatal development. Remarkably, expression of E2f3b or E2f1 from the E2f3a locus (E2f3a(3bki) or E2f3a(1ki), respectively) suppressed all the postnatal phenotypes associated with the inactivation of E2f3a. We conclude that there is significant functional redundancy among activators and that the specific requirement for E2f3a during postnatal development is dictated by regulatory sequences governing its selective spatiotemporal expression and not by its intrinsic protein functions. These findings provide a molecular basis for the observed specificity among E2F activators during development.
Analysis of differences between siblings (sib pair analysis) is a standard method of genetic linkage analysis for mapping quantitative trait loci, such as those contributing to hypertension and obesity, in humans. In traditional designs, pairs are selected at random or with one sib having an extreme trait value. The majority of such pairs provide little power to detect linkage; only pairs that are concordant for high values, low values, or extremely discordant pairs (for example, one in the top 10 percent and the other in the bottom 10 percent of the distribution) provide substantial power. Focus on discordant pairs can reduce the amount of genotyping necessary over conventional designs by 10- to 40-fold.
Ongoing debate about proper interpretation of DNA sequence polymorphisms and their ability to reconstruct human population history illustrates a important change in perspective that we have achieved in the past 20 years of population genetics. To what extent does the history of a locus represent the history of a population? Tools originally developed for molecular systematics, where genetic lineages have been separated by speciation events, are routinely applied to the analysis of variation within our species, with conflicting results. Because of automated technologies and linkage analysis, we are poised to harvest a wealth of information about our past, if we are successful in moving beyond a current polarization regarding models of human evolution. Rather than just suggesting that true resolution will only come by considering fossil or archaeological evidence, the realistic and appropriate application of genetic models for analysis of population structure is also necessary. Three examples from different dispersal events are highlighted here.
On 19 December 1996 as Galileo passed close to Jupiter's moon, Europa, the magnetometer measured substantial departures from the slowly varying background field of Jupiter's magnetosphere. Currents coupling Europa to Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma could produce perturbations of the observed size. However, the trend of the field perturbations is here modeled as the signature of a Europa-centered dipole moment whose maximum surface magnitude is approximately 240 nanotesla, giving a rough upper limit to the internal field. The dipole orientation is oblique to Europa's spin axis. This orientation may not be probable for a field generated by a core dynamo, but higher order multipoles may be important as they are at Uranus and Neptune. Although the data can be modeled as contributions of an internal field of Europa, they do not confirm its existence. The dipole orientation is also oblique to the imposed field of Jupiter and thus not directly produced as a response to that field. Close to Europa, plasma currents appear to produce perturbations with scale sizes that are small compared with a Europa radius.
Ueno et al. contend that methane found in fluid inclusions within hydrothermally precipitated quartz in the Dresser Formation of western Australia (which is roughly 3.5 Gyr old) provides evidence for microbial methanogenesis in the early Archaean era. The authors discount alternative origins for this methane, suggesting that the range of delta(13)C(CH(4)) values that they record (-56 to -36 per thousand) is attributable to mixing between a primary microbial end-member with a delta(13)C(CH(4)) value of less than -56 per thousand and a mature thermogenic gas enriched in (13)C (about -36 per thousand). However, abiotic methane produced experimentally and in other Precambrian greenstone settings has (13)C-depleted delta(13)C(CH(4)) values, as well as Delta(13)C(CO(2)-CH(4)) relationships that encompass the range measured for the inclusions by Ueno et al. - which suggests that an alternative, abiotic origin for the methane is equally plausible. The conclusions of Ueno et al. about the timing of the onset of microbial methanogenesis might not therefore be justified.
The coordinated regulation of gene expression is required for homeostasis, growth and development in all organisms. Such coordination may be partly achieved at the level of messenger RNA stability, in which the targeted destruction of subsets of transcripts generates the potential for cross-regulating metabolic pathways. In Escherichia coli, the balance and composition of the transcript population is affected by RNase E, an essential endoribonuclease that not only turns over RNA but also processes certain key RNA precursors. RNase E cleaves RNA internally, but its catalytic power is determined by the 5' terminus of the substrate, even if this lies at a distance from the cutting site. Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic domain of RNase E as trapped allosteric intermediates with RNA substrates. Four subunits of RNase E catalytic domain associate into an interwoven quaternary structure, explaining why the subunit organization is required for catalytic activity. The subdomain encompassing the active site is structurally congruent to a deoxyribonuclease, making an unexpected link in the evolutionary history of RNA and DNA nucleases. The structure explains how the recognition of the 5' terminus of the substrate may trigger catalysis and also sheds light on the question of how RNase E might selectively process, rather than destroy, specific RNA precursors.
The lambda immunoglobulin light chain (Ig lambda) locus of BALB/c inbred mice consists of two variable region gene segments (V lambda)1-3, and four constant region gene segments (C lambda)1,2,4,5. Each C lambda gene segment is associated with a unique joining segment (J lambda)2,4-7, and they are organized in two paired units, J3C3-J1C1 and J2C2-J4C4 (refs 4, 8). Using cDNA probes specific for C lambda 1 and C lambda 2 (ref. 9) we have analysed the genomic organization of the C lambda gene segments in wild-derived and inbred strains of mice. Although Southern blots of the genomic DNA of inbred mice show a constant pattern of hybridization, wild-derived mice show a high degree of variation in the number, size and intensity of hybridizing fragments. We have now found that, per haploid genome, mice of a Mus musculus musculus stock isolated from Sladeckovce, Czechoslovakia (CzII) have at least 12 C lambda segments, and mice of a Mus musculus domesticus stock 'Centreville Lights' from Centreville, Maryland (CL) have at least 8 C lambda segments. There appears to have been relatively recent amplifications of the C lambda gene segments in wild mice.
Imprinted genes display parent-of-origin-dependent monoallelic expression that apparently regulates complex mammalian traits, including growth and behavior. The Peg3 gene is expressed in embryos and the adult brain from the paternal allele only. A mutation in the Peg3 gene resulted in growth retardation, as well as a striking impairment of maternal behavior that frequently resulted in death of the offspring. This result may be partly due to defective neuronal connectivity, as well as reduced oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus, because mutant mothers were deficient in milk ejection. This study provides further insights on the evolution of epigenetic regulation of imprinted gene dosage in modulating mammalian growth and behavior.
The stability of the Wnt pathway transcription factor beta-catenin is tightly regulated by the multi-subunit destruction complex. Deregulated Wnt pathway activity has been implicated in many cancers, making this pathway an attractive target for anticancer therapies. However, the development of targeted Wnt pathway inhibitors has been hampered by the limited number of pathway components that are amenable to small molecule inhibition. Here, we used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits beta-catenin-mediated transcription. XAV939 stimulates beta-catenin degradation by stabilizing axin, the concentration-limiting component of the destruction complex. Using a quantitative chemical proteomic approach, we discovered that XAV939 stabilizes axin by inhibiting the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2. Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly conserved domain of axin and stimulate its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus, our study provides new mechanistic insights into the regulation of axin protein homeostasis and presents new avenues for targeted Wnt pathway therapies.
In many organisms, introducing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) causes the degradation of messenger RNA that is homologous to the trigger dsRNA--a process known as RNA interference. The dsRNA is cleaved into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which hybridize to homologous mRNAs and induce their degradation. dsRNAs vary in their ability to trigger RNA interference: many mRNA-targeting dsRNAs show weak phenotypes, and nearly all mRNAs of the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system are refractory to RNA interference. C. elegans eri-1 was identified in a genetic screen for mutants with enhanced sensitivity to dsRNAs. Here we show that eri-1 encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein with domains homologous to nucleic-acid-binding and exonuclease proteins. After exposure to dsRNA or siRNAs, animals with eri-1 mutations accumulate more siRNAs than do wild-type animals. C. elegans ERI-1 and its human orthologue degrade siRNAs in vitro. In the nematode worm, ERI-1 is predominantly cytoplasmic and is expressed most highly in the gonad and a subset of neurons, suggesting that ERI-1 siRNase activity suppresses RNA interference more intensely in these tissues. Thus, ERI-1 is a negative regulator that may normally function to limit the duration, cell-type specificity or endogenous functions of RNA interference.
Defining the functional relationships between proteins is critical for understanding virtually all aspects of cell biology. Large-scale identification of protein complexes has provided one important step towards this goal; however, even knowledge of the stoichiometry, affinity and lifetime of every protein-protein interaction would not reveal the functional relationships between and within such complexes. Genetic interactions can provide functional information that is largely invisible to protein-protein interaction data sets. Here we present an epistatic miniarray profile (E-MAP) consisting of quantitative pairwise measurements of the genetic interactions between 743 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in various aspects of chromosome biology (including DNA replication/repair, chromatid segregation and transcriptional regulation). This E-MAP reveals that physical interactions fall into two well-represented classes distinguished by whether or not the individual proteins act coherently to carry out a common function. Thus, genetic interaction data make it possible to dissect functionally multi-protein complexes, including Mediator, and to organize distinct protein complexes into pathways. In one pathway defined here, we show that Rtt109 is the founding member of a novel class of histone acetyltransferases responsible for Asf1-dependent acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56. This modification, in turn, enables a ubiquitin ligase complex containing the cullin Rtt101 to ensure genomic integrity during DNA replication.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF), which can be purified from the mouse submaxillary gland or from pregnant human urine, is a potent multiplication-stimulating factor for several types of cultured cells, including human fibroblasts and glial cells. The molecule binds with high affinity and saturation kinetics to a cell-surface receptor, is subsequently internalised and finally degraded. The binding event is accompanied by a reduction in the number of EGF receptors. This phenomenon--'receptor down-regulation'--has been demonstrated with several hormones and may be a general principle for the modulation of binding groups on the outer cell surface. Further, it has been proposed that receptor loss acts to regulate the cellular response to the binding ligand. The present study provides direct experimental support for this hypothesis. It demonstrates that down-regulation of EGF receptors on glial cells causes desensitisation of the mitogenic response of these cells to subsequent stimulation with EGF.
The activity of serotonin N-acetyltransferase, the key enzyme of melatonin synthesis, shows a marked circadian rhythm in the pineal glands of various animal species. The regulation mechanism of the N-acetyltransferse rhythm in birds is different from that in mammals. N-Acetyltransferase activity in rat pineal gland is controlled by the central nervous system through the sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion, while in chicken the endogenous oscillator for N-acetyltransferase rhythm is presumably located in the pineal gland. Recently it has been shown that N-acetyltransferase activity oscillates in a circadian manner in the organ culture of chicken pineal glands. When chicken pineal glands were organ-cultured under continuous illumination, the nocturnal increase of enzyme activity was suppressed. These observations suggested that chicken pineal gland contains a circadian oscillator, a photoreceptor and melatonin-synthesising machinery. A central question arises whether the circadian oscillation of N-acetyltransferase activity and its response to environmental lighting are generated within the cell or are emergent properties of interaction between different types of pineal cells. I report here that in the dispersed cell culture of chicken pineal gland, N-acetyltransferase activity exhibits a circadian rhythm and responds to environmental lighting in the same manner as in the organ culture.
The engineering of genetic circuits with predictive functionality in living cells represents a defining focus of the expanding field of synthetic biology. This focus was elegantly set in motion a decade ago with the design and construction of a genetic toggle switch and an oscillator, with subsequent highlights that have included circuits capable of pattern generation, noise shaping, edge detection and event counting. Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level.
Fruitflies show robust attraction to food odours, which usually excite several glomeruli. To understand how the representation of such odours leads to behaviour, we used genetic tools to dissect the contribution of each activated glomerulus. Apple cider vinegar triggers robust innate attraction at a relatively low concentration, which activates six glomeruli. By silencing individual glomeruli, here we show that the absence of activity in two glomeruli, DM1 and VA2, markedly reduces attraction. Conversely, when each of these two glomeruli was selectively activated, flies showed as robust an attraction to vinegar as wild-type flies. Notably, a higher concentration of vinegar excites an additional glomerulus and is less attractive to flies. We show that activation of the extra glomerulus is necessary and sufficient to mediate the behavioural switch. Together, these results indicate that individual glomeruli, rather than the entire pattern of active glomeruli, mediate innate behavioural output.
Symmetrical visual patterns have a salient status in human perception, as evinced by their prevalent occurrence in art, and also in animal perception, where they may be an indicator of phenotypic and genotypic quality. Symmetry perception has been demonstrated in humans, birds, dolphins and apes. Here we show that bees trained to discriminate bilaterally symmetrical from non-symmetrical patterns learn the task and transfer it appropriately to novel stimuli, thus demonstrating a capacity to detect and generalize symmetry or asymmetry. We conclude that bees, and possibly flower-visiting insects in general, can acquire a generalized preference towards symmetrical or, alternatively, asymmetrical patterns depending on experience, and that symmetry detection is preformed or can be learned as perceptual category by insects, because it can be extracted as an independent visual pattern feature. Bees show a predisposition for learning and generalized symmetry because, if trained to it, they choose it more frequently, come closer to and hover longer in front of the novel symmetrical stimuli than the bees trained for asymmetry do for the novel asymmetrical stimuli. Thus, even organisms with comparatively small nervous systems can generalize about symmetry, and favour symmetrical over asymmetrical patterns.
The ability of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes to transmit Plasmodium parasites is highly variable between individuals. However, the genetic basis of this variability has remained unknown. We combined genome-wide mapping and reciprocal allele-specific RNA interference (rasRNAi) to identify the genomic locus that confers resistance to malaria parasites and demonstrated that polymorphisms in a single gene encoding the antiparasitic thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) explain a substantial part of the variability in parasite killing. The link between TEP1 alleles and resistance to malaria may offer new tools for controlling malaria transmission. The successful application of rasRNAi in Anopheles suggests that it could also be applied to other organisms where RNAi is feasible to dissect complex phenotypes to the level of individual quantitative trait alleles.
The transsynaptic induction of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (TH) in rat adrenal medulla is preceded by an early increase in the ratio of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate, an activation of cytosol cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and a subsequent translocation of protein kinase catalytic subunits from cytosol to subcellular particles. As a result of this translocation, nuclear protein kinase activity increases during the induction of TH. Transection of splanchnic nerve reverts these events and prevents the induction of TH. Thus, adrenal medulla activation and translocation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase may act as a long-range messenger for the genetic regulation of TH synthesis.
Despite the enormous ecological and economic importance of coral reefs, the keystone organisms in their establishment, the scleractinian corals, increasingly face a range of anthropogenic challenges including ocean acidification and seawater temperature rise. To understand better the molecular mechanisms underlying coral biology, here we decoded the approximately 420-megabase genome of Acropora digitifera using next-generation sequencing technology. This genome contains approximately 23,700 gene models. Molecular phylogenetics indicate that the coral and the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis diverged approximately 500 million years ago, considerably earlier than the time over which modern corals are represented in the fossil record (~240 million years ago). Despite the long evolutionary history of the endosymbiosis, no evidence was found for horizontal transfer of genes from symbiont to host. However, unlike several other corals, Acropora seems to lack an enzyme essential for cysteine biosynthesis, implying dependency of this coral on its symbionts for this amino acid. Corals inhabit environments where they are frequently exposed to high levels of solar radiation, and analysis of the Acropora genome data indicates that the coral host can independently carry out de novo synthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids, which are potent ultraviolet-protective compounds. In addition, the coral innate immunity repertoire is notably more complex than that of the sea anemone, indicating that some of these genes may have roles in symbiosis or coloniality. A number of genes with putative roles in calcification were identified, and several of these are restricted to corals. The coral genome provides a platform for understanding the molecular basis of symbiosis and responses to environmental changes.
Sperm design and function are important determinants of male reproductive success and are expected to be under strong selection. The way that spermatozoa phenotypes evolve is poorly understood, because there have been few studies of the quantitative genetics of sperm. Here we show, in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, an extraordinary degree of inter-male variation in sperm design that is independent of sperm swimming velocity. A quantitative genetics study using data from over 900 zebra finches in a complex breeding experiment showed that sperm head, mid-piece and flagellum length are heritable, that negative genetic correlations exist between sperm traits, and that significant indirect (maternal) genetic effects exist. Selection on the zebra finch sperm phenotype may be low because sperm competition is infrequent in this species, and this, in combination with negative genetic correlations and maternal genetic effects, may account for the variation in sperm phenotype between males. These results have important implications for the evolution of sperm in other taxa.
Chromosome 18 appears to have the lowest gene density of any human chromosome and is one of only three chromosomes for which trisomic individuals survive to term. There are also a number of genetic disorders stemming from chromosome 18 trisomy and aneuploidy. Here we report the finished sequence and gene annotation of human chromosome 18, which will allow a better understanding of the normal and disease biology of this chromosome. Despite the low density of protein-coding genes on chromosome 18, we find that the proportion of non-protein-coding sequences evolutionarily conserved among mammals is close to the genome-wide average. Extending this analysis to the entire human genome, we find that the density of conserved non-protein-coding sequences is largely uncorrelated with gene density. This has important implications for the nature and roles of non-protein-coding sequence elements.
Residents of the Tibetan Plateau show heritable adaptations to extreme altitude. We sequenced 50 exomes of ethnic Tibetans, encompassing coding sequences of 92% of human genes, with an average coverage of 18x per individual. Genes showing population-specific allele frequency changes, which represent strong candidates for altitude adaptation, were identified. The strongest signal of natural selection came from endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (EPAS1), a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia. One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at EPAS1 shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and Han samples, representing the fastest allele frequency change observed at any human gene to date. This SNP's association with erythrocyte abundance supports the role of EPAS1 in adaptation to hypoxia. Thus, a population genomic survey has revealed a functionally important locus in genetic adaptation to high altitude.
In Escherichia coli the genes coding for the 52 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) are organized into a number of transcription units located at various regions on the bacterial genome. The expression of r-protein genes is balanced so that individual r-protein synthesis rates change coordinately in response to changing environmental conditions, and significant amounts of free r-proteins do not exist in the cellular pool. We have suggested a model for the balanced regulation of r-protein gene expression, namely that r-protein synthesis and ribosome assembly are coupled so that r-proteins not incorporated into ribosomes prevent the further translation of r-protein mRNA by a feedback regulatory mechanism. The model was tested in vitro by examining the effect of purified r-proteins on DNA directed r-protein synthesis, and in vivo by examining the effect of overproduction of certain r-proteins on the synthesis rates of other r-proteins. In vitro experiments have revealed that some r-proteins (L1, L4, L10, S4 and S8) can selectively inhibit the synthesis of r-proteins whose genes are in the same operon as their own, and that this specific feedback regulation occurs at the level of translation rather than at the level of transcription of mRNA. Regulatory roles for L1, S4 and L4 have also been established by in vivo experiments. We have studied further the feedback regulatory properties of S8 in vivo and in vitro, and report here that the protein regulates a part of the spc operon.
Despite the sequencing of the human and mouse genomes, few genetic mechanisms for protecting against autoimmune disease are currently known. Here we systematically screen the mouse genome for autoimmune regulators to isolate a mouse strain, sanroque, with severe autoimmune disease resulting from a single recessive defect in a previously unknown mechanism for repressing antibody responses to self. The sanroque mutation acts within mature T cells to cause formation of excessive numbers of follicular helper T cells and germinal centres. The mutation disrupts a repressor of ICOS, an essential co-stimulatory receptor for follicular T cells, and results in excessive production of the cytokine interleukin-21. sanroque mice fail to repress diabetes-causing T cells, and develop high titres of autoantibodies and a pattern of pathology consistent with lupus. The causative mutation is in a gene of previously unknown function, roquin (Rc3h1), which encodes a highly conserved member of the RING-type ubiquitin ligase protein family. The Roquin protein is distinguished by the presence of a CCCH zinc-finger found in RNA-binding proteins, and localization to cytosolic RNA granules implicated in regulating messenger RNA translation and stability.
Juxtaposition between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria is a common structural feature, providing the physical basis for intercommunication during Ca(2+) signalling; yet, the molecular mechanisms controlling this interaction are unknown. Here we show that mitofusin 2, a mitochondrial dynamin-related protein mutated in the inherited motor neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type IIa, is enriched at the ER-mitochondria interface. Ablation or silencing of mitofusin 2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HeLa cells disrupts ER morphology and loosens ER-mitochondria interactions, thereby reducing the efficiency of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in response to stimuli that generate inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. An in vitro assay as well as genetic and biochemical evidences support a model in which mitofusin 2 on the ER bridges the two organelles by engaging in homotypic and heterotypic complexes with mitofusin 1 or 2 on the surface of mitochondria. Thus, mitofusin 2 tethers ER to mitochondria, a juxtaposition required for efficient mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake.
The mechanisms involved in the reprogramming of differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by the three transcription factors Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Klf4 and Sox2 remain poorly understood. The Ink4/Arf locus comprises the Cdkn2a-Cdkn2b genes encoding three potent tumour suppressors, namely p16(Ink4a), p19(Arf) and p15(Ink4b), which are basally expressed in differentiated cells and upregulated by aberrant mitogenic signals. Here we show that the locus is completely silenced in iPS cells, as well as in embryonic stem (ES) cells, acquiring the epigenetic marks of a bivalent chromatin domain, and retaining the ability to be reactivated after differentiation. Cell culture conditions during reprogramming enhance the expression of the Ink4/Arf locus, further highlighting the importance of silencing the locus to allow proliferation and reprogramming. Indeed, the three factors together repress the Ink4/Arf locus soon after their expression and concomitant with the appearance of the first molecular markers of 'stemness'. This downregulation also occurs in cells carrying the oncoprotein large-T, which functionally inactivates the pathways regulated by the Ink4/Arf locus, thus indicating that the silencing of the locus is intrinsic to reprogramming and not the result of a selective process. Genetic inhibition of the Ink4/Arf locus has a profound positive effect on the efficiency of iPS cell generation, increasing both the kinetics of reprogramming and the number of emerging iPS cell colonies. In murine cells, Arf, rather than Ink4a, is the main barrier to reprogramming by activation of p53 (encoded by Trp53) and p21 (encoded by Cdkn1a); whereas, in human fibroblasts, INK4a is more important than ARF. Furthermore, organismal ageing upregulates the Ink4/Arf locus and, accordingly, reprogramming is less efficient in cells from old organisms, but this defect can be rescued by inhibiting the locus with a short hairpin RNA. All together, we conclude that the silencing of Ink4/Arf locus is rate-limiting for reprogramming, and its transient inhibition may significantly improve the generation of iPS cells.
Glutamate transporters are integral membrane proteins that catalyse the concentrative uptake of glutamate from the synapse to intracellular spaces by harnessing pre-existing ion gradients. In the central nervous system glutamate transporters are essential for normal development and function, and are implicated in stroke, epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we present the crystal structure of a eukaryotic glutamate transporter homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii. The transporter is a bowl-shaped trimer with a solvent-filled extracellular basin extending halfway across the membrane bilayer. At the bottom of the basin are three independent binding sites, each cradled by two helical hairpins, reaching from opposite sides of the membrane. We propose that transport of glutamate is achieved by movements of the hairpins that allow alternating access to either side of the membrane.
The phenotypes caused by mutations in Wnt genes suggest that their gene products are involved in cell-to-cell communication. Wnt genes indeed encode secreted molecules, but soluble active Wnt protein has not been found. We have developed a novel cell culture assay for the Drosophila Wnt gene wingless, using a Drosophila imaginal disc cell line (cl-8; ref. 13), and measured effects on the adherens junction protein armadillo, a known genetic target of wingless. Transfection of a temperature-sensitive wingless complementary DNA into cl-8 cells increases the levels of the armadillo protein. The wingless protein does not affect the rate of synthesis of armadillo, but leads to increased stability of an otherwise rapidly decaying armadillo protein. The wingless protein in the extracellular matrix and soluble medium from donor cells also increases the levels of armadillo protein. The protein in the medium acts fast and is inhibited by an antibody to wingless protein, demonstrating that Wnt products can act as soluble extracellular signalling molecules.
The mole rat, Spalax ehrenberghi, is an extreme example of natural visual degeneration in mammals: visual pathways are regressed and incomplete, and the absence of visual cortical potentials or an overt behavioural response to light have led to the conclusion that Spalax is completely blind. But structural and molecular investigations of the atrophied, subcutaneous eye suggest a functional role for the retina in light perception, and entrainment of circadian locomotor and thermoregulatory rhythms by ambient light demonstrates a capacity for photoperiodic detection. We report here that severe regression of thalamic and tectal structures involved in form and motion perception is coupled to a selective hypertrophy of structures subserving photoperiodic functions. As an alternative to the prevalent view that ocular regression results from negative or nonselective evolutionary processes, the differential reduction and expansion of visual structures in Spalax can be explained as an adaptive response to the underground environment.
Immigrants to habitats occupied by conspecific organisms are usually expected to be competitively inferior, because residents may be locally adapted. If residents are inbred, however, mating between immigrants and residents results in offspring that may enjoy a fitness advantage from hybrid vigor. We demonstrate this effect experimentally in a natural Daphnia metapopulation in which genetic bottlenecks and local inbreeding are common. We estimate that in this metapopulation, hybrid vigor amplifies the rate of gene flow several times more than would be predicted from the nominal migration rate. This can affect the persistence of local populations and the entire metapopulation.
Strategies for assembling large, complex genomes have evolved to include a combination of whole-genome shotgun sequencing and hierarchal map-assisted sequencing. Whole-genome maps of all types can aid genome assemblies, generally starting with low-resolution cytogenetic maps and ending with the highest resolution of sequence. Fingerprint clone maps are based upon complete restriction enzyme digests of clones representative of the target genome, and ultimately comprise a near-contiguous path of clones across the genome. Such clone-based maps are used to validate sequence assembly order, supply long-range linking information for assembled sequences, anchor sequences to the genetic map and provide templates for closing gaps. Fingerprint maps are also a critical resource for subsequent functional genomic studies, because they provide a redundant and ordered sampling of the genome with clones. In an accompanying paper we describe the draft genome sequence of the chicken, Gallus gallus, the first species sequenced that is both a model organism and a global food source. Here we present a clone-based physical map of the chicken genome at 20-fold coverage, containing 260 contigs of overlapping clones. This map represents approximately 91% of the chicken genome and enables identification of chicken clones aligned to positions in other sequenced genomes.
Plasma transferrin is involved in iron transport within the circulatory system of vertebrates, and provides an iron source for haemoglobin synthesis and other metabolic requirements. However, despite extensive studies by spectroscopic, biochemical and physiological techniques, the nature of iron binding and the mechanisms of uptake and release of iron are not fully understood. Plasma transferrins are monomeric glycoproteins with a molecular weight of approximately 80,000 (ref. 2); they have two similar and very strong binding sites for Fe(III), together with two associated anion binding sites. Fragmentation studies on various transferrins have shown that the polypeptide chain is composed of two domains formed from the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the polypeptide chain. Each domain contains one metal binding site. The marked sequence similarities which exist between the two halves may reflect a doubling of an ancestral structural gene during the phylogenetic development of the protein. Preliminary crystallographic investigations of diferric rabbit plasma transferrin have been reported from this laboratory. We now report initial studies of the X-ray structure determination of dife-ric rabbit plasma transferrin which have led to a 6-A resolution electron density map.
The maturation of T cells in the thymus is dependent on the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. By disruption of the MHC class II Ab beta gene in embryonic stem cells, mice were generated that lack cell surface expression of class II molecules. These MHC class II-deficient mice were depleted of mature CD4+ T cells and were deficient in cell-mediated immune responses. These results provide genetic evidence that class II molecules are required for the maturation and function of mature CD4+ T cells.
Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease involving an interaction between an epigenetic event (possibly a viral infection), the pancreatic beta cells, and the immune system in a genetically susceptible host. The possibility that the type I interferons could mediate this interaction was tested with transgenic mice in which the insulin-producing beta cells expressed an interferon-alpha. These mice developed a hypoinsulinemic diabetes associated with a mixed inflammation centered on the islets. The inflammation and the diabetes were prevented with a neutralizing antibody to the interferon-alpha. Thus, the expression of interferon-alpha by the beta cells could be causal in the development of type I diabetes, which suggests a therapeutic approach to this disease.
The development of a patterned vasculature is essential for normal organogenesis. We found that signaling by semaphorin 3E (Sema3E) and its receptor plexin-D1 controls endothelial cell positioning and the patterning of the developing vasculature in the mouse. Sema3E is highly expressed in developing somites, where it acts as a repulsive cue for plexin-D1-expressing endothelial cells of adjacent intersomitic vessels. Sema3E-plexin-D1 signaling did not require neuropilins, which were previously presumed to be obligate Sema3 coreceptors. Moreover, genetic ablation of Sema3E or plexin-D1 but not neuropilin-mediated Sema3 signaling disrupted vascular patterning. These findings reveal an unexpected semaphorin signaling pathway and define a mechanism for controlling vascular patterning.
The synthetic polynucleotide poly[d(AT)].poly[d(AT)] is of interest in studies of the relationship between nucleic acid structure and function. In particular, A + T-rich regions in DNA double helices have been invoked as centres for controlling the transcription of genetic information. Here we describe conditions for observing by X-ray fibre diffraction the A, B, C and D conformations of Na-poly[d(AT)].poly[d(AT)], and for inducing transitions between these conformations. The D form emerges as a particularly stable conformation; once assumed, it persists over a wide range of variation in the relative humidity of the fibre environment. Further, while transitions between the B and D conformations are readily reversible, transitions between A and D are much more complex.
Genetic studies show that intercellular signalling is involved in key steps in Drosophila melanogaster development, but it has not previously been possible to investigate these processes in simplified in vitro systems. Analysis of engrailed (en) and wingless (wg) and other segment polarity genes suggests that two or more intercellular signalling processes may be involved in intrasegmental patterning. Expression of en and wg begins about three hours after egg laying, in adjacent rows of cells in the posterior half of each segmental primordium. In wg- embryos and in conditional mutants in which wg function is inactivated during a critical period between three and five hours after egg laying, early en expression begins normally but then disappears within several hours. The wg gene encodes a protein highly similar to the product of the mouse Wnt-1 proto-oncogene, a secreted glycoprotein; wg protein is proposed to function as an extracellular signal, maintaining en expression and activating other molecular and morphogenetic processes in nearby cells. Several lines of evidence support the model, including the secretion of wg protein in the embryo, genetic mosaic experiments and cell lineage studies. We tested this model using purified embryonic cells isolated by whole animal cell sorting, and validated three key predictions: (1) when en-expressing cells from early embryos are grown alone in culture, they rapidly and selectively lose en expression; (2) purified wg-expressing cells provide a locally active signal that prevents this loss; (3) heterologous cells engineered to express wg also show signalling activity, indicating that wg protein alone, or in conjunction with more generally expressed factors, is the signal.
Small isolated populations are frequently genetically less diverse than core populations, resulting in higher homozygosity that can hamper their long-term survival. The decrease in fitness of organisms owing to matings between relatives is well known from captive and laboratory animals. Such inbreeding can have strongly deleterious effects on life-history traits and survival, and can be critical to the success of population conservation. Because pedigrees are hard to follow in the wild, most field studies have used marker loci to establish that fitness declines with increasing homozygosity. Very few have experimentally explored the effects of inbreeding in the wild, or compared observations in the laboratory with field conditions. Here, using a technique involving the transfer of marker dusts during copulation, we show that a small decrease in mating success of captive inbred male butterflies in cages is greatly accentuated in conditions with unconstrained flight. Our results have important implications for conservation and for studies of sexual selection because they show that the behaviours underlying patterns of mating can be profoundly influenced by a history of inbreeding or by any restraining experimental conditions.
It has long been recognized that the absence of expression of products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) during early development might allow the fetus to escape recognition by maternal lymphocytes. In addition to the MHC class I heavy chain and beta 2-microglobulin, antigenic peptide is an essential structural component of the class I molecule. Indeed, there is evidence that MHC-linked genes encoding peptide transporter molecules and possibly components of a proteolytic complex are necessary for MHC class I assembly and stability at the cell surface. Here we demonstrate that embryonic cells in general show a defect in MHC class I assembly. Surface expression was rescued in the presence of an appropriate antigenic peptide, or by treatment with interferon. Consistent with this, HAM1 messenger RNA was not constitutively expressed, but was inducible by interferon, and during differentiation in vitro. Thus, tolerance of the fetal allograft may in part be controlled at the level of peptide-dependent MHC class I assembly.
The vagaries of history lead to the prediction that repeated instances of evolutionary diversification will lead to disparate outcomes even if starting conditions are similar. We tested this proposition by examining the evolutionary radiation of Anolis lizards on the four islands of the Greater Antilles. Morphometric analyses indicate that the same set of habitat specialists, termed ecomorphs, occurs on all four islands. Although these similar assemblages could result from a single evolutionary origin of each ecomorph, followed by dispersal or vicariance, phylogenetic analysis indicates that the ecomorphs originated independently on each island. Thus, adaptive radiation in similar environments can overcome historical contingencies to produce strikingly similar evolutionary outcomes.
Why do highly fecund organisms apparently sacrifice offspring size for increased numbers when offspring survival generally increases with size? The theoretical tools for understanding this evolutionary trade-off between number and size of offspring have developed over the past 25 years; however, the absence of data on the relation between offspring size and fitness in highly fecund species, which would control for potentially confounding variables, has caused such models to remain largely hypothetical. Here we manipulate egg size, controlling for maternal trait interactions, and determine the causal consequences of offspring size in a wild population of Atlantic salmon. The joint effect of egg size on egg number and offspring survival resulted in stabilizing phenotypic selection for an optimal size. The optimal egg size differed only marginally from the mean value observed in the population, suggesting that it had evolved mainly in response to selection on maternal rather than offspring fitness. We conclude that maximization of maternal fitness by sacrificing offspring survival may well be a general phenomenon among highly fecund organisms.
Although autism is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, attempts to identify specific susceptibility genes have thus far met with limited success. Genome-wide association studies using half a million or more markers, particularly those with very large sample sizes achieved through meta-analysis, have shown great success in mapping genes for other complex genetic traits. Consequently, we initiated a linkage and association mapping study using half a million genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a common set of 1,031 multiplex autism families (1,553 affected offspring). We identified regions of suggestive and significant linkage on chromosomes 6q27 and 20p13, respectively. Initial analysis did not yield genome-wide significant associations; however, genotyping of top hits in additional families revealed an SNP on chromosome 5p15 (between SEMA5A and TAS2R1) that was significantly associated with autism (P = 2 x 10(-7)). We also demonstrated that expression of SEMA5A is reduced in brains from autistic patients, further implicating SEMA5A as an autism susceptibility gene. The linkage regions reported here provide targets for rare variation screening whereas the discovery of a single novel association demonstrates the action of common variants.
Spinal muscular atrophy is one of the most common inherited forms of neurological disease leading to infant mortality. Patients have selective loss of lower motor neurons resulting in muscle weakness, paralysis and often death. Although patient fibroblasts have been used extensively to study spinal muscular atrophy, motor neurons have a unique anatomy and physiology which may underlie their vulnerability to the disease process. Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from skin fibroblast samples taken from a child with spinal muscular atrophy. These cells expanded robustly in culture, maintained the disease genotype and generated motor neurons that showed selective deficits compared to those derived from the child's unaffected mother. This is the first study to show that human induced pluripotent stem cells can be used to model the specific pathology seen in a genetically inherited disease. As such, it represents a promising resource to study disease mechanisms, screen new drug compounds and develop new therapies.
Although much is known about the bacterial genetics of early nodulation, little is known about the plant cell response. Alfalfa root hair cells were impaled with intracellular microelectrodes to measure a membrane potential depolarizing activity in Rhizobium meliloti cell-free filtrates, a plant response dependent on the bacterial nodulation genes. The depolarization was desensitized by repeated exposure to factors and was not observed in a representative nonlegume. A purified extracellular Nod factor, NodRm-IV(S), caused membrane potential depolarization at nanomolar concentrations. This rapid single-cell assay provides a tool for dissecting the mechanisms of host cell response in early nodulation.
A survey of China's plant biotechnologists shows that China is developing the largest plant biotechnology capacity outside of North America. The list of genetically modified plant technologies in trials, including rice, wheat, potatoes, and peanuts, is impressive and differs from those being worked on in other countries. Poor farmers in China are cultivating more area of genetically modified plants than are small farmers in any other developing country. A survey of agricultural producers in China demonstrates that Bacillus thuringiensis cotton adoption increases production efficiency and improves farmer health.
Organisms ranging from bacteria to humans synchronize their internal clocks to daily cycles of light and dark. Photic entrainment of the Drosophila clock is mediated by proteasomal degradation of the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). We have identified mutations in jetlag-a gene coding for an F-box protein with leucine-rich repeats-that result in reduced light sensitivity of the circadian clock. Mutant flies show rhythmic behavior in constant light, reduced phase shifts in response to light pulses, and reduced light-dependent degradation of TIM. Expression of JET along with the circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) in cultured S2R cells confers light-dependent degradation onto TIM, thereby reconstituting the acute response + of the circadian clock to light in a cell culture system. Our results suggest that JET is essential for resetting the clock by transmitting light signals from CRY to TIM.
Tibetans have lived at very high altitudes for thousands of years, and they have a distinctive suite of physiological traits that enable them to tolerate environmental hypoxia. These phenotypes are clearly the result of adaptation to this environment, but their genetic basis remains unknown. We report genome-wide scans that reveal positive selection in several regions that contain genes whose products are likely involved in high-altitude adaptation. Positively selected haplotypes of EGLN1 and PPARA were significantly associated with the decreased hemoglobin phenotype that is unique to this highland population. Identification of these genes provides support for previously hypothesized mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation and illuminates the complexity of hypoxia-response pathways in humans.
Protozoan parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa contain three genetic elements: the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes characteristic of virtually all eukaryotic cells and a 35-kilobase circular extrachromosomal DNA. In situ hybridization techniques were used to localize the 35-kilobase DNA of Toxoplasma gondii to a discrete organelle surrounded by four membranes. Phylogenetic analysis of the tufA gene encoded by the 35-kilobase genomes of coccidians T. gondii and Eimeria tenella and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum grouped this organellar genome with cyanobacteria and plastids, showing consistent clustering with green algal plastids. Taken together, these observations indicate that the Apicomplexa acquired a plastid by secondary endosymbiosis, probably from a green alga.
Tau proteins aggregate as cytoplasmic inclusions in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and hereditary frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Over 10 exonic and intronic mutations in the tau gene have been identified in about 20 FTDP-17 families. Analyses of soluble and insoluble tau proteins from brains of FTDP-17 patients indicated that different pathogenic mutations differentially altered distinct biochemical properties and stoichiometry of brain tau isoforms. Functional assays of recombinant tau proteins with different FTDP-17 missense mutations implicated all but one of these mutations in disease pathogenesis by reducing the ability of tau to bind microtubules and promote microtubule assembly.
The oligomeric IkappaB kinase (IKK) is composed of three polypeptides: IKKalpha and IKKbeta, the catalytic subunits, and IKKgamma, a regulatory subunit. IKKalpha and IKKbeta are similar in structure and thought to have similar function-phosphorylation of the IkappaB inhibitors in response to proinflammatory stimuli. Such phosphorylation leads to degradation of IkappaB and activation of nuclear factor kappaB transcription factors. The physiological function of these protein kinases was explored by analysis of IKKalpha-deficient mice. IKKalpha was not required for activation of IKK and degradation of IkappaB by proinflammatory stimuli. Instead, loss of IKKalpha interfered with multiple morphogenetic events, including limb and skeletal patterning and proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes.
Post-transcriptional gene regulation frequently occurs through elements in mRNA 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Although crucial roles for 3'UTR-mediated gene regulation have been found in Caenorhabditis elegans, most C. elegans genes have lacked annotated 3'UTRs. Here we describe a high-throughput method for reliable identification of polyadenylated RNA termini, and we apply this method, called poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-Seq), to determine C. elegans 3'UTRs. Compared to standard methods also recently applied to C. elegans UTRs, 3P-Seq identified 8,580 additional UTRs while excluding thousands of shorter UTR isoforms that do not seem to be authentic. Analysis of this expanded and corrected data set suggested that the high A/U content of C. elegans 3'UTRs facilitated genome compaction, because the elements specifying cleavage and polyadenylation, which are A/U rich, can more readily emerge in A/U-rich regions. Indeed, 30% of the protein-coding genes have mRNAs with alternative, partially overlapping end regions that generate another 10,480 cleavage and polyadenylation sites that had gone largely unnoticed and represent potential evolutionary intermediates of progressive UTR shortening. Moreover, a third of the convergently transcribed genes use palindromic arrangements of bidirectional elements to specify UTRs with convergent overlap, which also contributes to genome compaction by eliminating regions between genes. Although nematode 3'UTRs have median length only one-sixth that of mammalian 3'UTRs, they have twice the density of conserved microRNA sites, in part because additional types of seed-complementary sites are preferentially conserved. These findings reveal the influence of cleavage and polyadenylation on the evolution of genome architecture and provide resources for studying post-transcriptional gene regulation.
Two decades of research have not established whether tropical insect herbivores are dominated by specialists or generalists. This impedes our understanding of species coexistence in diverse rainforest communities. Host specificity and species richness of tropical insects are also key parameters in mapping global patterns of biodiversity. Here we analyse data for over 900 herbivorous species feeding on 51 plant species in New Guinea and show that most herbivorous species feed on several closely related plant species. Because species-rich genera are dominant in tropical floras, monophagous herbivores are probably rare in tropical forests. Furthermore, even between phylogenetically distant hosts, herbivore communities typically shared a third of their species. These results do not support the classical view that the coexistence of herbivorous species in the tropics is a consequence of finely divided plant resources; non-equilibrium models of tropical diversity should instead be considered. Low host specificity of tropical herbivores reduces global estimates of arthropod diversity from 31 million (ref. 1) to 4 6 million species. This finding agrees with estimates based on taxonomic collections, reconciling an order of magnitude discrepancy between extrapolations of global diversity based on ecological samples of tropical communities with those based on sampling regional faunas.
Neurons are thought to use diverse families of cell-surface molecules for cell recognition during circuit assembly. In Drosophila, alternative splicing of the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene potentially generates 38,016 closely related transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily, each comprising one of 19,008 alternative ectodomains linked to one of two alternative transmembrane segments. These ectodomains show isoform-specific homophilic binding, leading to speculation that Dscam proteins mediate cell recognition. Genetic studies have established that Dscam is required for neural circuit assembly, but the extent to which isoform diversity contributes to this process is not known. Here we provide conclusive evidence that Dscam diversity is essential for circuit assembly. Using homologous recombination, we reduced the entire repertoire of Dscam ectodomains to just a single isoform. Neural circuits in these mutants are severely disorganized. Furthermore, we show that it is crucial for neighbouring neurons to express distinct isoforms, but that the specific identity of the isoforms expressed in an individual neuron is unimportant. We conclude that Dscam diversity provides each neuron with a unique identity by which it can distinguish its own processes from those of other neurons, and that this self-recognition is essential for wiring the Drosophila brain.
Rhinoviruses belong to the picornavirus family and cause about 50% of common colds. Most rhinoviruses and some coxsackie viruses share a common receptor on human cells. The glycoprotein intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) has recently been identified as the cellular receptor for the subgroup of rhinoviruses known as the major groups. ICAM-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family and is a ligand for lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1); these ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions are critical to many cell adhesion processes involved in the immunological response. Because anti-ICAM-1 antibodies can block binding of major-group rhinoviruses to cells, we considered that antagonism of virus-receptor interaction might be a way of preventing rhinovirus infection. We have constructed and purified a soluble form of the ICAM-1 molecule, which is normally membrane-bound, and demonstrated that it is a potent and specific inhibitor of rhinovirus infection.
Hydrogen bonds commonly lend robustness and directionality to molecular recognition processes and supramolecular structures. In particular, the two or three hydrogen bonds in Watson-Crick base pairs bind the double-stranded DNA helix and determine the complementarity of the pairing. Watson and Crick pointed out, however, that the possible tautomers of base pairs, in which hydrogen atoms become attached to the donor atom of the hydrogen bond, might disturb the genetic code, as the tautomer is capable of pairing with different partners. But the dynamics of hydrogen bonds in general, and of this tautomerization process in particular, are not well understood. Here we report observations of the femtosecond dynamics of tautomerization in model base pairs (7-azaindole dimers) containing two hydrogen bonds. Because of the femtosecond resolution of proton motions, we are able to examine the cooperativity of formation of the tautomer (in which the protons on each base are shifted sequentially to the other base), and to determine the characteristic timescales of the motions in a solvent-free environment. We find that the first step occurs on a timescale of a few hundred femtoseconds, whereas the second step, to form the full tautomer, is much slower, taking place within several picoseconds; the timescales are changed significantly by replacing hydrogen with deuterium. These results establish the molecular basis of the dynamics and the role of quantum tunnelling.
Failure of normal brain development leads to mental retardation or autism in about 3% of children. Many genes integral to pathways by which synaptic modification and the remodelling of neuronal networks mediate cognitive and social development have been identified, usually through loss of function. Evidence is accumulating, however, that either loss or gain of molecular functions can be deleterious to the nervous system. Copy-number variation, regulation of gene expression by non-coding RNAs and epigenetic changes are all mechanisms by which altered gene dosage can cause the failure of neuronal homeostasis.
When the fruiting myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca, a gliding prokaryote, is starved on an agar surface, the cells form multicellular aggregates resulting from morphogenetic movements. In the presence of incandescent light, each aggregate develops into a structurally complex fruiting body, possessing a stalk and several sporangia. In contrast, this pattern of development is not seen when cultures are incubated in the dark. The cells form irregular interconnecting aggregates, which rarely develop into fruits. However, aggregates formed in the light will develop into fruits even if placed in the dark, suggesting that the light produced a relatively stable alteration in the phenotype of the cells.
Leptothorax acervorum, L. muscorum, and L. nylanderi recruit nest mates to a new food source by tandem running, with only one nest mate being recruited at a time. This technique is initiated by a special "tandem calling" behavior; the recruiter slants its gaster upward and discharges poison gland secretions from the extruded sting. Nest mates are attracted, and as soon as one of them touches the calling ant, tandem running starts. Further details of the full recruitment sequence are provided. Evidence is presented to suggest that tandem running is the evolutionary precursor of odor-trail communication and sex attraction within certain phylogenetic lines of myrmicine ants.
The effective use of targeted therapy is highly dependent on the identification of responder patient populations. Loss of FBW7, which encodes a tumour-suppressor protein, is frequently found in various types of human cancer, including breast cancer, colon cancer and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). In line with these genomic data, engineered deletion of Fbw7 in mouse T cells results in T-ALL, validating FBW7 as a T-ALL tumour suppressor. Determining the precise molecular mechanisms by which FBW7 exerts antitumour activity is an area of intensive investigation. These mechanisms are thought to relate in part to FBW7-mediated destruction of key proteins relevant to cancer, including Jun, Myc, cyclin E and notch 1 (ref. 9), all of which have oncoprotein activity and are overexpressed in various human cancers, including leukaemia. In addition to accelerating cell growth, overexpression of Jun, Myc or notch 1 can also induce programmed cell death. Thus, considerable uncertainty surrounds how FBW7-deficient cells evade cell death in the setting of upregulated Jun, Myc and/or notch 1. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(FBW7) (a SKP1-cullin-1-F-box complex that contains FBW7 as the F-box protein) governs cellular apoptosis by targeting MCL1, a pro-survival BCL2 family member, for ubiquitylation and destruction in a manner that depends on phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3. Human T-ALL cell lines showed a close relationship between FBW7 loss and MCL1 overexpression. Correspondingly, T-ALL cell lines with defective FBW7 are particularly sensitive to the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib but resistant to the BCL2 antagonist ABT-737. On the genetic level, FBW7 reconstitution or MCL1 depletion restores sensitivity to ABT-737, establishing MCL1 as a therapeutically relevant bypass survival mechanism that enables FBW7-deficient cells to evade apoptosis. Therefore, our work provides insight into the molecular mechanism of direct tumour suppression by FBW7 and has implications for the targeted treatment of patients with FBW7-deficient T-ALL.
The functional heart is comprised of distinct mesoderm-derived lineages including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. Studies in the mouse embryo and the mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation model have provided evidence indicating that these three lineages develop from a common Flk-1(+) (kinase insert domain protein receptor, also known as Kdr) cardiovascular progenitor that represents one of the earliest stages in mesoderm specification to the cardiovascular lineages. To determine whether a comparable progenitor is present during human cardiogenesis, we analysed the development of the cardiovascular lineages in human embryonic stem cell differentiation cultures. Here we show that after induction with combinations of activin A, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, also known as FGF2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, also known as VEGFA) and dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1) in serum-free media, human embryonic-stem-cell-derived embryoid bodies generate a KDR(low)/C-KIT(CD117)(neg) population that displays cardiac, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle potential in vitro and, after transplantation, in vivo. When plated in monolayer cultures, these KDR(low)/C-KIT(neg) cells differentiate to generate populations consisting of greater than 50% contracting cardiomyocytes. Populations derived from the KDR(low)/C-KIT(neg) fraction give rise to colonies that contain all three lineages when plated in methylcellulose cultures. Results from limiting dilution studies and cell-mixing experiments support the interpretation that these colonies are clones, indicating that they develop from a cardiovascular colony-forming cell. Together, these findings identify a human cardiovascular progenitor that defines one of the earliest stages of human cardiac development.
Pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells is controlled by defined transcription factors. During differentiation, mouse ES cells undergo global epigenetic reprogramming, as exemplified by X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in which one female X chromosome is silenced to achieve gene dosage parity between the sexes. Somatic XCI is regulated by homologous X-chromosome pairing and counting, and by the random choice of future active and inactive X chromosomes. XCI and cell differentiation are tightly coupled, as blocking one process compromises the other and dedifferentiation of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells is accompanied by X chromosome reactivation. Recent evidence suggests coupling of Xist expression to pluripotency factors occurs, but how the two are interconnected remains unknown. Here we show that Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) lies at the top of the XCI hierarchy, and regulates XCI by triggering X-chromosome pairing and counting. Oct4 directly binds Tsix and Xite, two regulatory noncoding RNA genes of the X-inactivation centre, and also complexes with XCI trans-factors, Ctcf and Yy1 (ref. 17), through protein-protein interactions. Depletion of Oct4 blocks homologous X-chromosome pairing and results in the inactivation of both X chromosomes in female cells. Thus, we have identified the first trans-factor that regulates counting, and ascribed new functions to Oct4 during X-chromosome reprogramming.
The gametophytic maternal effect mutant medea (mea) shows aberrant growth regulation during embryogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Embryos derived from mea eggs grow excessively and die during seed desiccation. Embryo lethality is independent of the paternal contribution and gene dosage. The mea phenotype is consistent with the parental conflict theory for the evolution of parent-of-origin-specific effects. MEA encodes a SET domain protein similar to Enhancer of zeste, a member of the Polycomb group. In animals, Polycomb group proteins ensure the stable inheritance of expression patterns through cell division and regulate the control of cell proliferation.
Werner's syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease in which the affected individuals display symptoms of premature ageing. The substantial phenotypic overlap between WS and normal ageing indicates that these two conditions may have pathogenetic mechanisms in common. The WS mutation has pleiotropic effects, and patients and their cells show many differences compared with normals. Despite extensive study of the clinical and biochemical features of this disorder, the primary genetic defect remains unknown. We have undertaken a genetic linkage study in an effort to identify the locus of the primary defect. Here we report close genetic linkage of the WS mutation to a group of markers on chromosome 8.
The pathways that control insulin secretion and regulate pancreatic beta-cell mass are crucial in the development of diabetes mellitus. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young comprises a number of single-gene disorders affecting pancreatic beta-cell function, and the consequences of mutations in these genes are so serious that diabetes develops in childhood or adolescence. A genetic basis for the more common form of type 2 diabetes, which affects 10-20% of adults in many developed countries, is less clear cut. It is also characterized by abnormal beta-cell function, but other tissues are involved as well. However, in both forms identification of causative and susceptibility genes are providing new insight into the control of insulin action and secretion, as well as suggesting new treatments for diabetes.
Cell cycle-regulated gene expression is essential for normal cell growth and development and loss of stringent growth control is associated with the acquisition of the transformed phenotype. The selective synthesis of histone proteins during the S phase of the cell cycle is required to render cells competent for the ordered packaging of replicating DNA into chromatin. Regulation of H4 histone gene transcription requires the proliferation-specific promoter binding factor HiNF-D. In normal diploid cells, HiNF-D binding activity is regulated during the cell cycle; nuclear protein extracts prepared from normal cells in S phase contain distinct and measurable HiNF-D binding activity, while this activity is barely detectable in G1 phase cells. In contrast, in tumor-derived or transformed cell lines, HiNF-D binding activity is constitutively elevated throughout the cell cycle and declines only with the onset of differentiation. The change from cell cycle-mediated to constitutive interaction of HiNF-D with the promoter of a cell growth-controlled gene is consistent with, and may be functionally related to, the loss of stringent cell growth regulation associated with neoplastic transformation.
Type III restriction/modification enzyme recognize short, non-palindromic sequences that can be methylated on only one strand, with the paradoxical consequence that during replication of what is in effect hemimethylated DNA totally unmodified sites arise. Why the unmodified sites are not subject to suicidal restriction was not clear. Here we show that restriction requires two unmodified recognition sites that can be separated by different distances but which must be in inverse orientation. All of the unmodified sites in newly replicated DNA are of course in the same orientation, which explains why they are not restricted. This result may be of relevance to other manifestations of anisotropy in double-stranded DNA, such as genetic imprinting.
We first report discovery of the spinel-garnet-orthopyroxene granulite with pure CO2 fluid inclusions from the Fuyun region of the late Paleozoic Altay orogenic belt in Central Asia, NW China. The rock is characterized by an assemblage of garnet, orthopyroxene, spinel, cordierite, biotite, plagioclase and quartz. Symplectites of orthopyroxene and spinel, and orthopyroxene and cordierite indicate decompression under UHT conditions. Mineral chemistry shows that the orthopyroxenes have high XMg and Al2O3 contents (up to 9.23 wt%). Biotites are enriched in TiO2 and XMg and are stable under granulite facies conditions. The garnet and quartz from the rock carry monophase fluid inclusions which show peak melting temperatures of around -56.7 degrees C, indicating a pure CO2 species being presented during the ultrahigh-T metamorphism in the Altay orogenic belt. The inclusions homogenize into a liquid phase at temperatures around 15.3-23.8 degrees C translating into CO2 densities of the order of 0.86-0.88 g/cm3. Based on preliminary mineral paragenesis, reaction textures and petrogenetic grid considerations, we infer that the rock was subjected to UHT conditions. The CO2-rich fluids were trapped during exhumation along a clockwise P-T path following isothermal decompression under UHT conditions.
Linkage analysis of ten Utah kindreds and one Texas kindred with multiple cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) provided evidence that a locus for familial melanoma susceptibility is in the chromosomal region 9p13-p22. The genetic markers analyzed reside in a candidate region on chromosome 9p21, previously implicated by the presence of homozygous deletions in melanoma tumors and by the presence of a germline deletion in an individual with eight independent melanomas. Multipoint linkage analysis was performed between the familial melanoma susceptibility locus (MLM) and two short tandem repeat markers, D9S126 and the interferon-alpha (IFNA) gene, which reside in the region of somatic loss in melanoma tumors. An analysis incorporating a partially penetrant dominant melanoma susceptibility locus places MLM near IFNA and D9S126 with a maximum location score of 12.71. Therefore, the region frequently deleted in melanoma tumors on 9p21 presumably contains a locus that plays a critical role in predisposition to familial melanoma.
In contrast to planets with masses similar to that of Jupiter and higher, the bulk compositions of planets in the so-called super-Earth regime (masses 2-10 times that of the Earth) cannot be uniquely determined from a measurement of mass and radius alone. For these planets, there is a degeneracy between the mass and composition of both the interior and a possible atmosphere in theoretical models. The recently discovered transiting super-Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b is one example of this problem. Three distinct models for the planet that are consistent with its mass and radius have been suggested. Breaking the degeneracy between these models requires obtaining constraints on the planet's atmospheric composition. Here we report a ground-based measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b between wavelengths of 780 and 1,000 nm. The lack of features in this spectrum rules out (at 4.9s confidence) cloud-free atmospheres composed primarily of hydrogen. If the planet's atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, then it must contain clouds or hazes that are optically thick at the observed wavelengths at pressures less than 200 mbar. Alternatively, the featureless transmission spectrum is also consistent with the presence of a dense, water vapour atmosphere.
Diploid and diploid-triploid mosaic individuals of Platemys platycephala were found in natural populations. In mosaic specimens, the blood, spleen, liver, and testis contained both diploid and triploid cells. The ratio of triploid to diploid cells was more variable among individuals than among somatic tissues within an individual. Only diploid cells underwent meiosis in males; haploid gametes were produced. There appears to be geographic variation for mosaicism in that only diploids were found in Bolivia, whereas diploids and diploid-triploid mosaics occured in Surinam.
Adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) is an X-linked disorder characterized by primary adrenal insufficiency. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HHG) is frequently associated with this disorder but is thought not to be caused by the low adrenal androgen levels due to adrenal hypoplasia. It is uncertain whether there are two distinct yet physically linked genes responsible for AHC and HHG or a single gene responsible for both diseases. AHC can occur as a part of a contiguous deletion syndrome together with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and/or glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD). From the analysis of deletions, the following gene order has been deduced: Xpter-AHC-GKD-DMD-cen. An AHC critical region of 200-500 kilobases has been defined by physical mapping and partially overlaps with a 160-kilobase dosage-sensitive sex (DSS) reversal critical region. The DAX-1 (DSS-AHC critical region on the X, gene 1) gene was isolated and found to encode a new member of the nuclear hormone receptor family. Here we report that DAX-1 is deleted in 14 patients and point mutations were found in the coding region in DNA from 12 unrelated individuals. All AHC patients over 14 years old and with only point mutations in DAX-1 were also diagnosed with HHG, confirming that the DAX-1 gene is responsible for both X-linked AHC and HHG. But in four sporadic cases and a single familial case, no point mutations were found, suggesting genetic heterogeneity or differential expression of DAX-1.
Variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences are used to link defendants with crimes by matching DNA patterns. The probative value of a match is often calculated by multiplying together the estimated frequencies with which each particular VNTR pattern occurs in a reference database. However, this method is liable to potentially serious errors because ethnic subgroups within major racial categories exhibit genetic differences that are maintained by endogamy. The multiplication procedure currently in use can be made scientifically valid only by extensive sampling of VNTR frequency distributions in a variety of ethnic groups, similar to the ethnic studies of various blood groups done in the past. Alternative approaches for dealing with subpopulation heterogeneity are discussed.
Recent discoveries in the science of ageing indicate that lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematodes, flies and mice is plastic and can be manipulated by genetic, nutritional or pharmacological intervention. A better understanding of the targets of such interventions, as well as the proximate causes of ageing-related degeneration and disease, is essential before we can evaluate if abrogation of human senescence is a realistic prospect.
Of nine studies in vitro, six have indicated some degree of induced chromosomal breakage after exposure to LSD; three failed to confirm these results. The damage, when found, was generally of the chromatid type, arising during or after DNA synthesis. This damage, with one exception, was the result of concentrations of drug and durations of exposure which could not be achieved in humans with reasonable dosages. There did not appear to be a dose-response relation. The magnitude of damage, when found, was in the range encompassing the effects of many commonly used substances. The absence in vitro of excretory and detoxifying systems present in vivo, as well as several negative reports, cast doubt on the relevance of in vitro results. In 21 chromosomal studies in vivo, 310 subjects were examined. Of these, 126 were treated with pure LSD; the other 184 were exposed to illicit, "alleged" LSD. A maximum of only 18 of 126 (14.29 percent) of the subjects in the group exposed to pure LSD showed higher frequency of chromosome aberration than the controls. In contrast, a maximum of 90 of 184 (48.91 percent) of the subjects taking illicit LSD showed an increase in frequency of aberrations. Of all the subjects reported to have chromosome damage, only 18 of the 108 (16.67 percent) were exposed to pure LSD. The frequency of individuals with chromosomal damage reported among illicit drug users was more than triple that associated with the use of pharmacologically pure LSD. We conclude that chromosome damage, when found, was related to the effects of drug abuse in general and not, as initially reported, to LSD alone. We believe that pure LSD ingested in moderate dosages does not produce chromosome damage detectable by available methods. No significant work on carcinogenic potential of LSD has been reported so far. No cause-and-effect relation and no increase in the incidence of neoplasia among LSD users have been demonstrated. Case reports (three in 4.0 years) of leukemia and other neoplasia in this population are rare. The results of early chromosome studies suggested that true genetic damage might be a consequence of LSD exposure. The comprehensive evidence from studies on drosophila indicates no mutagenic effect from 0.28 to 500 microg of LSD per milliliter and a definite mutagenic effect from 2,000 to 10,000 microg/ml; this is consistent with a threshold response or a sigmoid dose-effect relation. We believe that LSD is, in fact, a weak mutagen, effective only in extremely high doses; it is unlikely to be mutagenic in any concentration used by human subjects. Circular dichroism experiments suggested that the specific mechanism of action of LSD on DNA may be a direct interaction resulting in conformational changes in the DNA helix. These changes are unlikely to result in a decrease of internal stability sufficient to cause breakage of chromosomes, but they may be the physical basis of the weak mutagenicity. Early chromosomal studies implicated LSD as a potential cause of congenital malformations, fetal wastage, and germinal chromosome damage. First reports of a teratogenic effect in hamsters and rats have not been confirmed. A review of 15 rodent studies indicated a wide range of individual, strain, and species susceptibility to the effects of LSD. The applicability of such investigations to man is doubtful. In a study of human pregnancies, those exposed to illicit LSD had an elevated rate of spontaneous abortions. There is no reported instance of a malformed child born to a woman who ingested pure LSD; there are six cases of malformation associated with exposure to illicit LSD, four of which have similar limb defects. Given, however, the high frequency of unexplained "spontaneous" birth defects, the rare occurrence of malformed infants born to women who used illicit LSD may be coincidental. While there is no evidence that pure LSD is teratogenic in man, the use of any drug during pregnancy requires that its potential benefits significantly outweigh its potential hazards. From our own work and from a review of the literature, we believe that pure LSD ingested in moderate doses does not damage chromosomes in vivo, does not cause detectable genetic damage, and is not a teratogen or a carcinogen in man. Within these bounds, therefore, we suggest that, other than during pregnancy, there is no present contraindication to the continued controlled experimental use of pure LSD. Note added in proof: A brief review has been brought to our attention. Although based on a sample of only 15 studies the author reached conclusions similar to our own (92).
Feather-pecking in domestic birds is associated with cannibalism and severe welfare problems. It is a dramatic example of a spiteful behaviour in which the victim's fitness is reduced for no immediate direct benefit to the perpetrator and its evolution is unexplained. Here we show that the plumage pigmentation of a chicken may predispose it to become a victim: birds suffer more drastic feather-pecking when the colour of their plumage is due to the expression of a wild recessive allele at PMEL17, a gene that controls plumage melanization, and when these birds are relatively common in a flock. These findings, obtained using an intercross between a domestic fowl and its wild ancestor, have implications for the welfare of domestic species and offer insight into the genetic changes associated with the evolution of feather-pecking during the early stages of domestication.
The stable inheritance of genetic material depends on accurate DNA partition. Plasmids serve as tractable model systems to study DNA segregation because they require only a DNA centromere, a centromere-binding protein and a force-generating ATPase. The centromeres of partition (par) systems typically consist of a tandem arrangement of direct repeats. The best-characterized par system contains a centromere-binding protein called ParR and an ATPase called ParM. In the first step of segregation, multiple ParR proteins interact with the centromere repeats to form a large nucleoprotein complex of unknown structure called the segrosome, which binds ParM filaments. pSK41 ParR binds a centromere consisting of multiple 20-base-pair (bp) tandem repeats to mediate both transcription autoregulation and segregation. Here we report the structure of the pSK41 segrosome revealed in the crystal structure of a ParR-DNA complex. In the crystals, the 20-mer tandem repeats stack pseudo-continuously to generate the full-length centromere with the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) fold of ParR binding successive DNA repeats as dimer-of-dimers. Remarkably, the dimer-of-dimers assemble in a continuous protein super-helical array, wrapping the DNA about its positive convex surface to form a large segrosome with an open, solenoid-shaped structure, suggesting a mechanism for ParM capture and subsequent plasmid segregation.
Reactive oxygen species are required for cell proliferation but can also induce apoptosis. In proliferating cells this paradox is solved by the activation of protein kinase B (PKB; also known as c-Akt), which protects cells from apoptosis. By contrast, it is unknown how quiescent cells that lack PKB activity are protected against cell death induced by reactive oxygen species. Here we show that the PKB-regulated Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a (also known as FKHR-L1) protects quiescent cells from oxidative stress by directly increasing their quantities of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) messenger RNA and protein. This increase in protection from reactive oxygen species antagonizes apoptosis caused by glucose deprivation. In quiescent cells that lack the protective mechanism of PKB-mediated signalling, an alternative mechanism is induced as a consequence of PKB inactivity. This mechanism entails the activation of Forkhead transcription factors, the transcriptional activation of MnSOD and the subsequent reduction of reactive oxygen species. Increased resistance to oxidative stress is associated with longevity. The model of Forkhead involvement in regulating longevity stems from genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans, and we conclude that this model also extends to mammalian systems.
The biochemical and morphological differentiation of actinomycetes makes them academically and economically interesting. Their secondary metabolites provide the majority of medically and agriculturally important antibiotics (streptomycete genes may also be the primary source of clinically important antibiotic resistance); their complex morphological developmental cycle involves a series of changes from vegetative mycelial growth to spore formation. Recombinant DNA technology would add a powerful new dimension to the analysis of these various aspects of actinomycete biology and would also facilitate the development of industrial strains with increased antibiotic yield, or capable of making new antibiotics. For most of these purposes, cloning of genes within and between actinomycetes is required to study the expression of particular genes in genetic backgrounds defined by mutations of the characters under study. To achieve this, we have now developed a method for molecular cloning involving the transfer of genes between unrelated streptomycetes.
The evolutionary origin of rodents is obscured by the group's sudden and highly transformed first appearance in the fossil record in the latest Paleocene. We report here the discovery of nearly complete dental remains of an extraordinary new primitive rodent from strata of transitional Paleocene-Eocene age in Inner Mongolia, China. The strikingly conservative morphological features of this taxon, Tribosphenomys minutus, gen. et sp. nov., substantially modify previous ideas about the ancestral rodent morphotype, which in turn has important implications for understanding the origin of rodents and their relationship to other eutherian mammals. This new fossil, in conjunction with recent morphological and molecular evidence confirming rodent monophyly, indicates the need for a reassessment of phylogenetic affinities among gliriform eutherians. Our results indicate a sister-group position of the new taxon to other rodents, and support the alliance of lagomorphs (rabbits) and rodents (cohort Glires). They also suggest that paraphyly of an extinct assemblage, the 'Eurymylidae', and reveal an unexpectedly complex pattern of character evolution near the ancestry of Rodentia.
African trypanosomes activate, one at a time, a large set of genes coding for different variant-specific surface antigens (VSAs). These genes have been classed into two groups. In the first group a permanently silent basic gene copy is duplicated and the expression-linked copy (ELC) transposed to an expression site located at a chromosome end. The process is a gene conversion which changes a variable stretch of the preceding ELC. Genes belonging to the second group do not give rise to an additional copy when expressed by a still unknown mechanism. We report here that the gene for antigenic type AnTat 1.6 is located in a telomeric DNA region and is expressed without being duplicated. In clone AnTat 1.6 and the ensuing ones, the ELC of the preceding VSA (AnTat 1.3) is conserved, but in a inactive conformation. Moreover, the AnTat 1.6 gene is lost from the genome of the AnTat 1.6-derived variants, in which the duplication-linked mechanism of gene activation occurs: the gene appears to be replaced by the incoming ELC. These observations show that a trypanosome surface antigen repertoire may evolve by loss and gain of VSA genes, depending on the alternation of the different recombinational mechanism involved in antigenic variation.
The structure of the complex involving one polyadenylic acid and two polyinosinic acid chains has been determined by x-ray diffraction. The three coaxial, helical chains have conformations like conventional RNA double helices despite the absence of purine-pyrimidine pairing. Formation of hypoxanthine pairs in codon-anticodon interactions therefore requires only trivial changes in the conformation of a standard nucleotide. Evolution of the contemporary genetic code involving purine-pyrimidine complementarity from a primeval code with only adenine-hypoxanthine pairing would have been possible without major discontinuities in molecular geometry.
We describe a map of 1.42 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed throughout the human genome, providing an average density on available sequence of one SNP every 1.9 kilobases. These SNPs were primarily discovered by two projects: The SNP Consortium and the analysis of clone overlaps by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium. The map integrates all publicly available SNPs with described genes and other genomic features. We estimate that 60,000 SNPs fall within exon (coding and untranslated regions), and 85% of exons are within 5 kb of the nearest SNP. Nucleotide diversity varies greatly across the genome, in a manner broadly consistent with a standard population genetic model of human history. This high-density SNP map provides a public resource for defining haplotype variation across the genome, and should help to identify biomedically important genes for diagnosis and therapy.
Evolved mechanisms for assessing genetic relatedness have been found in many species, but their existence in humans has been a matter of controversy. Here we report three converging lines of evidence, drawn from siblings, that support the hypothesis that kin detection mechanisms exist in humans. These operate by computing, for each familiar individual, a unitary regulatory variable (the kinship index) that corresponds to a pairwise estimate of genetic relatedness between self and other. The cues that the system uses were identified by quantitatively matching individual exposure to potential cues of relatedness to variation in three outputs relevant to the system's evolved functions: sibling altruism, aversion to personally engaging in sibling incest, and moral opposition to third party sibling incest. As predicted, the kin detection system uses two distinct, ancestrally valid cues to compute relatedness: the familiar other's perinatal association with the individual's biological mother, and duration of sibling coresidence.
Changes in protein-protein interactions may allow polypeptides to perform unexpected regulatory functions. Mammalian ShcA docking proteins have amino-terminal phosphotyrosine (pTyr) binding (PTB) and carboxyl-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which recognize specific pTyr sites on activated receptors, and a central region with two phosphorylated tyrosine-X-asparagine (pYXN) motifs (where X represents any amino acid) that each bind the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) adaptor. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ShcA may signal through both pYXN-dependent and -independent pathways. We show that, in mice, cardiomyocyte-expressed ShcA directs mid-gestational heart development by a PTB-dependent mechanism that does not require the pYXN motifs. In contrast, the pYXN motifs are required with PTB and SH2 domains in the same ShcA molecule for the formation of muscle spindles, skeletal muscle sensory organs that regulate motor behavior. Thus, combinatorial differences in ShcA docking interactions may yield multiple signaling mechanisms to support diversity in tissue morphogenesis.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in eukaryotes guide post-transcriptional regulation by means of targeted RNA degradation and translational arrest. They are released by a Dicer nuclease as a 21-24-nucleotide RNA duplex from a precursor in which an imperfectly matched inverted repeat forms a partly double-stranded region. One of the two strands is then recruited by an Argonaute nuclease that is the effector protein of the silencing mechanism. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are similar to miRNAs, are also produced by Dicer but the precursors are perfectly double-stranded RNA. These siRNAs guide post-transcriptional regulation, as with miRNAs, and epigenetic genome modification. Diverse eukaryotes including fungi, plants, protozoans and metazoans produce siRNAs but, until now, miRNAs have not been described in unicellular organisms and it has been suggested that they evolved together with multicellularity in separate plant and animal lineages. Here we show that the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains miRNAs, putative evolutionary precursors of miRNAs and species of siRNAs resembling those in higher plants. The common features of miRNAs and siRNAs in an alga and in higher plants indicate that complex RNA-silencing systems evolved before multicellularity and were a feature of primitive eukaryotic cells.
Ammonium persulfate, a common polymerizing agent for acrylamide gels, can inactivate yeast enolase and produce increased electrophoretic heterogeneity during disc electrophoresis in gels containing 8M urea. The use of riboflavin and light for polymerization or thioglycolate for removal of the persulfate are feasible alternatives.
There is considerable public and scientific debate for and against genetically modified (GM) crops. One of the first GM crops, Brassica napus (oilseed rape or canola) is now widely grown in North America, with proposed commercial release into Australia and Europe. Among concerns of opponents to these crops are claims that pollen movement will cause unacceptable levels of gene flow from GM to non-GM crops or to related weedy species, resulting in genetic pollution of the environment. Therefore, quantifying pollen-mediated gene flow is vital for assessing the environmental impact of GM crops. This study quantifies at a landscape level the gene flow that occurs from herbicide-resistant canola crops to nearby crops not containing herbicide resistance genes.
Plants, similarly to animals, form polarized axes during embryogenesis on which cell differentiation and organ patterning programs are orchestrated. During Arabidopsis embryogenesis, establishment of the shoot and root stem cell populations occurs at opposite ends of an apical-basal axis. Recent work has identified the PLETHORA (PLT) genes as master regulators of basal/root fate, whereas the master regulators of apical/shoot fate have remained elusive. Here we show that the PLT1 and PLT2 genes are direct targets of the transcriptional co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) and that PLT1/2 are necessary for the homeotic conversion of shoots to roots in tpl-1 mutants. Using tpl-1 as a genetic tool, we identify the CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIP III) transcription factors as master regulators of embryonic apical fate, and show they are sufficient to drive the conversion of the embryonic root pole into a second shoot pole. Furthermore, genetic and misexpression studies show an antagonistic relationship between the PLT and HD-ZIP III genes in specifying the root and shoot poles.
Some main-sequence stars of spectral type A are observed to have a strong (0.03-3 tesla), static, large-scale magnetic field, of a chiefly dipolar shape: they are known as 'Ap stars', such as Alioth, the fifth star in the Big Dipper. Following the discovery of these fields, it was proposed that they are remnants of the star's formation, a 'fossil' field. An alternative suggestion is that they could be generated by a dynamo process in the star's convective core. The dynamo hypothesis, however, has difficulty explaining high field strengths and the observed lack of a correlation with rotation. The weakness of the fossil-field theory has been the absence of field configurations stable enough to survive in a star over its lifetime. Here we report numerical simulations that show that stable magnetic field configurations, with properties agreeing with those observed, can develop through evolution from arbitrary, unstable initial fields. The results are applicable equally to Ap stars, magnetic white dwarfs and some highly magnetized neutron stars known as magnetars. This establishes fossil fields as the natural, unifying explanation for the magnetism of all these stars.
The ribosome is formed by assembly of proteins and nucleic acids, and synthesizes proteins according to genetic instructions in all organisms. Many of the biochemical steps of this fundamental process are known, but a detailed understanding requires a well-defined structural model of the ribosome. Electron microscopy combined with image reconstruction of two-dimensional crystals or single ribosomes has been the most promising technique, but the resolution of the resulting models has been insufficient. Here we report a 25-A reconstruction of the ribosome from Escherichia coli, obtained by combining 4,300 projections of ice-embedded single particles. Our new reconstruction reveals a channel in the small ribosomal subunit and a bifurcating tunnel in the large subunit which may constitute pathways for the incoming message and the nascent polypeptide chain, respectively. Based on these new findings, a three-dimensional model of the basic framework of protein synthesis is presented.
A single-base pair resolution silkworm genetic variation map was constructed from 40 domesticated and wild silkworms, each sequenced to approximately threefold coverage, representing 99.88% of the genome. We identified ~16 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms, many indels, and structural variations. We find that the domesticated silkworms are clearly genetically differentiated from the wild ones, but they have maintained large levels of genetic variability, suggesting a short domestication event involving a large number of individuals. We also identified signals of selection at 354 candidate genes that may have been important during domestication, some of which have enriched expression in the silk gland, midgut, and testis. These data add to our understanding of the domestication processes and may have applications in devising pest control strategies and advancing the use of silkworms as efficient bioreactors.
Microbes comprise the majority of extant organisms, yet much remains to be learned about the nature and driving forces of microbial diversification. Our understanding of how microorganisms adapt and evolve can be advanced by genome-wide documentation of the patterns of genetic exchange, particularly if analyses target coexisting members of natural communities. Here we use community genomic data sets to identify, with strain specificity, expressed proteins from the dominant member of a genomically uncharacterized, natural, acidophilic biofilm. Proteomics results reveal a genome shaped by recombination involving chromosomal regions of tens to hundreds of kilobases long that are derived from two closely related bacterial populations. Inter-population genetic exchange was confirmed by multilocus sequence typing of isolates and of uncultivated natural consortia. The findings suggest that exchange of large blocks of gene variants is crucial for the adaptation to specific ecological niches within the very acidic, metal-rich environment. Mass-spectrometry-based discrimination of expressed protein products that differ by as little as a single amino acid enables us to distinguish the behaviour of closely related coexisting organisms. This is important, given that microorganisms grouped together as a single species may have quite distinct roles in natural systems and their interactions might be key to ecosystem optimization. Because proteomic data simultaneously convey information about genome type and activity, strain-resolved community proteomics is an important complement to cultivation-independent genomic (metagenomic) analysis of microorganisms in the natural environment.
Direct reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be achieved by overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc transcription factors, but only a minority of donor somatic cells can be reprogrammed to pluripotency. Here we demonstrate that reprogramming by these transcription factors is a continuous stochastic process where almost all mouse donor cells eventually give rise to iPS cells on continued growth and transcription factor expression. Additional inhibition of the p53/p21 pathway or overexpression of Lin28 increased the cell division rate and resulted in an accelerated kinetics of iPS cell formation that was directly proportional to the increase in cell proliferation. In contrast, Nanog overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a predominantly cell-division-rate-independent manner. Quantitative analyses define distinct cell-division-rate-dependent and -independent modes for accelerating the stochastic course of reprogramming, and suggest that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency.
The phenotypic differences between individual organisms can often be ascribed to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical organisms in homogeneous environments vary, indicating that randomness in developmental processes such as gene expression may also generate diversity. To examine the consequences of gene expression variability in multicellular organisms, we studied intestinal specification in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which wild-type cell fate is invariant and controlled by a small transcriptional network. Mutations in elements of this network can have indeterminate effects: some mutant embryos fail to develop intestinal cells, whereas others produce intestinal precursors. By counting transcripts of the genes in this network in individual embryos, we show that the expression of an otherwise redundant gene becomes highly variable in the mutants and that this variation is subjected to a threshold, producing an ON/OFF expression pattern of the master regulatory gene of intestinal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that mutations in developmental networks can expose otherwise buffered stochastic variability in gene expression, leading to pronounced phenotypic variation.
Population biologists have long been interested in the oscillations in population size displayed by many organisms in the field and laboratory. A wide range of deterministic mathematical models predict that these fluctuations can be generated internally by nonlinear interactions among species and, if correct, would provide important insights for understanding and predicting the dynamics of interacting populations. We studied the dynamical behavior of a two-species aquatic laboratory community encompassing the interactions between a demographically structured herbivore population, a primary producer, and a mineral resource, yet still amenable to description and parameterization using a mathematical model. The qualitative dynamical behavior of our experimental system, that is, cycles, equilibria, and extinction, is highly predictable by a simple nonlinear model.
The discovery of TATA-binding protein-related factors (TRFs) has suggested alternative mechanisms for gene-specific transcriptional regulation and raised interest in their biological functions. In contrast to recent observations of an embryonic lethal phenotype for TRF2 inactivation in Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus laevis, we found that Trf2-deficient mice are viable. However, Trf2-/- mice are sterile because of a severe defect in spermiogenesis. Postmeiotic round spermatids advance at most to step 7 of differentiation but fail to progress to the elongated form, and gene-specific transcription deficiencies were identified. We speculate that mammals may have evolved more specialized TRF2 functions in the testis that involve transcriptional regulation of genes essential for spermiogenesis.
The origin of paired appendages was a major evolutionary innovation for vertebrates, marking the first step towards fin- (and later limb-) driven locomotion. The earliest vertebrate fossils lack paired fins but have well-developed median fins, suggesting that the mechanisms of fin development were assembled first in the midline. Here we show that shark median fin development involves the same genetic programs that operate in paired appendages. Using molecular markers for different cell types, we show that median fins arise predominantly from somitic (paraxial) mesoderm, whereas paired appendages develop from lateral plate mesoderm. Expression of Hoxd and Tbx18 genes, which specify paired limb positions, also delineates the positions of median fins. Proximodistal development of median fins occurs beneath an apical ectodermal ridge, the structure that controls outgrowth of paired appendages. Each median fin bud then acquires an anteroposteriorly-nested pattern of Hoxd expression similar to that which establishes skeletal polarity in limbs. Thus, despite their different embryonic origins, paired and median fins utilize a common suite of developmental mechanisms. We extended our analysis to lampreys, which diverged from the lineage leading to gnathostomes before the origin of paired appendages, and show that their median fins also develop from somites and express orthologous Hox and Tbx genes. Together these results suggest that the molecular mechanisms for fin development originated in somitic mesoderm of early vertebrates, and that the origin of paired appendages was associated with re-deployment of these mechanisms to lateral plate mesoderm.
Both C kappa regions in MPC 11 cells are rearranged into active transcripion units, one producing a normal kappa chain and the other an internally deleted kappa fragment lacking a V region. The gene coding for the kappa fragment mRNA is aberrantly rearranged and lacks a site for V leads to C kappa splicing. An alternative splicing event which deletes the V region from the nuclear RNA precursor generates the kappa fragment mRNA.
In female mammals, fertility declines abruptly at an advanced age. The human menopause is one example, but reproductive cessation has also been documented in non-human primates, rodents, whales, dogs, rabbits, elephants and domestic livestock. The human menopause has been considered an evolutionary adaptation, assuming that elderly women avoid the increasing complications of continued childbirth to better nurture their current children and grandchildren. But an abrupt reproductive decline might be only a non-adaptive by-product of life-history patterns. Because so many individuals die from starvation, disease and predation, detrimental genetic traits can persist (or even be favoured) as long as their deleterious effects are delayed until an advanced age is reached, and, for a given pattern of mortality, there should be an age by which selection would be too weak to prevent the onset of reproductive senescence. We provide a systematic test of these alternatives using field data from two species in which grandmothers frequently engage in kin-directed behaviour. Both species show abrupt age-specific changes in reproductive performance that are characteristic of menopause. But elderly females do not suffer increased mortality costs of reproduction, nor do post-reproductive females enhance the fitness of grandchildren or older children. Instead, reproductive cessation appears to result from senescence.
Transfer RNA (tRNA) suppression of nonsense mutations in prokaryotic systems has been widely used to study the structure and function of different prokaryotic genes. Through genetic engineering techniques, it is now possible to introduce suppressor (Su+) tRNA molecules into mammalian cells. A quantitative assay of the suppressor tRNA activity in these mammalian cells is described; it is based on the amount of tRNA-mediated readthrough of a terminating codon in the influenza virus NS1 gene after the cells are infected with virus. Suppressor activity in L cells continuously expressing Su+ (tRNAtyr) was 3.5 percent and that in CV-1 cells infected with an SV40- Su+ (tRNAtyr) recombinant was 22.5 percent.
Astrocytes are the most abundant and functionally diverse glial population in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). However, the mechanisms underlying astrocyte specification are poorly understood. It is well established that cellular diversification of neurons in the embryo is generated by position-dependent extrinsic signals and combinatorial interactions of transcription factors that direct specific cell fates by suppressing alternative fates. It is unknown whether a comparable process determines embryonic astrocyte identity. Indeed, astrocyte development is generally thought to take place in a position-independent manner. Here we show multiple functions of Stem cell leukaemia (Scl, also known as Tal1), which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, in the regulation of both astrocyte versus oligodendrocyte cell fate acquisition and V2b versus V2a interneuron cell fate acquisition in the p2 domain of the developing vertebrate spinal cord. Our findings demonstrate a regionally restricted transcriptional programme necessary for astrocyte and V2b interneuron development, with striking parallels to the involvement of SCL in haematopoiesis. They further indicate that acquisition of embryonic glial subtype identity might be regulated by genetic interactions between SCL and the transcription factor Olig2 in the ventral neural tube.
A cytoplasmically inherited genetic element in yeast, [PSI+], was confirmed to be a prionlike aggregate of the cellular protein Sup35 by differential centrifugation analysis and microscopic localization of a Sup35-green fluorescent protein fusion. Aggregation depended on the intracellular concentration and functional state of the chaperone protein Hsp104 in the same manner as did [PSI+] inheritance. The amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains of Sup35 contributed to the unusual behavior of [PSI+]. [PSI+] altered the conformational state of newly synthesized prion proteins, inducing them to aggregate as well, thus fulfilling a major tenet of the prion hypothesis.
Samples of Andropogon scoparius Michx. collected on an arsenic mine exhibited a wide range of tolerance to arsenic in solution, whereas plants of the same species growing in uncontaminated soil showed no tolerance. Arsenic tolerance must be an evolved character under genetic control. Furthermore, the degree of tolerance is related to the amount of arsenic in which the plant was growing.
Extensive work on the maturation of lagging strands during the replication of simian virus 40 DNA suggests that the initiator RNA primers of Okazaki fragments are removed by the combined action of two nucleases, RNase HI and Fen1, before the Okazaki fragments join. Despite the well established in vitro roles of these two enzymes, genetic analyses in yeast revealed that null mutants of RNase HI and/or Fen1 are not lethal, suggesting that an additional enzymatic activity may be required for the removal of RNA. One such enzyme is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dna2 helicase/endonuclease, which is essential for cell viability and is well suited to removing RNA primers of Okazaki fragments. In addition, Dna2 interacts genetically and physically with several proteins involved in the elongation or maturation of Okazaki fragments. Here we show that the endonucleases Dna2 and Fen1 act sequentially to facilitate the complete removal of the primer RNA. The sequential action of these enzymes is governed by a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, replication protein-A (RPA). Our results demonstrate that the processing of Okazaki fragments in eukaryotes differs significantly from, and is more complicated than, that occurring in prokaryotes. We propose a novel biochemical mechanism for the maturation of eukaryotic Okazaki fragments.
Obesity is now so common within the world's population that it is beginning to replace undernutrition and infectious diseases as the most significant contributor to ill health. In particular, obesity is associated with diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, certain forms of cancer, and sleep-breathing disorders. Obesity is defined by a body-mass index (weight divided by square of the height) of 30 kg m(-2) or greater, but this does not take into account the morbidity and mortality associated with more modest degrees of overweight, nor the detrimental effect of intra-abdominal fat. The global epidemic of obesity results from a combination of genetic susceptibility, increased availability of high-energy foods and decreased requirement for physical activity in modern society. Obesity should no longer be regarded simply as a cosmetic problem affecting certain individuals, but an epidemic that threatens global well being.
Ecological and evolutionary dynamics can occur on similar timescales. However, theoretical predictions of how rapid evolution can affect ecological dynamics are inconclusive and often depend on untested model assumptions. Here we report that rapid prey evolution in response to oscillating predator density affects predator-prey (rotifer-algal) cycles in laboratory microcosms. Our experiments tested explicit predictions from a model for our system that allows prey evolution. We verified the predicted existence of an evolutionary tradeoff between algal competitive ability and defence against consumption, and examined its effects on cycle dynamics by manipulating the evolutionary potential of the prey population. Single-clone algal cultures (lacking genetic variability) produced short cycle periods and typical quarter-period phase lags between prey and predator densities, whereas multi-clonal (genetically variable) algal cultures produced long cycles with prey and predator densities nearly out of phase, exactly as predicted. These results confirm that prey evolution can substantially alter predator-prey dynamics, and therefore that attempts to understand population oscillations in nature cannot neglect potential effects from ongoing rapid evolution.
In the briefing "Plants can be patented now" by Marjorie Sun (News and Comment, 18 Oct., p. 303), it was incorrectly reported that the American Type Culture Collection does not have the facilities to accept plant genetic material. The depository did not have that capability when Molecular Genetics Research and Development Limited Partnership filed its patent application for a genetically engineered corn plant, but it has the facilities now.
The mariner transposable element is a small member of the short inverted terminal repeat class thought to transpose through a DNA intermediate. Originally described in Drosophila mauritiana, it is now known in several species of the family Drosophilidae, and in a moth Hyalophora cecropia. Here I use primers designed to represent regions of amino-acid conservation between the putative transposase genes of the D. mauritiana and H. cecropia elements to amplify equivalent regions of presumed mariner elements from ten other insects representing six additional orders, including the malaria-vector mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. Sequences of multiple clones from each species reveal a diverse array of mariner elements, with multiple subfamilies in the genomes of some insects, indicating both vertical inheritance and horizontal transfers. An intact open reading frame in at least one clone from each species suggests each may carry functional transposable elements. Therefore the mariner element is an excellent candidate for development of genetic transformation systems for non-drosophilid insects, and possibly other arthropods.
Molecular biology has revolutionized the understanding of many aspects of human disease. Ongoing developments in DNA diagnostics--the analysis of disease at the nucleic acid level--will soon provide automated, rapid, and inexpensive analyses for DNA or RNA sequences associated with genetic, malignant, and infectious diseases. DNA diagnostics will also facilitate the identification of disease-associated genes at birth, thus creating new opportunities for preventive medicine.
To determine if defects in the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) system can cause hypertension, mice were generated with a disruption of the proANP gene. Homozygous mutants had no circulating or atrial ANP, and their blood pressures were elevated by 8 to 23 millimeters of mercury when they were fed standard (0.5 percent sodium chloride) and intermediate (2 percent sodium chloride) salt diets. On standard salt diets, heterozygotes had normal amounts of circulating ANP and normal blood pressures. However, on high (8 percent sodium chloride) salt diets they were hypertensive, with blood pressures elevated by 27 millimeters of mercury. These results demonstrate that genetically reduced production of ANP can lead to salt-sensitive hypertension.
Cell fusion experiments have been carried out with Chinese hamster cell mutants with different nutritional growth requirements. Conditions have been devised in which approximately 1 to 2 percent of the cell population remaining after fusion are fused, hybrid cells. The all-or-none nature of the genetic markers employed and the extremely low reversion rates insure that no contamination of the hybrid population with parental forms occurs. Hybrids between glycine- and hypoxanthine-requiring mutants are prototrophic, which indicates that both mutations are recessive. Hybrids between a glycine-deficient mutant and a singlestep mutant which requires glycine, hypoxanthine, and thymidine are relieved of the glycine dependency, an indication that the two loci associated with glycine dependence are different. This mutation to the triple-supplement requirement as well as a proline deficiency were also shown to be recessive mutations. The system appears applicable to a variety of genetic problems.
Interspecific mutualisms are regarded as having evolved from antagonistic or commensalistic interactions, with most mutualisms remaining facultative but some having coevolved into obligate reciprocal dependency. Underlying mutualism is an intrinsic conflict between the parties, in that each is under selection for increased exploitation of the other. Theoretical models suggest that this conflict is a source of evolutionary instability, and that evolution of 'cheating' by one party may lead to reciprocal extinction. Here we present phylogenic evidence for reversal of an obligate mutualism: within the yucca moth complex, distinct cheater species derived from obligate pollinators inflict a heavy cost on their yucca hosts by laying their eggs but not pollinating the yucca. Phylogenetic data show the cheaters to have existed for a long time. Coexisting pollinators and cheaters are not sister taxa, supporting predictions that evolution of cheating within a single pollinator is evolutionarily unstable. Several lines of evidence support a hypothesis that host shifts preceded the reversal of obligate mutualism. Host or partner shifts is a mechanism that can provide a route of evolutionary escape among obligate mutualists in general.
The childhood-onset spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs) describe a heterogeneous group of disorders that selectively affect the alpha motoneuron. We have shown that chronic childhood-onset SMA (SMA II and III) maps to a single locus on chromosome 5q. Acute SMA (SMA Type I/Werdnig-Hoffmann/severe/infantile) is the main cause of heritable infant mortality. Mapping the acute SMA locus by conventional methods is complicated by the rapidly fatal course of the disease and its recessive mode of inheritance. We present here the typing of four inbred acute-SMA families with DNA markers on chromosome 5q and analysis of these together with acute families from our previous study to demonstrate genetic homogeneity between the acute and chronic forms of SMA. The data indicate that the acute SMA locus maps to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3. Two families seem unlinked to 5q markers, raising the possibility of genetic heterogeneity or disease misclassification within the acute and chronic family sets.
Biosynthesis of the DNA base thymine depends on activity of the enzyme thymidylate synthase to catalyse the methylation of the uracil moiety of 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate. All known thymidylate synthases rely on an active site residue of the enzyme to activate 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate. This functionality has been demonstrated for classical thymidylate synthases, including human thymidylate synthase, and is instrumental in mechanism-based inhibition of these enzymes. Here we report an example of thymidylate biosynthesis that occurs without an enzymatic nucleophile. This unusual biosynthetic pathway occurs in organisms containing the thyX gene, which codes for a flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS), and is present in several human pathogens. Our findings indicate that the putative active site nucleophile is not required for FDTS catalysis, and no alternative nucleophilic residues capable of serving this function can be identified. Instead, our findings suggest that a hydride equivalent (that is, a proton and two electrons) is transferred from the reduced flavin cofactor directly to the uracil ring, followed by an isomerization of the intermediate to form the product, 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate. These observations indicate a very different chemical cascade than that of classical thymidylate synthases or any other known biological methylation. The findings and chemical mechanism proposed here, together with available structural data, suggest that selective inhibition of FDTSs, with little effect on human thymine biosynthesis, should be feasible. Because several human pathogens depend on FDTS for DNA biosynthesis, its unique mechanism makes it an attractive target for antibiotic drugs.
Class II molecules encoded by the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are involved in regulating T-cell response to antigens. The mechanisms for generating polymorphism in products of the MHC have been studied extensively for both the murine H-2 and the human HLA complex. Such studies indicate that point mutations plus selection have a major role in the generation of polymorphisms of class I and class II MHC genes. However, a non-reciprocal gene conversion mechanism has been proposed to explain several examples of clustered sequence variation in MHC genes. In all these examples, the proposed gene conversion event is unidirectional; that is, one of the two interacting genes acts as sequence donor and the other as sequence recipient. No examples of potential reciprocal genetic exchange (as occurs in the fungal system), in which the two interacting genes act as both donor and recipient of gene fragments, have been found in the MHC system or in other multigene families of higher organisms. We sequenced two different HLA-DR beta complementary DNAs from each of two different cells all expressing the same serologically defined determinant (DR2) but different T-cell-recognized (Dw) specificities (Dw12 and MN2). Sequence comparisons of these four cDNA clones (and two DR beta amino-acid sequences from the DR2-Dw2 subtype) suggest that new coding sequences for DR beta molecules in the DR2 haplotypes are potentially generated by reciprocal intergenic exchange.
Transfer of genes between plant species has played an important role in crop improvement for many decades. Useful traits such as resistance to disease, insects, and stress have been transferred to crop varieties from noncultivated plants. Recombinant DNA methods greatly extend (even outside the plant kingdom) the sources from which genetic information can be obtained for crop improvement. Gene transfer systems based on recombinant DNA are available for several crop species and are under development for others. The concerted use of traditional and more recent methods for plant genetic manipulation will contribute to crop improvement.
Studies of the genetic basis of behaviour in mice are at a turning point. Soon, new resources will enable the behavioural function of all genes to be tested and the networks of genes, messenger RNAs and proteins involved in a particular behaviour to be identified. Using these resources, scientists will be able to analyse mouse behaviour at an unprecedented level of detail. Interpreting the new data, however, will require a shift in focus from gene-based approaches to network-based approaches.
Fluorescence markers on chromosome numbers 3, 13, and 14 gave cytological evidence of the paternal origin of the extra haploid set in a premature triploid infant with XXY sex chromosome complement. The mother had discontinued the use of oral contraceptives 13 months prior to conception. It is not possible to tell whether the mechanism involved was fertilization by dispermy or by a diploid sperm.
We have introduced a cloned Ek alpha gene into embryos of mice incapable of expressing their endogenous E alpha genes. The transcription of Ek alpha was accurate and tissue-specific in the resulting transgenic lines and, in macrophages, Ek alpha transcription could be induced by gamma-interferon. The injected gene conferred on the genetically deficient host strain the ability to mount an immune response to a synthetic polymer.
Colonization of the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients by the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the principal cause of mortality in CF populations. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections generally persist despite the use of long-term antibiotic therapy. This has been explained by postulating that P. aeruginosa forms an antibiotic-resistant biofilm consisting of bacterial communities embedded in an exopolysaccharide matrix. Alternatively, it has been proposed that resistant P. aeruginosa variants may be selected in the CF respiratory tract by antimicrobial therapy itself. Here we report that both explanations are correct, and are interrelated. We found that antibiotic-resistant phenotypic variants of P. aeruginosa with enhanced ability to form biofilms arise at high frequency both in vitro and in the lungs of CF patients. We also identified a regulatory protein (PvrR) that controls the conversion between antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible forms. Compounds that affect PvrR function could have an important role in the treatment of CF infections.
We report the presence of serum cryoimmunoglobulins in patients with attacks of a newly described epidemic arthritis--Lyme arthritis--and in some patients with a characteristic skin lesion--erythema chronicum migrans--that sometimes precedes the onset of the arthritis. Seven patients who had cryoimmunoglobulins at the time of the skin lesion have developed arthritis; four patients without them have not. The cryoglobulins in patients with the skin lesion consisted primarily of immunoglobulin M (IgM); those in patients with arthritis often included both IgM and IgG. These findings support the hypothesis that a common origin exists for the skin and joint lesions and suggest that circulating immune complexes may have a pathogenetic role in Lyme arthritis.
Niemann-Pick type C2 disease (NP-C2) is a fatal hereditary disorder of unknown etiology characterized by defective egress of cholesterol from lysosomes. Here we show that the disease is caused by a deficiency in HE1, a ubiquitously expressed lysosomal protein identified previously as a cholesterol-binding protein. HE1 was undetectable in fibroblasts from NP-C2 patients but present in fibroblasts from unaffected controls and NP-C1 patients. Mutations in the HE1 gene, which maps to chromosome 14q24.3, were found in NP-C2 patients but not in controls. Treatment of NP-C2 fibroblasts with exogenous recombinant HE1 protein ameliorated lysosomal accumulation of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol.
Explosive volcanic eruptions are driven by exsolution of H2O-rich vapour from silicic magma. Eruption dynamics involve a complex interplay between nucleation and growth of vapour bubbles and crystallization, generating highly nonlinear variation in the physical properties of magma as it ascends beneath a volcano. This makes explosive volcanism difficult to model and, ultimately, to predict. A key unknown is the temperature variation in magma rising through the sub-volcanic system, as it loses gas and crystallizes en route. Thermodynamic modelling of magma that degasses, but does not crystallize, indicates that both cooling and heating are possible. Hitherto it has not been possible to evaluate such alternatives because of the difficulty of tracking temperature variations in moving magma several kilometres below the surface. Here we extend recent work on glassy melt inclusions trapped in plagioclase crystals to develop a method for tracking pressure-temperature-crystallinity paths in magma beneath two active andesite volcanoes. We use dissolved H2O in melt inclusions to constrain the pressure of H2O at the time an inclusion became sealed, incompatible trace element concentrations to calculate the corresponding magma crystallinity and plagioclase-melt geothermometry to determine the temperature. These data are allied to ilmenite-magnetite geothermometry to show that the temperature of ascending magma increases by up to 100 degrees C, owing to the release of latent heat of crystallization. This heating can account for several common textural features of andesitic magmas, which might otherwise be erroneously attributed to pre-eruptive magma mixing.
Understanding the biology that underlies histologically similar but molecularly distinct subgroups of cancer has proven difficult because their defining genetic alterations are often numerous, and the cellular origins of most cancers remain unknown. We sought to decipher this heterogeneity by integrating matched genetic alterations and candidate cells of origin to generate accurate disease models. First, we identified subgroups of human ependymoma, a form of neural tumour that arises throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Subgroup-specific alterations included amplifications and homozygous deletions of genes not yet implicated in ependymoma. To select cellular compartments most likely to give rise to subgroups of ependymoma, we matched the transcriptomes of human tumours to those of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), isolated from different regions of the CNS at different developmental stages, with an intact or deleted Ink4a/Arf locus (that encodes Cdkn2a and b). The transcriptome of human supratentorial ependymomas with amplified EPHB2 and deleted INK4A/ARF matched only that of embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf(-/-) NSCs. Notably, activation of Ephb2 signalling in these, but not other, NSCs generated the first mouse model of ependymoma, which is highly penetrant and accurately models the histology and transcriptome of one subgroup of human supratentorial tumour. Further, comparative analysis of matched mouse and human tumours revealed selective deregulation in the expression and copy number of genes that control synaptogenesis, pinpointing disruption of this pathway as a critical event in the production of this ependymoma subgroup. Our data demonstrate the power of cross-species genomics to meticulously match subgroup-specific driver mutations with cellular compartments to model and interrogate cancer subgroups.
Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have activating mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, and most patients with GISTs respond well to Gleevec, which inhibits KIT kinase activity. Here we show that approximately 35% (14 of 40) of GISTs lacking KIT mutations have intragenic activation mutations in the related receptor tyrosine kinase, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA). Tumors expressing KIT or PDGFRA oncoproteins were indistinguishable with respect to activation of downstream signaling intermediates and cytogenetic changes associated with tumor progression. Thus, KIT and PDGFRA mutations appear to be alternative and mutually exclusive oncogenic mechanisms in GISTs.
We have investigated age-related reactivation of the X chromosome by devising a model in which reactivation of a single gene in one cell among many can be identified. We have used mice with an X-autosomal translocation giving consistent non-random inactivation of the normal X (as judged by biochemical and cytogenetic techniques), that also carry a defective form of a histochemically demonstrable X-linked enzyme. When the gene for the normal enzyme was located on the inactivated normal X a uniformly negative histochemical picture would be predicted in doubly heterozygous animals. A very small proportion of enzyme-positive cells was found in young animals. This proportion increased very significantly with age, but the patch size did not change, showing that the result was not due to preferential division of enzyme-positive cells, but was instead due to the conversion of previously enzyme-negative to enzyme-positive cells. These observations provide the first evidence with a true X-linked gene for an age-related decrease in the stability of the X-inactivation mechanism.
Genetic instability was one of the first characteristics to be postulated to underlie neoplasia. Such genetic instability occurs in two different forms. In a small fraction of colorectal and some other cancers, defective repair of mismatched bases results in an increased mutation rate at the nucleotide level and consequent widespread microsatellite instability. In most colorectal cancers, and probably in many other cancer types, a chromosomal instability (CIN) leading to an abnormal chromosome number (aneuploidy) is observed. The physiological and molecular bases of this pervasive abnormality are unknown. Here we show that CIN is consistently associated with the loss of function of a mitotic checkpoint. Moreover, in some cancers displaying CIN the loss of this checkpoint was associated with the mutational inactivation of a human homologue of the yeast BUB1 gene; BUB1 controls mitotic checkpoints and chromosome segregation in yeast. The normal mitotic checkpoints of cells displaying microsatellite instability become defective upon transfer of mutant hBUB1 alleles from either of two CIN cancers.
Antisera to human syncytiotrophoblast microvillous cell surface membranes from different placentas are cytotoxic for lymphocytes from some people but not others, demonstrating the presence of allotypic trophoblast-lymphocyte cross-reactive (TLX) antigens. Exploratory principal components factor analysis, performed on limited data consisting of 300 cytotoxic reactions produced by ten separate trophoblast antisera on a panel of lymphocytes from 30 random donors, suggested the presence of three distinct TLX antigen groupings. It is proposed that such TLX alloantigens are central in establishing maternal recognition and protection of the blastocyst, and that lack of recognition results in implantation failure and spontaneous abortion. These findings are compatible with contemporary results of immunotherapy to prevent recurrent spontaneous abortions, and their implications extend to other conditions of allogeneic coexistence, such as organ transplantation and the tumor-host relationship.
One of the most provocative findings in tumour biology is the relationship between chromosomal changes and embryonal cancers in children. For example, children with the rare paediatric syndrome AGR triad (aniridia, genito-urinary abnormalities and mental retardation) often develop Wilms' tumours at a very early age and carry a germ-line deletion on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p13). It has been suggested that the germ-line deletion 11p is the first of two or more steps to cancer in AGR children. If this were true, one might expect a similar deletion to arise somatically in the far more common isolated Wilms' tumours of children without AGR, as suggested by Knudson from epidemiological data. However, a chromosomal deletion on 11p was observed in only two of five such cases, while it was absent or seen inconsistently in others. We have now used a molecular genetic approach to determine whether Wilms' tumour cells possess somatic alterations at 11p loci. We have found somatic deletions of specific genes in four of six Wilms' tumours. Surprisingly, in all four cases, the deletions were associated with duplications leading to homozygosity of the non-deleted alleles in the tumour cells. As analogous observations were recently reported in retinoblastoma, the genetic events reported here may underlie the development of many such embryonal tumours in children.
A deposit of fossil seabirds from the late Pliocene of Florida includes more than 130 skeletons of an extinct cormorant that is related phylogenetically to Recent species currently restricted to the eastern north Pacific. Evidence suggests the birds died in a single catastrophic event, perhaps a red tide. The fossil cormorant, along with other extinct seabirds and marine mammals, supports molluscan evidence for cold-water upwelling along the Florida Gulf Coast during the Pliocene. A decline in species richness of marine vertebrates throughout the Pliocene of Florida coincides with cessation of upwelling after emergences of the Panamanian Land Bridge.
Venom composition within snake species can show considerable geographical variation, an important consideration because bites by conspecific populations may differ in symptomatology and require different treatments. The underlying causes of this phenomenon have never been explained. Here we present evidence that the variation in the venom of the pitviper Calloselasma rhodostoma (Serpentes: Viperidae) is closely associated with its diet. We also evaluated other possible causes of geographic variation in venom using partial Mantel tests and independent contrasts, but rejected both contemporary gene flow (estimated from geographical proximity) and the phylogenetic relationships (assessed by analysis of mitochondrial DNA) among populations as important influences upon venom evolution. As the primary function of viperid venom is to immobilize and digest prey and prey animals vary in their susceptibility to venom, we suggest that geographical variation in venom composition reflects natural selection for feeding on local prey.
Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanding polyglutamine repeat in the IT15 or huntingtin gene. Although this gene is widely expressed and is required for normal development, the pathology of HD is restricted to the brain, for reasons that remain poorly understood. The huntingtin gene product is expressed at similar levels in patients and controls, and the genetics of the disorder suggest that the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat induces a toxic gain of function, perhaps through interactions with other cellular proteins. Here we report the identification of a protein (huntingtin-associated protein (HAP)-1) that binds to huntingtin. This binding is enhanced by an expanded polyglutamine repeat, the length of which is also known to correlate with the age of disease onset. The HAP-1 protein is enriched in the brain, suggesting a possible basis for the selective brain pathology of HD.
Homoeo-box genes play a central role in the regulation of embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Their widespread phylogenetic distribution, and the tissue and stage specificity of their expression in other organisms, argue that they play a general and significant role in animal development. In D. melanogaster, all homoeo-box genes characterized to date are involved in major aspects of embryogenesis. We report here the molecular characterization of a Drosophila homoeo-box gene that has no apparent involvement in early embryogenesis. The gene appears to be rough, a gene implicated in pattern formation in the developing eye. It is expressed in cells within, and posterior to, the morphogenetic furrow, the site of the primary pattern forming events in the developing retina, and also in a region of the brain of the third instar larva. We have found no genetic or molecular evidence of a role for this gene in other aspects of fly development.
Two maternally derived chromosome sets and both maternal histocompatibility antigen haplotypes were identified in the tissues of a malformed triploid acardiac twin that developed within the same chorion as its normal twin. These findings indicate that the twins arose as a result of independent fertilizations, by two different spermatozoa, of a normal haploid ovum and its diploid first-meiotic-division polar body.
A diploid organism has two copies of each gene, one inherited from each parent. The expression of two inherited alleles is sometimes biased by the effects known as dominant/recessive relationships, which determine the final phenotype of the organism. To explore the mechanisms underlying these relationships, we have examined the monoallelic expression of S-locus protein 11 genes (SP11), which encode the male determinants of self-incompatibility in Brassica. We previously reported that SP11 expression was monoallelic in some S heterozygotes, and that the promoter regions of recessive SP11 alleles were specifically methylated in the anther tapetum. Here we show that this methylation is controlled by trans-acting small non-coding RNA (sRNA). We identified inverted genomic sequences that were similar to the recessive SP11 promoters in the flanking regions of dominant SP11 alleles. These sequences were specifically expressed in the anther tapetum and processed into 24-nucleotide sRNA, named SP11 methylation inducer (Smi). Introduction of the Smi genomic region into the recessive S homozygotes triggered the methylation of the promoter of recessive SP11 alleles and repressed their transcription. This is an example showing sRNA encoded in the flanking region of a dominant allele acts in trans to induce transcriptional silencing of the recessive allele. Our finding may provide new insights into the widespread monoallelic gene expression systems.
A stretch of 200 kilobases (kb) of DNA from the I region of the mouse major histocompatibility complex has been cloned and characterized. It contains the genes for the biochemically defined class II proteins E alpha, E beta and A beta. DNA blot analyses suggest that the I region may contain only 6-8 class II genes. Correlation of our molecular map with the genetic map of the I region confines two of the five I subregions, I-J and I-B, to less than 3.4 kb of DNA at the 3' end of the E beta gene where a hotspot for recombination has been observed. Indeed, the I-A and I-E subregions may be contiguous. If so, the I-B and I-J subregions are not encoded in the I region between the I-A and I-E subregions.
The underlying causes of obesity are poorly understood but probably involve complex interactions between many neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems involved in the regulation of food intake and energy balance. Three pieces of evidence indicate that the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an important component of this system. First, MCH stimulates feeding when injected directly into rat brains; second, the messenger RNA for the MCH precursor is upregulated in the hypothalamus of genetically obese mice and in fasted animals; and third, mice lacking MCH eat less and are lean. MCH antagonists might, therefore, provide a treatment for obesity. However, the development of such molecules has been hampered because the identity of the MCH receptor has been unknown until now. Here we show that the 353-amino-acid human orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SLC-1 expressed in HEK293 cells binds MCH with sub-nanomolar affinity, and is stimulated by MCH to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and reduce forskolin-elevated cyclic AMP levels. We also show that SLC-1 messenger RNA and protein is expressed in the ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, consistent with a role for SLC-1 in mediating the effects of MCH on feeding.
A transferred DNA (T-DNA) tagging vector with the potential to produce dominant mutations was used with cocultured Agrobacterium tumefaciens and protoplasts to tag genes involved in the action of the plant growth substance auxin. Transgenic calli were selected for their ability to grow in the absence of auxin in the culture media. From one experiment, 12 calli that displayed this phenotype were recovered, of which 11 were able to regenerate into plants. In one plant studied in detail, protoplast division in the absence of auxin genetically cosegregated with a single T-DNA insert. A messenger RNA encoded by a 6.4-kilobase sequence of plant genomic DNA rescued from the mutant is overexpressed relative to untransformed plants. The genomic DNA, as well as a cognate complementary DNA, once transfected into protoplasts promote growth and cell division in vitro in the absence of exogenously added auxin.
A set of restriction fragments cloned into phage lambda vectors has allowed us to locate a site necessary for full rpoBC expression. We find that these genes for the two large subunits of RNA polymerase and the genes, rplL and rplJ, for two ribosomal proteins, form a single operon.
Phylogenetic hypotheses provide a context for examining the evolution of heterotrophic lifestyles. The lichen lifestyle, which is the symbiotic association of fungi with algae, is found in various representatives of Dicaryomycotina, both Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. A highly resolved parsimony analysis of small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) sequences suggests at least five independent origins of the lichen habit in disparate groups of Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. Because lichen associations arose from parasitic, mycorrhizal, or free-living saprobic fungi, neither mutualism nor parasitism should be construed as endpoints in symbiont evolution.
Age-associated increases in collagen cross-linking and accumulation of advanced glycosylation products are both accelerated by diabetes, suggesting that glucose-derived cross-link formation may contribute to the development of chronic diabetic complications as well as certain physical changes of aging. Aminoguanidine, a nucleophilic hydrazine compound, prevented both the formation of fluorescent advanced nonenzymatic glycosylation products and the formation of glucose-derived collagen cross-links in vitro. Aminoguanidine administration to rats was equally effective in preventing diabetes-induced formation of fluorescent advanced nonenzymatic glycosylation products and cross-linking of arterial wall connective tissue protein in vivo. The identification of aminoguanidine as an inhibitor of advanced nonenzymatic glycosylation product formation now makes possible precise experimental definition of the pathogenetic significance of this process and suggests a potential clinical role for aminoguanidine in the future treatment of chronic diabetic complications.
It has been suggested that the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and the simian immunodeficiency virus from rhesus macaques (SIVmac) evolved from the sooty mangabey virus SIVsm (ref. 1). We now describe an HIV-2-related isolate, HIV-2-D205, from a healthy Ghanaian woman that is genetically equidistant to the prototypic HIV-2 strains and to SIVsm and SIVmac. Supported by the observation that HIV-2D205 differs in a step of envelope glycoprotein processing, our data indicate that it could represent an alternative HIV-2 subtype and that viruses of the HIV-2/SIVsm/SIVmac group could have already infected humans before HIV-2 and SIVsm/SIVmac diverged.
New methods were used to identify the abnormality in a patient who showed evidence of neuromuscular dysfunction on extensive clinical examination. The methods revealed that the lactate content of the patient's skeletal muscle does not decline normally after exercise and that his red cells are defective in lactate transport. These results suggest that skeletal muscle and erythrocyte membranes share the same genetic lactate transporter (or a common subunit), which is deficient in this patient. This defect may be a common cause of elevated serum creatine kinase levels, as seen in the patient described here and of unexplained episodes of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria.
Emotion is normally regulated in the human brain by a complex circuit consisting of the orbital frontal cortex, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and several other interconnected regions. There are both genetic and environmental contributions to the structure and function of this circuitry. We posit that impulsive aggression and violence arise as a consequence of faulty emotion regulation. Indeed, the prefrontal cortex receives a major serotonergic projection, which is dysfunctional in individuals who show impulsive violence. Individuals vulnerable to faulty regulation of negative emotion are at risk for violence and aggression. Research on the neural circuitry of emotion regulation suggests new avenues of intervention for such at-risk populations.
Autophagy, the process by which cells recycle cytoplasm and dispose of excess or defective organelles, has entered the research spotlight largely owing to the discovery of the protein components that drive this process. Identifying the autophagy genes in yeast and finding orthologs in other organisms reveals the conservation of the mechanism of autophagy in eukaryotes and allows the use of molecular genetics and biology in different model systems to study this process. By mostly morphological studies, autophagy has been linked to disease processes. Whether autophagy protects from or causes disease is unclear. Here, we summarize current knowledge about the role of autophagy in disease and health.
Layered on top of information conveyed by DNA sequence and chromatin are higher order structures that encompass portions of chromosomes, entire chromosomes, and even whole genomes. Interphase chromosomes are not positioned randomly within the nucleus, but instead adopt preferred conformations. Disparate DNA elements co-localize into functionally defined aggregates or 'factories' for transcription and DNA replication. In budding yeast, Drosophila and many other eukaryotes, chromosomes adopt a Rabl configuration, with arms extending from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that abut the nuclear envelope. Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed a method to globally capture intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where chromosomal breakpoints occur. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the yeast genome. Our findings provide a glimpse of the interface between the form and function of a eukaryotic genome.
Many organs are composed of tubular networks that arise by branching morphogenesis in which cells bud from an epithelium and organize into a tube. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and other signalling molecules have been shown to guide branch budding and outgrowth, but it is not known how epithelial cells coordinate their movements and morphogenesis. Here we use genetic mosaic analysis in Drosophila melanogaster to show that there are two functionally distinct classes of cells in budding tracheal branches: cells at the tip that respond directly to Branchless FGF and lead branch outgrowth, and trailing cells that receive a secondary signal to follow the lead cells and form a tube. These roles are not pre-specified; rather, there is competition between cells such that those with the highest FGF receptor activity take the lead positions, whereas those with less FGF receptor activity assume subsidiary positions and form the branch stalk. Competition appears to involve Notch-mediated lateral inhibition that prevents extra cells from assuming the lead. There may also be cooperation between budding cells, because in a mosaic epithelium, cells that cannot respond to the chemoattractant, or respond only poorly, allow other cells in the epithelium to move ahead of them.
Leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae and affects about 700,000 individuals each year. It has long been thought that leprosy has a strong genetic component, and recently we mapped a leprosy susceptibility locus to chromosome 6 region q25-q26 (ref. 3). Here we investigate this region further by using a systematic association scan of the chromosomal interval most likely to harbour this leprosy susceptibility locus. In 197 Vietnamese families we found a significant association between leprosy and 17 markers located in a block of approx. 80 kilobases overlapping the 5' regulatory region shared by the Parkinson's disease gene PARK2 and the co-regulated gene PACRG. Possession of as few as two of the 17 risk alleles was highly predictive of leprosy. This was confirmed in a sample of 975 unrelated leprosy cases and controls from Brazil in whom the same alleles were strongly associated with leprosy. Variants in the regulatory region shared by PARK2 and PACRG therefore act as common risk factors for leprosy.
Slow- and fast-migrating electrophoretic variants of human erythrocyte catalase were encountered in four of approximately 200 families. Tests for nine genetic polymorphisms provided evidence suggesting linkage only in the case of the haptoglobin system.
Quantitative genetic research has built a strong case for the importance of genetic factors in many complex behavioral disorders and dimensions in the domains of psychopathology, personality, and cognitive abilities. Quantitative genetics can also provide an empirical guide and a conceptual framework for the application of molecular genetics. The success of molecular genetics in elucidating the genetic basis of behavioral disorders has largely relied on a reductionistic one gene, one disorder (OGOD) approach in which a single gene is necessary and sufficient to develop a disorder. In contrast, a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach involves the search for multiple genes, each of which is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of a trait. The OGOD and QTL approaches have both advantages and disadvantages for identifying genes that affect complex human behaviors.
Current therapies for most human genetic diseases are inadequate. In response to the need for effective treatments, modern molecular genetics is providing tools for an unprecedented new approach to disease treatment through an attack directly on mutant genes. Recent results with several target organs and gene transfer techniques have led to broad medical and scientific acceptance of the feasibility of this "gene therapy" concept for disorders of the bone marrow, liver, and central nervous system; some kinds of cancer; and deficiencies of circulating enzymes, hormones, and coagulation factors. The most well-developed models involve alteration of mutant target genes by gene transfer with recombinant pathogenic viruses in order to express new genetic information and to correct disease phenotypes--the conversion of the swords of pathology into the plowshares of therapy.
Acute electrophysiological effects of ethanol were studied in two lines of mice that differ markedly in their response to the soporific effects of systemic alcohol administration. Cerebellar Purkinje neurons from the genetic line that had long sleep times were one to two orders of magnitude more sensitive to the depressant effects of locally administered ethanol than those from the line that had short sleep times. The data suggest that there are genetically determined specificities in the acute effects of ethanol on central neurons and that such specificities might be used to determine which regions of the cerebellum participate in differences in behavioral responses to this substance.
The gene tailless is a member of the superfamily of genes that encode transcription factors of the ligand-activated nuclear receptor type, and is expressed in the invertebrate and vertebrate brain. In mice, its transcripts are restricted to the periventricular zone of the forebrain, the site of origin of neurons and glia. Here we use homologous recombination to generate mice that lack a functional tailless protein. Homozygous mutant mice are viable at birth, indicating that tailless is not required for prenatal survival; however, adult mutant mice show a reduction in the size of rhinencephalic and limbic structures, including the olfactory, infrarhinal and entorhinal cortex, amygdala and dentate gyrus. Both male and female mice are more aggressive than usual and females lack normal maternal instincts. These animals therefore enable a molecular approach to be taken towards understanding the genetic architecture and morphogenesis of the forebrain.
Distribution of amino acids in 68 representative proteins is compared with their distribution among 61 codons of the genetic code. Average amounts of lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and alanine are above the levels anticipated from the genetic code, and arginine, serine, leucine, cysteine, proline, and histidine are below such levels. Arginine plus lysine account for 11.0 percent of codons and aspartic acid plus glutamic acid account for 11.3 percent; thus the average charge is roughly neutral.
The close correspondence often observed between the taxonomy of parasites and their hosts has led to Fahrenholz's rule, which postulates that parasites and their hosts speciate in synchrony. This leads to the prediction that phylogenetic trees of parasites and their hosts should be topologically identical. We report here a test of this prediction which involves the construction of phylogenetic trees for rodents and their ectoparasites using protein electrophoretic data. We find a high degree of concordance in the branching patterns of the trees which suggests that there is a history of cospeciation in this host-parasite assemblage. In several cases where the branching patterns were identical in the host and parasite phylogenies, the branch lengths were also very similar which, given the assumptions of molecular clock theory, strongly suggests that the speciation of these hosts and ectoparasites was roughly contemporaneous and causally related.
"Twitcher' is a recently recognized mouse mutant which, on the basis of morphological and enzymatic criteria, represents a murine model for globoid-cell leukodystrophy in man. In the twitcher mouse, myelin sheaths develop normally in peripheral nerves until about the fifteenth day when the rate of myelination declines, demyelination begins and Krabbe-type inclusions are seen in macrophages and Schwann cells. With age, demyelination becomes extensive, affecting fibres of all sizes. The axons are relatively spared, although they are smaller than normal. Twitcher peripheral nerves transplanted into normal hosts show, after 2 months, all the characteristics associated with globoid-cell leukodystrophy. After longer periods of time, however, pathological changes within the grafts appear considerably improved with only occasional evidence of myelin loss, little endoneurial oedema and few globoid cells. Migration of host Schwann cells into the graft can be excluded as a possible explanation. In the experiments reported here, we have attempted to determine whether the morphological improvement of grafted twitcher nerves is accompanied by an increase in activity of the enzyme galactosylceramidase. Our results show that galactosylceramidase activity in twitcher sciatic nerves grafted into normal hosts is variable after 1-2 months but indistinguishable from those in the host nerves and much higher than those in intact twitcher nerves after 4.5-9 months. In addition to migration of host Schwann cells, other tissues originating from the host can be excluded as cause of the high enzyme activity. This is the first evidence of long-term in vivo enzyme replacement, accompanied by improved pathology, in a genetic sphingolipidosis.
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of retinal degeneration characterized by progressive visual field loss, night blindness and pigmentary retinopathy. Its prevalence is in the region of 1-2 in 5,000 of the general population, making it one of the commoner causes of blindness in early and middle life. Although 36-48% of RP patients are isolated cases, the remainder show autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked modes of inheritance. The X-linked variety ( XLRP ) is found in 14-22% of RP families in the UK. In the present study, X chromosome-specific recombinant DNA probes which can detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms have been used to localize the XLRP gene(s) to a subregion of the X chromosome using linkage analysis. One of the probes, L1.28, has been shown to be closely linked to XLRP in five kindreds, with 95% confidence limits of 0-15 centimorgans (maximum LOD score of 7.89 at a distance of 3 centimorgans). This suggests that the XLRP locus lies on the proximal part of the short arm of the X chromosome. This probe is potentially useful for carrier detection and early diagnosis in about 40% of cases, provided that genetic heterogeneity can be excluded by analysis of further families.
The human B cell-specific alloantigen which is closely linked genetically to HLA contains two non-covalently associated, sialogycoprotein subunits of molecular weight (MW) 29,000 (p29), and 34,000 (p34). Although p29 and p34 have different amino-terminal sequences, their tyrosine peptide maps indicate considerable similarity in other portions of their polypeptide chains. Thus the genes for their proteins may have evolved by duplication of a common ancestral gene. Another lymphocyte cell surface protein of MW 16,000 (p16) has also been characterised. Both p16 and p44 (the heavy chain of HLA-A,B antigens) have been compared with p29 and p34.
Double fertilization and the associated formation of endosperm have long been considered unique and defining characters (autapomorphies) of the angiosperms. During normal fertilization in Ephedra nevadensis, a nonflowering seed plant, fusion of a second sperm nucleus with the ventral canal nucleus occurs regularly within the egg cytoplasm. The occurrence of double fertilization in Ephedra assumes added significance in light of its critical phylogenetic position as a basal member of the most closely related extant group of seed plants (Gnetales) to angiosperms. Thus, double fertilization in angiosperms and Ephedra may represent an evolutionary homology.
Controlling the complex spatio-temporal dynamics underlying life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as fibrillation is extremely difficult, because of the nonlinear interaction of excitation waves in a heterogeneous anatomical substrate. In the absence of a better strategy, strong, globally resetting electrical shocks remain the only reliable treatment for cardiac fibrillation. Here we establish the relationship between the response of the tissue to an electric field and the spatial distribution of heterogeneities in the scale-free coronary vascular structure. We show that in response to a pulsed electric field, E, these heterogeneities serve as nucleation sites for the generation of intramural electrical waves with a source density r(E) and a characteristic time, t, for tissue depolarization that obeys the power law t [?] E(a). These intramural wave sources permit targeting of electrical turbulence near the cores of the vortices of electrical activity that drive complex fibrillatory dynamics. We show in vitro that simultaneous and direct access to multiple vortex cores results in rapid synchronization of cardiac tissue and therefore, efficient termination of fibrillation. Using this control strategy, we demonstrate low-energy termination of fibrillation in vivo. Our results give new insights into the mechanisms and dynamics underlying the control of spatio-temporal chaos in heterogeneous excitable media and provide new research perspectives towards alternative, life-saving low-energy defibrillation techniques.
By modifying habitats and creating bridges and barriers between landmasses, climate change and tectonic events are believed to have important consequences for diversification of terrestrial organisms. Such consequences should be most evident in phylogenetic histories of groups that are ancient, widespread, and diverse. The squirrel family (Sciuridae) is one of very few mammalian families endemic to Eurasia, Africa, and North and South America and is ideal for examining these issues. Through phylogenetic and molecular-clock analyses, we infer that arrival and diversification of squirrels in Africa, on Sunda Shelf islands, across Beringea, and across the Panamanian isthmus coincide in timing and location with multiple well-documented sea-level, tectonic, and paleontological events. These precise correspondences point to an important role for global change in the diversification of a major group of mammals.
The early genetic pathway(s) triggering the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) remain largely unknown. Here, we describe an autosomal dominant form of CAD/MI (adCAD1) that is caused by the deletion of seven amino acids in transcription factor MEF2A. The deletion disrupts nuclear localization of MEF2A, reduces MEF2A-mediated transcription activation, and abolishes synergistic activation by MEF2A and by the transcription factor GATA-1 through a dominant-negative mechanism. The MEF2A protein demonstrates strong expression in the endothelium of coronary arteries. These results identify a pathogenic gene for a familial vascular disease with features of CAD and implicate the MEF2A signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of CAD/MI.
A single, high linear energy transfer alpha particle can kill a target cell. We have developed methods to target molecular-sized generators of alpha-emitting isotope cascades to the inside of cancer cells using actinium-225 coupled to internalizing monoclonal antibodies. In vitro, these constructs specifically killed leukemia, lymphoma, breast, ovarian, neuroblastoma, and prostate cancer cells at becquerel (picocurie) levels. Injection of single doses of the constructs at kilobecquerel (nanocurie) levels into mice bearing solid prostate carcinoma or disseminated human lymphoma induced tumor regression and prolonged survival, without toxicity, in a substantial fraction of animals. Nanogenerators targeting a wide variety of cancers may be possible.
The control of the broadband frequency comb emitted from a mode-locked femtosecond laser has permitted a wide range of scientific and technological advances--ranging from the counting of optical cycles for next-generation atomic clocks to measurements of phase-sensitive high-field processes. A unique advantage of the stabilized frequency comb is that it provides, in a single laser beam, about a million optical modes with very narrow linewidths and absolute frequency positions known to better than one part in 10(15) (ref. 5). One important application of this vast array of highly coherent optical fields is precision spectroscopy, in which a large number of modes can be used to map internal atomic energy structure and dynamics. However, an efficient means of simultaneously identifying, addressing and measuring the amplitude or relative phase of individual modes has not existed. Here we use a high-resolution disperser to separate the individual modes of a stabilized frequency comb into a two-dimensional array in the image plane of the spectrometer. We illustrate the power of this technique for high-resolution spectral fingerprinting of molecular iodine vapour, acquiring in a few milliseconds absorption images covering over 6 THz of bandwidth with high frequency resolution. Our technique for direct and parallel accessing of stabilized frequency comb modes could find application in high-bandwidth spread-spectrum communications with increased security, high-resolution coherent quantum control, and arbitrary optical waveform synthesis with control at the optical radian level.
Females in almost all animal groups copulate with multiple males. This behaviour allows different males to compete for fertilization and gives females the opportunity to mediate this competition. In many animals and most insects, the second male to copulate with a female typically sires most of her offspring. In Drosophila melanogaster, this second-male sperm precedence has long been studied but, as in most species, its mechanism has remained unknown. Here we show, using labelled sperm in doubly mated females, that males can both physically displace and incapacitate stored sperm from earlier-mating males. Displacement occurs only if the second male transfers sperm to the female, and in only one of her three sperm-storage organs. Incapacitation can be caused by either fertile or spermless second males, but requires extended intervals between matings. Sperm from different males are not 'stratified' in the storage organs but mix freely. Many animal species may have multiple mechanisms of sperm competition like those observed here, and revealing these mechanisms is necessary to understand the genetic and evolutionary basis of second-male sperm precedence in animals.
Satellite images have long revealed the surface expression of large amplitude internal waves that propagate along density interfaces beneath the sea surface. Internal waves are typically the most energetic high-frequency events in the coastal ocean, displacing water parcels by up to 100 m and generating strong currents and turbulence that mix nutrients into near-surface waters for biological utilization. While internal waves are known to be generated by tidal currents over ocean-bottom topography, they have also been observed frequently in the absence of any apparent tide-topography interactions. Here we present repeated measurements of velocity, density and acoustic backscatter across the Columbia River plume front. These show how internal waves can be generated from a river plume that flows as a gravity current into the coastal ocean. We find that the convergence of horizontal velocities at the plume front causes frontal growth and subsequent displacement downward of near-surface waters. Individual freely propagating waves are released from the river plume front when the front's propagation speed decreases below the wave speed in the water ahead of it. This mechanism generates internal waves of similar amplitude and steepness as internal waves from tide-topography interactions observed elsewhere, and is therefore important to the understanding of coastal ocean mixing.
Two secreted proteins, Wingless and Hedgehog, instruct cell fates within the segmented epidermis of Drosophila embryos (reviewed in ref. 5). Wingless (Wg) is expressed by the most posterior cells in each parasegment; Hedgehog (Hh) is expressed in the most anterior cells of the next parasegment. Immediately after gastrulation, the two cell types are mutually dependent. Local Wg signalling stabilizes Hh expression and local Hh signalling stabilizes Wg expression. Direct Wg autoregulation (autocrine signalling) is masked by its paracrine role in maintaining hh, which in turn maintains wg. I have used zeste-white3 (zw3) and patched (ptc) mutant backgrounds to uncouple genetically this positive-feedback loop and to study autocrine Wg signalling. I report here that direct Wg autoregulation differs from Wg signalling to adjacent cells in the importance of fused (fu), smoothened (smo) and cubitus interruptus (ci) relative to zw3 and armadillo (arm). I also find that Wg autoregulation during this early hh-dependent phase differs from later Wg autoregulation by lack of gooseberry (gsb) participation.
Salmonella infection continues to be a major world-wide health problem. One essential pathogenic feature common to all Salmonella is their ability to penetrate the cells of the intestinal epithelium which are normally non-phagocytic. The internalization of Salmonella into mammalian cells is thought to be a receptor-mediated phenomenon and the invasion of cultured epithelial cells depends on several Salmonella genes, but nothing is known about the host determinants participating in this interaction. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation follows stimulation of many cell-surface receptors to initiate signal transduction pathways that stimulate cellular responses. We report here that invasion of cultured Henle-407 cells by Salmonella typhimurium induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. In contrast, an isogenic strain of S. typhimurium that is defective in invasion owing to a mutation in the invA gene is unable to induce such phosphorylation. Addition of EGF to cultured Henle-407 cells allowed the internalization of the invasion-defective S. typhimurium invA mutant although it did not cause the internalization of an adherent, but non-invasive, strain of Escherichia coli. This result indicates that stimulation of the EGF receptor is involved in the invasion of cultured Henle-407 cells by S. typhimurium.
The fundamental mechanism behind laser action leads in general only to narrowband, single-wavelength emission. Several approaches for achieving spectrally broadband laser action have been put forward, such as enhancing the optical feedback in the wings of the gain spectrum, multi-peaked gain spectra, and the most favoured technique at present, ultrashort pulse excitation. Each of these approaches has drawbacks, such as a complex external laser cavity configuration, a non-flat optical gain envelope function, or an inability to operate in continuous mode, respectively. Here we present a monolithic, mid-infrared 'supercontinuum' semiconductor laser that has none of these drawbacks. We adopt a quantum cascade configuration, where a number of dissimilar intersubband optical transitions are made to cooperate in order to provide broadband optical gain from 5 to 8 microm wavelength. Laser action with a Fabry-Perot spectrum covering all wavelengths from 6 to 8 microm simultaneously is demonstrated with this approach. Lasers that emit light over such an extremely wide wavelength range are of interest for applications as varied as terabit optical data communications or ultra-precision metrology and spectroscopy.
The fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has been used extensively for genetic studies but until now it has not been utilized as a host organism for DNA cloning. Here we describe a method for high-frequency transformation fo a leu 1(-) strain of this yeast with hybrid plasmids containing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae LEu 2(+) gene, a bacterial plasmid and either the S. cerevisiae 2 mm plasmid or autonomously replicating sequences (ars)(1) derived from S. pombe DNA. Some of the plasmids contain unique restriction sites which make them suitable for the isolation of S. pombe genes, and they can also be used for the exchange of DNA between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae.
Some stimulatory receptors of the innate immune system, such as the NKG2D receptor (also called KLRK1) expressed by natural killer cells and activated CD8(+)T cells, recognize self-molecules that are upregulated in diseased cells by poorly understood mechanisms. Here we show that mouse and human NKG2D ligands are upregulated in non-tumour cell lines by genotoxic stress and stalled DNA replication, conditions known to activate a major DNA damage checkpoint pathway initiated by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia, mutated) or ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) protein kinases. Ligand upregulation was prevented by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ATR, ATM or Chk1 (a downstream transducer kinase in the pathway). Furthermore, constitutive ligand expression by a tumour cell line was inhibited by targeting short interfering RNA to ATM, suggesting that ligand expression in established tumour cells, which often harbour genomic irregularities, may be due to chronic activation of the DNA damage response pathway. Thus, the DNA damage response, previously shown to arrest the cell cycle and enhance DNA repair functions, or to trigger apoptosis, may also participate in alerting the immune system to the presence of potentially dangerous cells.
Genomic exclusion is an abnormal form of conjugation occurring between cells with defective micronuclei and normal cells with diploid micronuclei. The progeny are heterocaryons; each cell has an old macronucleus but a new diploid micronucleus derived from one meiotic product of the normal mate. Such cells express genes found in the old macronucleus, are sexually mature, and can be specifically selected. When inbred, they give rise to lines genetically homozygous at all known loci.
Distinct and evolutionarily conserved signal transduction cascades mediate survival or death in response to developmental and environmental cues. The stress-activated protein kinases, or Jun N-terminal kinases (SAPKs/JNKs), are activated in response to a variety of cellular stresses such as changes in osmolarity and metabolism, DNA damage, heat shock, ischaemia, or inflammatory cytokines. Sek1 (JNKK/MKK4) is a direct activator of SAPKs/JNKs in response to environmental stresses or mitogenic factors. Here we investigate the role of Sek1 in development and apoptosis by deleting sek1 in embryonic stem (ES) cells by homologous recombination. We provide genetic evidence that different stresses utilize distinct signalling pathways for SAPK/JNK activation. sek1(-/-) rag2(-/-) chimaeric mice have normal numbers of mature T cells but fewer immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. The sek1 mutation did not affect the induction of apoptosis in response to environmental stresses in ES and T cells: instead, sek1 protected thymocytes from CD95 (Fas)- and CD3-mediated apoptosis. These data indicate that SEK1 mediates survival signals in T-cell development.
Most eukaryotic pre-messenger RNAs are processed at their 3' ends by endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation. In yeast, this processing requires polyadenylate [poly(A)] polymerase (PAP) and other proteins that have not yet been characterized. Here, mutations in the PAP1 gene were shown to be synergistically lethal with previously identified mutations in the RNA14 and RNA15 genes, which suggests that their encoded proteins participate in 3'-end processing. Indeed, extracts from ma14 and rna15 mutants were shown to be deficient in both steps of processing. Biochemical complementation experiments and reconstitution of both activities with partially purified cleavage factor I (CF I) validated the genetic prediction.
When many ligands bind to cell-surface receptors, ligand-receptor complexes are internalized via clathrin coated pits by a process called receptor-mediated endocytosis. The cytoplasmic fate of ligands internalized within endocytic vesicles or endosomes is variable. For example, maternal immunoglobulins are transported through the cytoplasm of neonatal intestinal epithelial cells and are exocytosed at the basolateral surface. However, other ligands are degraded as a result of their delivery to the lysosomal compartment of cells. Although the translocation of endosomes to the Golgi region in the cell centre seems to be a general phenomenon presumably coupled to ligand degradation by lysosomes and endosomes and lysosomes undergo saltatory movements within the cytoplasm, the spatial control of interaction between the two structures is not understood. To address this problem we have begun to examine the spatial and temporal intracellular distribution of endosomes and lysosomes. Utilizing a new fluorescent microscopic approach, we have now been able simultaneously to visualize endosome and lysosome populations in living cells. Our results suggest that a specific relocation of lysosomes is rapidly induced upon binding of different types of ligands to the cell surface; this migration of lysosomes to the Golgi region of the cell precedes the translocation of endosomes into the same area.
To manipulate objects or to use tools we must compensate for any forces arising from interaction with the physical environment. Recent studies indicate that this compensation is achieved by learning an internal model of the dynamics, that is, a neural representation of the relation between motor command and movement. In these studies interaction with the physical environment was stable, but many common tasks are intrinsically unstable. For example, keeping a screwdriver in the slot of a screw is unstable because excessive force parallel to the slot can cause the screwdriver to slip and because misdirected force can cause loss of contact between the screwdriver and the screw. Stability may be dependent on the control of mechanical impedance in the human arm because mechanical impedance can generate forces which resist destabilizing motion. Here we examined arm movements in an unstable dynamic environment created by a robotic interface. Our results show that humans learn to stabilize unstable dynamics using the skillful and energy-efficient strategy of selective control of impedance geometry.
Using long-duration, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we found that the magnetic dipole field generated by a dynamo action in a rotating spherical shell repeatedly reverses its polarity at irregular intervals (that is, punctuated reversal). Although the total convection energy and magnetic energy alternate between a high-energy state and a low-energy state, the dipole polarity can reverse only at high-energy states where the north-south symmetry of the convection pattern is broken and the columnar vortex structure becomes vulnerable. Another attractive finding is that the quadrupole mode grows, exceeding the dipole mode before the reversal; this may help to explain how Earth's magnetic field reverses.
The capacity to evaluate other people is essential for navigating the social world. Humans must be able to assess the actions and intentions of the people around them, and make accurate decisions about who is friend and who is foe, who is an appropriate social partner and who is not. Indeed, all social animals benefit from the capacity to identify individual conspecifics that may help them, and to distinguish these individuals from others that may harm them. Human adults evaluate people rapidly and automatically on the basis of both behaviour and physical features, but the ontogenetic origins and development of this capacity are not well understood. Here we show that 6- and 10-month-old infants take into account an individual's actions towards others in evaluating that individual as appealing or aversive: infants prefer an individual who helps another to one who hinders another, prefer a helping individual to a neutral individual, and prefer a neutral individual to a hindering individual. These findings constitute evidence that preverbal infants assess individuals on the basis of their behaviour towards others. This capacity may serve as the foundation for moral thought and action, and its early developmental emergence supports the view that social evaluation is a biological adaptation.
The recent identification of a gene residing at the mouse limb deformity (ld) locus permits us to test the hypothesis that disruption of this gene is responsible for an inherited anomaly affecting embryonic pattern formation. The gene gives rise to alternatively processed messenger RNAs that can be translated as a family of related protein products, termed the formins. We have now analysed transcripts from this gene in four independently isolated mutant alleles. In two of these, the ldHd allele (created by insertion of a transgene) and the ldIn2 allele (created by a translocation-inversion involving mouse chromosomes 2 and 17), a common subset of ld transcripts is abolished, but others are apparently unaltered. The correlation of altered transcripts in two independent ld mutants strongly supports the notion that one or more altered formins is responsible for the observed phenotype. That the defect is limited to the limb and kidney, despite expression of ld mRNA in other unaffected organs, suggests that these mutant alleles represent only partial loss of ld function.
The canalization concept describes the resistance of a developmental process to phenotypic variation, regardless of genetic and environmental perturbations, owing to the existence of buffering mechanisms. Severe perturbations, which overcome such buffering mechanisms, produce altered phenotypes that can be heritable and can themselves be canalized by a genetic assimilation process. An important implication of this concept is that the buffering mechanism could be genetically controlled. Recent studies on Hsp90, a protein involved in several cellular processes and development pathways, indicate that it is a possible molecular mechanism for canalization and genetic assimilation. In both flies and plants, mutations in the Hsp90-encoding gene induce a wide range of phenotypic abnormalities, which have been interpreted as an increased sensitivity of different developmental pathways to hidden genetic variability. Thus, Hsp90 chaperone machinery may be an evolutionarily conserved buffering mechanism of phenotypic variance, which provides the genetic material for natural selection. Here we offer an additional, perhaps alternative, explanation for proposals of a concrete mechanism underlying canalization. We show that, in Drosophila, functional alterations of Hsp90 affect the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA; a class of germ-line-specific small RNAs) silencing mechanism leading to transposon activation and the induction of morphological mutants. This indicates that Hsp90 mutations can generate new variation by transposon-mediated 'canonical' mutagenesis.
A report of an association of chromosome breakage and birth defects with spray adhesive exposure resulted in a ban on the sale of these products and nationwide publicity warning exposed women. Six months later the ban was removed; the association could not be confirmed. Replies to questionnaires sent to medical genetics centers throughout the United States revealed that more than 1100 inquiries had been received and more than 1200 working days were expended because of the issue. Eleven exposed women underwent diagnostic amniocentesis, and on elected to abort her fetus. Eight other women who were exposed also elected to do so, but without first undergoing diagnostic amniocentesis. The episode illustrates some of the unexpected and unnecessary consequenes that can arise from the false identification of an environmental agent as a mutagen or teratogen.
The gene for the atypical NOTCH ligand delta-like homologue 1 (Dlk1) encodes membrane-bound and secreted isoforms that function in several developmental processes in vitro and in vivo. Dlk1, a member of a cluster of imprinted genes, is expressed from the paternally inherited chromosome. Here we show that mice that are deficient in Dlk1 have defects in postnatal neurogenesis in the subventricular zone: a developmental continuum that results in depletion of mature neurons in the olfactory bulb. We show that DLK1 is secreted by niche astrocytes, whereas its membrane-bound isoform is present in neural stem cells (NSCs) and is required for the inductive effect of secreted DLK1 on self-renewal. Notably, we find that there is a requirement for Dlk1 to be expressed from both maternally and paternally inherited chromosomes. Selective absence of Dlk1 imprinting in both NSCs and niche astrocytes is associated with postnatal acquisition of DNA methylation at the germ-line-derived imprinting control region. The results emphasize molecular relationships between NSCs and the niche astrocyte cells of the microenvironment, identifying a signalling system encoded by a single gene that functions coordinately in both cell types. The modulation of genomic imprinting in a stem-cell environment adds a new level of epigenetic regulation to the establishment and maintenance of the niche, raising wider questions about the adaptability, function and evolution of imprinting in specific developmental contexts.
Pheromone-stimulated haploid yeast cells undergo a differentiation process that allows them to mate. Transmission of the intracellular signal involves threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of the redundant FUS3 and KSS1 kinases, which are members of the MAP kinase family. FUS3/KSS1 phosphorylation depends on two additional kinases, STE11 and STE7 (refs 2, 5, 6). Genetic analyses predict an ordered pathway where STE11 acts before STE7 and FUS3/KSS1 (refs 2, 7). Here we report that STE7 is a dual-specificity kinase that modifies FUS3 at the appropriate sites and stimulates its catalytic activity in vitro. From these data and previous genetic results, we argue that STE7 is the physiological activator of FUS3. Recent indications that MAP kinase activators are related to STE7 suggest that signal transduction pathways in many, if not all, eukaryotic organisms use homologous kinase cascades.
During embryonic development, orderly patterns of gene expression eventually assign each cell in the embryo its particular fate. For the anteroposterior axis of the Drosophila embryo, the first step in this process depends on a spatial gradient of the maternal morphogen Bicoid (Bcd). Positional information of this gradient is transmitted to downstream gap genes, each occupying a well defined spatial domain. We determined the precision of the initial process by comparing expression domains in different embryos. Here we show that the Bcd gradient displays a high embryo-to-embryo variability, but that this noise in the positional information is strongly decreased ('filtered') at the level of hunchback (hb) gene expression. In contrast to the Bcd gradient, the hb expression pattern already includes the information about the scale of the embryo. We show that genes known to interact directly with Hb are not responsible for its spatial precision, but that the maternal gene staufen may be crucial.
Both parental genomes are expressed during embryogenesis, although the time of activation of the paternally inherited genes varies between organisms. Results reported by Vielle-Calzada et al. have suggested that delayed activation of the paternal genome seems to be the rule in plant development. We find, however, that during early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis, paternal genes are expressed and are sufficient for normal development. Our findings indicate that there is no overall maternal control of early embryogenesis, and that the contribution of the parental alleles needs to be assessed for each gene individually.
T cell receptor stimulation without costimulation is insufficient for the induction of an optimal immune response. It is thought that engagement of the CD28 molecule with its ligand B7 provides an essential costimulatory signal without which full activation of T cells cannot occur. A mouse strain with a defective CD28 gene was established. Development of T and B cells in the CD28-deficient mice appeared normal. However, T lymphocytes derived from CD28-/- mutant mice had impaired responses to lectins. Lectin stimulation did not trigger interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, IL-2 receptor alpha expression was significantly decreased, and exogenous IL-2 only partially rescued the CD28 defect. Basal immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations in CD28-deficient mice were about one-fifth of those found in wild-type controls, with low titers of IgG1 and IgG2b but an increase in IgG2a. In addition, activity of T helper cells in CD28-/- mice was reduced and immunoglobulin class switching was diminished after infection with vesicular stomatitis virus. However, cytotoxic T cells could still be induced and the mice showed delayed-type hypersensitivity after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Thus, CD28 is not required for all T cell responses in vivo, suggesting that alternative costimulatory pathways may exist.
The marine dinoflagellates commonly responsible for toxic red tides are parasitized by other dinoflagellate species. Using culture-independent environmental ribosomal RNA sequences and fluorescence markers, we identified host-specific infections among several species. Each parasitoid produces 60 to 400 offspring, leading to extraordinarily rapid control of the host's population. During 3 consecutive years of observation in a natural estuary, all dinoflagellates observed were chronically infected, and a given host species was infected by a single genetically distinct parasite year after year. Our observations in natural ecosystems suggest that although bloom-forming dinoflagellates may escape control by grazing organisms, they eventually succumb to parasite attack.
The elucidation of the human genome sequence has made it possible to identify genetic alterations in cancers in unprecedented detail. To begin a systematic analysis of such alterations, we determined the sequence of well-annotated human protein-coding genes in two common tumor types. Analysis of 13,023 genes in 11 breast and 11 colorectal cancers revealed that individual tumors accumulate an average of approximately 90 mutant genes but that only a subset of these contribute to the neoplastic process. Using stringent criteria to delineate this subset, we identified 189 genes (average of 11 per tumor) that were mutated at significant frequency. The vast majority of these genes were not known to be genetically altered in tumors and are predicted to affect a wide range of cellular functions, including transcription, adhesion, and invasion. These data define the genetic landscape of two human cancer types, provide new targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention, and open fertile avenues for basic research in tumor biology.
Earlier indications that brown fat has a thermogenic role in rats exposed to cold suggested that certain comparable functions in hibernating marmots be investigated. From the results it appears that arousal of the animal by cold is induced by sympathetically activated thermogenesis in areas of brown fat so located, relative to the vasculature, that heat is transferred to the thoracic structures and cervical spinal regions.
Reading disability (dyslexia) is a major social, educational, and mental health problem. Although estimates of prevalence vary, up to 10-15% of school-age children have severe reading deficits in spite of average intelligence and adequate educational opportunity. That reading disability may have a constitutional basis has long been recognized, and results of twin and family studies suggest that one or more of its forms may be heritable; however, definitive evidence for a genetic aetiology has not been reported. Establishing a heritable basis for reading disability could suggest possible causes, give improved risk estimates, facilitate early diagnosis, and provide validity tests for ostensible subtypes. In this report, we apply a recently developed multiple regression analysis to data collected from a sample of 64 pairs of identical twins and 55 pairs of fraternal twins, in which at least one member of the pairs is reading disabled, and present evidence for a significant genetic aetiology.
There is considerable genetic diversity among viruses of different subtypes (designated A to J) in the major group of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the form of HIV that is dominant in the global epidemic. If available, HIV-1 sequences pre-dating the recognition of AIDS could be crucial in defining the time of origin and the subsequent evolution of these viruses in humans. The oldest known case of HIV-1 infection was reported to be that of a sailor from Manchester who died of an AIDS-like illness in 1959; however, the authenticity of this case has not been confirmed. Genetic analysis of sequences from clinical materials obtained from 1971 to 1976 from members of a Norwegian family infected earlier than 1971 showed that they carried viruses of the HIV-1 outlier group, a variant form that is mainly restricted to West Africa. Here we report the amplification and characterization of viral sequences from a 1959 African plasma sample that was previously found to be HIV-1 seropositive. Multiple phylogenetic analyses not only authenticate this case as the oldest known HIV-1 infection, but also place its viral sequence near the ancestral node of subtypes B and D in the major group, indicating that these HIV-1 subtypes, and perhaps all major-group viruses, may have evolved from a single introduction into the African population not long before 1959.
External climate forcings-such as long-term changes in solar insolation-generate different climate responses in tropical and high latitude regions. Documenting the spatial and temporal variability of past climates is therefore critical for understanding how such forcings are translated into regional climate variability. In contrast to the data-rich middle and high latitudes, high-quality climate-proxy records from equatorial regions are relatively few, especially from regions experiencing the bimodal seasonal rainfall distribution associated with twice-annual passage of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Here we present a continuous and well-resolved climate-proxy record of hydrological variability during the past 25,000 years from equatorial East Africa. Our results, based on complementary evidence from seismic-reflection stratigraphy and organic biomarker molecules in the sediment record of Lake Challa near Mount Kilimanjaro, reveal that monsoon rainfall in this region varied at half-precessional ( approximately 11,500-year) intervals in phase with orbitally controlled insolation forcing. The southeasterly and northeasterly monsoons that advect moisture from the western Indian Ocean were strengthened in alternation when the inter-hemispheric insolation gradient was at a maximum; dry conditions prevailed when neither monsoon was intensified and modest local March or September insolation weakened the rain season that followed. On sub-millennial timescales, the temporal pattern of hydrological change on the East African Equator bears clear high-northern-latitude signatures, but on the orbital timescale it mainly responded to low-latitude insolation forcing. Predominance of low-latitude climate processes in this monsoon region can be attributed to the low-latitude position of its continental regions of surface air flow convergence, and its relative isolation from the Atlantic Ocean, where prominent meridional overturning circulation more tightly couples low-latitude climate regimes to high-latitude boundary conditions.
Circadian rhythms of mammals are timed by an endogenous clock with a period of about 24 hours located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Light synchronizes this clock to the external environment by daily adjustments in the phase of the circadian oscillation. The mechanism has been thought to involve the release of excitatory amino acids from retinal afferents to the SCN. Brief treatment of rat SCN in vitro with glutamate (Glu), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), or nitric oxide (NO) generators produced lightlike phase shifts of circadian rhythms. The SCN exhibited calcium-dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Antagonists of NMDA or NOS pathways blocked Glu effects in vitro, and intracerebroventricular injection of a NOS inhibitor in vivo blocked the light-induced resetting of behavioral rhythms. Together, these data indicate that Glu release, NMDA receptor activation, NOS stimulation, and NO production link light activation of the retina to cellular changes within the SCN mediating the phase resetting of the biological clock.
A major role of the classical transplantation antigens (designated class I antigens) is the presentation of virus-infected cells to cytotoxic T cells, a process that leads to the destruction of the cell displaying the viral antigen. Consistent with this function is the finding that these transplantation antigens (encoded by the H-2K, H-2D and H-2L genes in mice) are cell-surface glycoproteins with their amino-termini protruding extracellularly and their carboxy-termini located inside the cell. While the external domain is expected to provide biological specificity required for the associative presentation of viral antigens, the role of the cytoplasmic domain remains obscure. The recent observation that this latter region of the molecule is encoded by three separate DNA exons has suggested a complex role for this portion of the polypeptide chain. We have now obtained evidence for the use of alternative acceptor splice sites in the H-2K gene, resulting in two RNA transcripts that would encode H-2K antigens differing in their carboxy-termini. This is the first demonstration of the use of alternative splice acceptor sites in the same class I gene, and indicates the existence of different functional subsets of antigens encoded by the same gene.
RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that is well defined genetically in Caenorhabditis elegans. RNAi has been postulated to function as an adaptive antiviral immune mechanism in the worm, but there is no experimental evidence for this. Part of the limitation is that there are no known natural viral pathogens of C. elegans. Here we describe an infection model in C. elegans using the mammalian pathogen vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to study the role of RNAi in antiviral immunity. VSV infection is potentiated in cells derived from RNAi-defective worm mutants (rde-1; rde-4), leading to the production of infectious progeny virus, and is inhibited in mutants with an enhanced RNAi response (rrf-3; eri-1). Because the RNAi response occurs in the absence of exogenously added VSV small interfering RNAs, these results show that RNAi is activated during VSV infection and that RNAi is a genuine antiviral immune defence mechanism in the worm.
Homo neanderthalensis has a unique combination of craniofacial features that are distinct from fossil and extant 'anatomically modern' Homo sapiens (modern humans). Morphological evidence, direct isotopic dates and fossil mitochondrial DNA from three Neanderthals indicate that the Neanderthals were a separate evolutionary lineage for at least 500,000 yr. However, it is unknown when and how Neanderthal craniofacial autapomorphies (unique, derived characters) emerged during ontogeny. Here we use computerized fossil reconstruction and geometric morphometrics to show that characteristic differences in cranial and mandibular shape between Neanderthals and modern humans arose very early during development, possibly prenatally, and were maintained throughout postnatal ontogeny. Postnatal differences in cranial ontogeny between the two taxa are characterized primarily by heterochronic modifications of a common spatial pattern of development. Evidence for early ontogenetic divergence together with evolutionary stasis of taxon-specific patterns of ontogeny is consistent with separation of Neanderthals and modern humans at the species level.
By the early 1980s, epidemiologists had identified many important causes of cancer. They had also proposed the 'multi-stage' model of cancer, although none of the hypothesized events in human carcinogenesis had then been identified. The remarkable advances in cell and molecular biology over the past two decades have transformed the scope and methods of cancer epidemiology. There have been a few new discoveries based purely on traditional methods, and many long-suspected minor risks have been estimated more precisely. But modern epidemiological studies often depend on genetic, biochemical or viral assays that had not been developed 20 years ago.
Transformations of serologic reaction patterns into verbal codes are analyzed. Two equally consistent and complementary models are compared. A model based on the assumption that antibodies are complex (cross-reacting) permits simpler, more uniform, and less prejudicing interpretations of immunogenetic systems than when antibodies are regarded as simple (specific).
Self-incompatibility (SI)--intraspecific pollen recognition systems that allow plants to avoid inbreeding--in the Solanaceae (the nightshade family) is controlled by a polymorphic S locus where "self" pollen is rejected on pistils with matching S alleles. In contrast, unilateral interspecific incompatibility (UI) prevents hybridization between related species, most commonly when the pollen donor is self-compatible (SC) and the recipient is SI. We observed that in Solanum, a pollen-expressed Cullin1 gene with high similarity to Petunia SI factors interacts genetically with a gene at or near the S locus to control UI. Cultivated tomato and related red- or orange-fruited species (all SC) exhibit the same loss-of-function mutation in this gene, whereas the green-fruited species (mostly SI) contain a functional allele; hence, similar biochemical mechanisms underlie the rejection of both "self" and interspecific pollen.
There are many possible spatial patterns of selection and gene flow that can produce a given cline structure; the actual geography of natural selection and gene flow must be worked out before an attempt is made to explain a given natural cline in terms of a model. The results of experimental and theoretical models show that it is possible for local differentiation to evolve parapatrically in spite of considerable gene flow if the selection gradients are relatively uniform. Irregularities in environmental gradients increase the sensitivity of clines to the effects of gene flow in proportion to the increase in the differences in gene frequencies between the emigrants and the demes receiving the immigrants. It is not necessary for a sharp spatial environmental change to be present for distinct differentiation to occur. In some cases even a gentle environmental gradient can give rise to marked spatial differentiation along a genetically continuous series of demes; such environmental differences may be below the practical limits of resolution in field studies. Any asymmetry in gene flow does not lead to dedifferentiation if the environmental gradient is smooth; it merely shifts the position of the transition zone between the differentiated areas from that which would be expected if there were no asymmetry. Abrupt geographic differences in gene, genotype, or morph frequencies should not, therefore, be interpreted as evidence for environmental changes in the immediate vicinity of the steepest part of the cline; neither should they be interpreted as evidence for geographic barriers, sharp environmental differences, or sexual isolation among the differentiated groups of populations when there are no other sources of evidence for these phenomena. Gene flow may be unimportant in the differentiation of populations along environmental gradients.
A mutation in the white gene of Drosophila mauritiana that results from insertion of the transposable element mariner is genetically unstable in both germ cells and somatic cells. Somatic instability is indicated by the occurrence of animals having mosaic eyes with patches of pigmented cells on a peach-colored background. Normally uncommon, the frequency of mosaicism is so greatly enhanced in a particular mutant strain that virtually every animal in the strain is an eye-color mosaic. The molecular basis of the mosaicism is the excision of the mariner element from its location in the DNA of the white gene in somatic cells. The phenomenon results from a single dominant genetic factor located in chromosome 3. Genetic control over the excision of transposable elements may play a role in determining the persistence of transposable elements in the genome.
The search to understand the mechanisms regulating brain wiring has relied on biochemical purification approaches in vertebrates and genetic approaches in invertebrates to identify molecular cues and receptors for axon guidance. Here we describe a phenotype-based gene-trap screen in mice designed for the large-scale identification of genes controlling the formation of the trillions of connections in the mammalian brain. The method incorporates an axonal marker, which helps to identify cell-autonomous mechanisms in axon guidance, and has generated a resource of mouse lines with striking patterns of axonal labelling, which facilitates analysis of the normal wiring diagram of the brain. Studies of two of these mouse lines have identified an in vivo guidance function for a vertebrate transmembrane semaphorin, Sema6A, and have helped re-evaluate that of the Eph receptor EphA4.
Here we studied the quantitative behaviour and cell-to-cell variability of a prototypical eukaryotic cell-fate decision system, the mating pheromone response pathway in yeast. We dissected and measured sources of variation in system output, analysing thousands of individual, genetically identical cells. Only a small proportion of total cell-to-cell variation is caused by random fluctuations in gene transcription and translation during the response ('expression noise'). Instead, variation is dominated by differences in the capacity of individual cells to transmit signals through the pathway ('pathway capacity') and to express proteins from genes ('expression capacity'). Cells with high expression capacity express proteins at a higher rate and increase in volume more rapidly. Our results identify two mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell variation in pathway capacity. First, the MAP kinase Fus3 suppresses variation at high pheromone levels, while the MAP kinase Kss1 enhances variation at low pheromone levels. Second, pathway capacity and expression capacity are negatively correlated, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that allows cells to respond more precisely to pheromone in the presence of a large variation in expression capacity.
The comparison of the genomes of two very closely related human mucosal pathogens, Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, has helped define the essential functions of a self-replicating minimal cell, as well as what constitutes a mycoplasma. Here we report the complete sequence of a more distant phylogenetic relative of those bacteria, Ureaplasma urealyticum (parvum biovar), which is also a mucosal pathogen of humans. It is the third mycoplasma to be sequenced, and has the smallest sequenced prokaryotic genome except for M. genitalium. Although the U. urealyticum genome is similar to the two sequenced mycoplasma genomes, features make this organism unique among mycoplasmas and all bacteria. Almost all ATP synthesis is the result of urea hydrolysis, which generates an energy-producing electrochemical gradient. Some highly conserved eubacterial enzymes appear not to be encoded by U. urealyticum, including the cell-division protein FtsZ, chaperonins GroES and GroEL, and ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase. U. urealyticum has six closely related iron transporters, which apparently arose through gene duplication, suggesting that it has a kind of respiration system not present in other small genome bacteria The genome is only 25.5% G+C in nucleotide content, and the G+C content of individual genes may predict how essential those genes are to ureaplasma survival.
Stem cells are found in various organs where they participate in tissue homeostasis by replacing differentiated cells lost to physiological turnover or injury. An investigation was performed to determine whether stem cells are restricted to produce specific cell types, namely, those from the tissue in which they reside. After transplantation into irradiated hosts, genetically labeled neural stem cells were found to produce a variety of blood cell types including myeloid and lymphoid cells as well as early hematopoietic cells. Thus, neural stem cells appear to have a wider differentiation potential than previously thought.
The graphical presentation of the results of complex computer model calculations is frequently as important as the computation, since it is generally through such presentations that the modeler and the modeler's audience derive the maximum amount of information. In this article graphical techniques for presenting multidimensional model results are reviewed and examples are given of the most useful forms of presentation. Color graphics is used increasingly for the presentation of model results, and three types of color displays are discussed here: the chromatic plot, the binary chromatic plot, and the ternary chromatic plot. Their use is illustrated with examples from computer modeling of air quality in the urban atmosphere.
The genomes of many (+)-stranded RNA viruses, including plant viruses and alphaviruses, consist of polycistronic RNAs whose internal genes are expressed via subgenomic messenger RNAs. The mechanism(s) by which these subgenomic mRNAs arise are poorly understood. Based on indirect evidence, three models have been proposed: (1) internal initiation by the replicase on the (-)-strand of genomic RNA, (2) premature termination during (-)-strand synthesis, followed by independent replication of the subgenomic RNA and (3) processing by nuclease cleavage of genome-length RNA. Using an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replicase) preparation from barley leaves infected with brome mosaic virus (BMV) to synthesize the viral subgenomic RNA in vitro, we now provide evidence that subgenomic RNA arises by internal initiation on the (-)-strand of genomic RNA. We believe that this also represents the first in vitro demonstration of a replicase from a eukaryotic (+)-stranded RNA virus capable of initiating synthesis of (+)-sense RNA.
Hexameric ring-shaped ATPases of the AAA + (for ATPases associated with various cellular activities) superfamily power cellular processes in which macromolecular structures and complexes are dismantled or denatured, but the mechanisms used by these machine-like enzymes are poorly understood. By covalently linking active and inactive subunits of the ATPase ClpX to form hexamers, here we show that diverse geometric arrangements can support the enzymatic unfolding of protein substrates and translocation of the denatured polypeptide into the ClpP peptidase for degradation. These studies indicate that the ClpX power stroke is generated by ATP hydrolysis in a single subunit, rule out concerted and strict sequential ATP hydrolysis models, and provide evidence for a probabilistic sequence of nucleotide hydrolysis. This mechanism would allow any ClpX subunit in contact with a translocating polypeptide to hydrolyse ATP to drive substrate spooling into ClpP, and would prevent stalling if one subunit failed to bind or hydrolyse ATP. Energy-dependent machines with highly diverse quaternary architectures and molecular functions could operate by similar asymmetric mechanisms.
In the visual system, the establishment of the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes in the retina and tectum during development is important for topographic retinotectal projection. We identified chick Ventroptin, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4), which is mainly expressed in the ventral retina, not only with a ventral high-dorsal low gradient but also with a nasal high-temporal low gradient at later stages. Misexpression of Ventroptin altered expression patterns of several topographic genes in the retina and projection of the retinal axons to the tectum along both axes. Thus, the topographic retinotectal projection appears to be specified by the double-gradient molecule Ventroptin along the two axes.
Feline and human mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI or Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) are inherited autosomal recessive deficiencies of lysosomal enzyme arylsulphatase B. Affected cats and children exhibit lesions caused by incompetent degradation, retinal atrophy and excessive urinary excretion of dermatan facial dysmorphia, corneal stromal opacities, leukocyte granulation, retinal atrophy and excessive urinary excretion of dermatan sulphate--and usually die before adulthood. Most attempts to treat humans affected with MPS VI or other mucopolysaccharidoses have been ineffective or logistically prohibitive, but allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) offers promise for cure of certain inborn errors of metabolism. Engraftment of normal donor marrow may endow the enzyme-deficient recipient with a continuous source of enzyme-competent blood cells and tissue macrophages to facilitate degradation of stored substrate and to prevent genesis of further malformations. To test this hypothesis, we performed allogeneic BMT in a 2-year-old male Siamese cat with advanced MPS VI. Here we describe BMT-induced correction of this hereditary enzyme deficiency.
Since the initial discovery that the DNase I sensitivity of the globin genes in different cell types correlates with globin gene expression, this relationship has been shown to hold true for a variety of genes, including the genes for ovalbumin, conalbumun, alpha- and beta-globin in chicken, several heat-shock proteins in Drosophila, the r-chromatin of Tetrahymena and the viral polyoma minichromosome. Although genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I and II have been studied extensively, the genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III have not. We have therefore investigated the DNase I sensitivity of transfer RNA (tRNA) and oogenetic 5S RNA genes in the liver and erythocyte nuclei of Xenopus laevis. The oogenetic 5S genes are not transcribed in any known somatic cell, and tRNA genes are transcribed in the hepatocyte but are inactive in the erythrocyte. We show here that, although in these two cell types the correspondence between DNase I sensitivity and gene transcription holds good for globin and the ribosomal genes, the tRNA and oogenetic 5S genes are DNase I sensitive in both liver and erythrocyte nuclei. Thus for the genes transcribed by polymerase III the correspondence of sensitivity and expression breaks down.
Dynamin, a crucial factor in endocytosis, is a member of a family of GTPases that participates in membrane fission. It was initially proposed to act as a machine that constricts and cuts the neck of nascent vesicles in a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent reaction, but subsequent studies suggested alternative models. Here we monitored the effect of nucleotides on dynamin-coated lipid tubules in real time. Addition of GTP, but not of GDP or GTP-gammaS, resulted in twisting of the tubules and supercoiling, suggesting a rotatory movement of the helix turns relative to each other during GTP hydrolysis. Rotation was confirmed by the movement of beads attached to the tubules. Twisting activity produced a longitudinal tension that was released by tubule breakage when both ends of the tubule were anchored. Fission also occurred when dynamin and GTP were added to lipid tubules that had been generated from liposomes by the motor activity of kinesin on microtubules. No fission events were observed in the absence of longitudinal tension. These findings demonstrate a mechanoenzyme activity of dynamin in endocytosis, but also imply that constriction is not sufficient for fission. At the short necks of endocytic vesicles, other factors leading to tension may cooperate with the constricting activity of dynamin to induce fission.
A Beltsville Small White turkey poult of parthenogenetic origin hatched in the spring of 1958, matured, and produced semen containing viable spermatozoa. Semen from this male was used in January 1959 to inseminate seven virgin and seven previously mated Beltsville Small White turkey hens. Three hundred and twenty eggs were incubated, of which 175 or 54.7 percent were infertile. One hundred and twenty-two poults, about equally divided as to sex, hatched unaided from 145 fertile eggs.
A long-standing hypothesis posits that natural selection can favour two female strategies when density cycles. At low density, females producing many smaller progeny are favoured when the intrinsic rate of increase, r, governs population growth. At peak density, females producing fewer, high-quality, progeny are favoured when the carrying capacity, K, is exceeded and the population crashes. Here we report on the first example of a genetic r versus K selection game that promotes stable population cycles in lizards. Decade-long fitness studies and game theory demonstrated that two throat-colour morphs were refined by selection in which the strength of natural selection varied with density. Orange-throated females, r strategists, produced many eggs and were favoured at low density. Conversely, yellow-throated females, K strategists, produced large eggs and were favoured at high density. Progeny size should also be under negative frequency-dependent selection in that large progeny will have a survival advantage when rare, but the advantage disappears when they become common. We confirmed this prediction by seeding field plots with rare and common giant hatchlings. Thus, intrinsic causes of frequency- and density-dependent selection promotes an evolutionary game with two-generation oscillations.
Genetic selections were used to find peptides that inhibit biological pathways in budding yeast. The peptides were presented inside cells as peptamers, surface loops on a highly expressed and biologically inert carrier protein, a catalytically inactive derivative of staphylococcal nuclease. Peptamers that inhibited the pheromone signaling pathway, transcriptional silencing, and the spindle checkpoint were isolated. Putative targets for the inhibitors were identified by a combination of two-hybrid analysis and genetic dissection of the target pathways. This analysis identified Ydr517w as a component of the spindle checkpoint and reinforced earlier indications that Ste50 has both positive and negative roles in pheromone signaling. Analysis of transcript arrays showed that the peptamers were highly specific in their effects, which suggests that they may be useful reagents in organisms that lack sophisticated genetics as well as for identifying components of existing biological pathways that are potential targets for drug discovery.
The Mammalian Comparative Database provides genetic maps of mammalian species. Comparative maps are valuable aids for predicting linkages, developing animal models and studying genome organization and evolution.
It is currently debated whether segmentation in different animal phyla has a common origin and shares a common genetic mechanism. The apparent use of different genetic networks in arthropods and vertebrates has become a strong argument against a common origin of segmentation. Our knowledge of arthropod segmentation is based mainly on the insect Drosophila, in which a hierarchical cascade of transcription factors controls segmentation. The function of some of these genes seems to be conserved among arthropods, including spiders, but not vertebrates. The Notch pathway has a key role in vertebrate segmentation (somitogenesis) but is not involved in Drosophila body segmentation. Here we show that Notch and Delta genes are involved in segmentation of another arthropod, the spider Cupiennius salei. Expression patterns of Notch and Delta, coupled with RNA interference experiments, identify many similarities between spider segmentation and vertebrate somitogenesis. Our data indicate that formation of the segments in arthropods and vertebrates may have shared a genetic programme in a common ancestor and that parts of this programme have been lost in particular descendant lineages.
Loss-of-function genetic screens in model organisms have elucidated numerous biological processes, but the diploid genome of mammalian cells has precluded large-scale gene disruption. We used insertional mutagenesis to develop a screening method to generate null alleles in a human cell line haploid for all chromosomes except chromosome 8. Using this approach, we identified host factors essential for infection with influenza and genes encoding important elements of the biosynthetic pathway of diphthamide, which are required for the cytotoxic effects of diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A. We also identified genes needed for the action of cytolethal distending toxin, including a cell-surface protein that interacts with the toxin. This approach has both conceptual and practical parallels with genetic approaches in haploid yeast.
Mathematical models predict that species interactions such as competition and predation can generate chaos. However, experimental demonstrations of chaos in ecology are scarce, and have been limited to simple laboratory systems with a short duration and artificial species combinations. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a long-term experiment with a complex food web. Our food web was isolated from the Baltic Sea, and consisted of bacteria, several phytoplankton species, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton species, and detritivores. The food web was cultured in a laboratory mesocosm, and sampled twice a week for more than 2,300 days. Despite constant external conditions, the species abundances showed striking fluctuations over several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations displayed a variety of different periodicities, which could be attributed to different species interactions in the food web. The population dynamics were characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents of similar magnitude for each species. Predictability was limited to a time horizon of 15-30 days, only slightly longer than the local weather forecast. Hence, our results demonstrate that species interactions in food webs can generate chaos. This implies that stability is not required for the persistence of complex food webs, and that the long-term prediction of species abundances can be fundamentally impossible.
One of the major limitations in the use of genetically modified mice for studying cognitive functions is the lack of regional and temporal control of gene function. To overcome these limitations, a forebrain-specific promoter was combined with the tetracycline transactivator system to achieve both regional and temporal control of transgene expression. Expression of an activated calcium-independent form of calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) resulted in a loss of hippocampal long-term potentiation in response to 10-hertz stimulation and a deficit in spatial memory, a form of explicit memory. Suppression of transgene expression reversed both the physiological and the memory deficit. When the transgene was expressed at high levels in the lateral amygdala and the striatum but not other forebrain structures, there was a deficit in fear conditioning, an implicit memory task, that also was reversible. Thus, the CaMKII signaling pathway is critical for both explicit and implicit memory storage, in a manner that is independent of its potential role in development.
The I-E molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) can prevent the spontaneous development of diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. The mechanism of this protection has been investigated by breeding wild-type and promoter-mutated E kappa alpha transgenes onto the NOD genetic background. Animals carrying the various mutated transgenes expressed I-E on different subsets of immunocompetent cells, and thus cells important for the I-E protective effect could be identified. Although the wild-type transgene prevented the infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets, none of the mutants did. However, all of the transgenes could mediate the intrathymic elimination of T cells bearing antigen receptors with variable regions that recognize I-E. Thus, the I-E molecule does not protect NOD mice from diabetes simply by inducing the deletion of self-reactive T cells.
Contemporary acceleration of biodiversity loss makes increasingly urgent the need to understand the controls of species coexistence. Tree diversity in particular plays a pivotal role in determining terrestrial biodiversity, through maintaining diversity of its dependent species and with them, their predators and parasites. Most theories of coexistence based on the principle of limiting similarity suggest that coexistence of competing species is inherently unstable; coexistence of competitors must be maintained by external forces such as disturbance, immigration or 'patchiness' of resources in space and time. In contrast, storage theory postulates stable coexistence of competing species through temporal alternation of conditions favouring recruitment of one species over the other. Here we use storage theory to develop explicit predictions for relative differences between competitors that allow us to discriminate between coexistence models. Data on tree species from a primary forest on the Mexican Pacific coast support a general dynamic of storage processes determining coexistence of similar tree species in this community, and allow us to reject all other theories of coexistence.
The activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains the least curable form of this malignancy despite recent advances in therapy. Constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-kB and JAK kinase signalling promotes malignant cell survival in these lymphomas, but the genetic basis for this signalling is incompletely understood. Here we describe the dependence of ABC DLBCLs on MYD88, an adaptor protein that mediates toll and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor signalling, and the discovery of highly recurrent oncogenic mutations affecting MYD88 in ABC DLBCL tumours. RNA interference screening revealed that MYD88 and the associated kinases IRAK1 and IRAK4 are essential for ABC DLBCL survival. High-throughput RNA resequencing uncovered MYD88 mutations in ABC DLBCL lines. Notably, 29% of ABC DLBCL tumours harboured the same amino acid substitution, L265P, in the MYD88 Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain at an evolutionarily invariant residue in its hydrophobic core. This mutation was rare or absent in other DLBCL subtypes and Burkitt's lymphoma, but was observed in 9% of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. At a lower frequency, additional mutations were observed in the MYD88 TIR domain, occurring in both the ABC and germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subtypes. Survival of ABC DLBCL cells bearing the L265P mutation was sustained by the mutant but not the wild-type MYD88 isoform, demonstrating that L265P is a gain-of-function driver mutation. The L265P mutant promoted cell survival by spontaneously assembling a protein complex containing IRAK1 and IRAK4, leading to IRAK4 kinase activity, IRAK1 phosphorylation, NF-kB signalling, JAK kinase activation of STAT3, and secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and interferon-b. Hence, the MYD88 signalling pathway is integral to the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL, supporting the development of inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase and other components of this pathway for the treatment of tumours bearing oncogenic MYD88 mutations.
Tyrosinase inhibitor (molecular weight less than 5000; extracted from various melanomas) fully inhibits soluble tyrosinase but only partially inhibits tyrosinase "aggregated" into melanosomes; the inhibitor can be inactivated by ultraviolet light. S91 Albinotyrosinase Type B apparently cannot "aggregate" into melanosomes because its protein carrier is genetically altered. Therefore, albinotyrosinase remains vulnerable to its inhibitor and cannot produce melanin, even though the enzyme has a functioning active center.
One of the identifying characteristics of tetrapods (limbed vertebrates) is the presence of fingers and toes. Whereas the proximal part of the tetrapod limb skeleton can easily be homologized with the paired fin skeletons of sarcopterygian (lobe-finned) fish, there has been much debate about the origin of digits. Early hypotheses interpreted digits as derivatives of fin radials, but during the 1990s the idea gained acceptance that digits are evolutionary novelties without direct equivalents in fish fin skeletons. This was partly based on developmental genetic data, but also substantially on the pectoral fin skeleton of the elpistostegid (transitional fish/tetrapod) Panderichthys, which appeared to lack distal digit-like radials. Here we present a CT scan study of an undisturbed pectoral fin of Panderichthys demonstrating that the plate-like 'ulnare' of previous reconstructions is an artefact and that distal radials are in fact present. This distal portion is more tetrapod-like than that found in Tiktaalik and, in combination with new data about fin development in basal actinopterygians, sharks and lungfish, makes a strong case for fingers not being a novelty of tetrapods but derived from pre-existing distal radials present in all sarcopterygian fish.
A central focus of postgenomic research will be to understand how cellular phenomena arise from the connectivity of genes and proteins. This connectivity generates molecular network diagrams that resemble complex electrical circuits, and a systematic understanding will require the development of a mathematical framework for describing the circuitry. From an engineering perspective, the natural path towards such a framework is the construction and analysis of the underlying submodules that constitute the network. Recent experimental advances in both sequencing and genetic engineering have made this approach feasible through the design and implementation of synthetic gene networks amenable to mathematical modelling and quantitative analysis. These developments have signalled the emergence of a gene circuit discipline, which provides a framework for predicting and evaluating the dynamics of cellular processes. Synthetic gene networks will also lead to new logical forms of cellular control, which could have important applications in functional genomics, nanotechnology, and gene and cell therapy.
Small doses of the opiate antagonist naloxone selectively abolished overeating in genetically obese mice (ob/ob) and rats (fa/fa). Elevated concentrations of the naturally occurring opiate beta-endorphin were found in the pituitaries of both obese species and in the blood plasma of the obese rats. Brain levels of beta-endorphin and Leu-enkephalin were unchanged. These data suggest that excess pituitary beta-endorphin may play a role in the development of the overeating and obesity syndrome.
Although data on nucleotide sequence variation in the human nuclear genome have begun to accumulate, little is known about genomic diversity in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus). A 10,154-base pair sequence on the chimpanzee X chromosome is reported, representing all major subspecies and bonobos. Comparison to humans shows the diversity of the chimpanzee sequences to be almost four times as high and the age of the most recent common ancestor three times as great as the corresponding values of humans. Phylogenetic analyses show the sequences from the different chimpanzee subspecies to be intermixed and the distance between some chimpanzee sequences to be greater than the distance between them and the bonobo sequences.
Alternative promoters within the same gene are a general phenomenon in gene expression. Mechanisms of their selective regulation vary from one gene to another and are still poorly understood. Here we show that in quiescent cells the mechanism of transcriptional repression of the major promoter of the gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase depends on a non-coding transcript initiated from the upstream minor promoter and involves both the direct interaction of the RNA and promoter-specific interference. The specificity and efficiency of repression is ensured by the formation of a stable complex between non-coding RNA and the major promoter, direct interaction of the non-coding RNA with the general transcription factor IIB and dissociation of the preinitiation complex from the major promoter. By using in vivo and in vitro assays such as inducible and reconstituted transcription, RNA bandshifts, RNA interference, chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation, we show that the regulatory transcript produced from the minor promoter has a critical function in an epigenetic mechanism of promoter-specific transcriptional repression.
BRAF and NRAS are common targets for somatic mutations in benign and malignant neoplasms that arise from melanocytes situated in epithelial structures, and lead to constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. However, BRAF and NRAS mutations are absent in a number of other melanocytic neoplasms in which the equivalent oncogenic events are currently unknown. Here we report frequent somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunit, GNAQ, in blue naevi (83%) and ocular melanoma of the uvea (46%). The mutations occur exclusively in codon 209 in the Ras-like domain and result in constitutive activation, turning GNAQ into a dominant acting oncogene. Our results demonstrate an alternative route to MAP kinase activation in melanocytic neoplasia, providing new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.
Three groups of indigo buntings were hand-raised in various conditions of visual isolation from celestial cues. When they had been prevented from viewing the night sky prior to the autumn migration season, birds tested under planetarium skies were unable to select the normal migration direction. By contrast, when they had been exposed as juveniles to a normal, rotating, planetarium sky, individuals displayed typical southerly directional preferences. The third group was exposed to an incorrect planetarium sky in which the stars rotated about a fictitious axis. When tested during the autumn, these birds took up the "correct" migration direction relative to the new axis of rotation. These results fail to support the hypothesis of a "genetic star map." They suggest, instead, a maturation process in which stellar cues come to be associated with a directional reference system provided by the axis of celestial rotation.
The recognition of transfer-RNA by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is the crucial step in the translation of the genetic code. In order to construct a structural model of the complex between the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrTS) from Bacillus stearothermophilus and tRNATyr, 40 basic residues at the surface of the TyrTS dimer have been mutated by site-directed mutagenesis and heterodimers created in vitro by recombining subunits derived from different mutants. As reported here a cluster of basic residues (Arg 207-Lys 208) in the N-terminal domain of one TyrTS subunit interacts with the acceptor stem of tRNATyr and two separated clusters of basic residues (Arg 368-Arg 371; Arg 407-Arg 408-Lys 410-Lys 411) in the C-terminal domain of the other subunit interact with the anticodon arm. The TyrTS would thus clamp the tRNA in a fixed orientation. The precise alignment of the flexible... ACCA 3' end of the tRNA for attack on the tyrosyl adenylate is made by contacts closer to the catalytic groups of the enzyme, such as with Lys 151.
Signaling molecules are essential for vertebrate embryonic development. Here, two Xenopus homologs of the Drosophila gene fringe, lunatic Fringe (lFng) and radical Fringe (rFng), were identified and the protein product of lFng further characterized. The messenger RNA of lFng is supplied as a maternal message. Its product is a precursor protein consisting of pre-, pro-, and mature regions. The mature lunatic Fringe protein is secreted extracellularly, and it induced mesodermal tissue formation in animal cap assays. These results indicate that secreted lunatic Fringe can induce mesoderm and reveal that the Fringe proteins are a family of vertebrate signaling molecules.
Large hypodermal cells with giant polytene chromosomes are present within the developing feet of Sarcophaga and other fly pupae. The cells secrete a large volume of cuticle; at this time there is extensive "puffing" of the chromosomes. Being hypodermal and superficially situated with permanent secretory products, the cells could be ideal experimental and genetical tools.
The nuclear protein DET1 is a central repressor of photomorphogenesis in plants. We have identified the molecular lesion in ted3, a mutation that dominantly suppresses the phenotypes of det1-1. TED3 encodes a peroxisomal protein (AtPex2p) essential for Arabidopsis growth. Developmental defects and the abnormal expression of many genes in det1 are rescued by ted3. ted3 also partially suppresses another pleiotropic de-etiolated mutant cop1. Thus, peroxisomes, whose functions are still largely unexplored, play a key role in a photomorphogenetic pathway negatively regulated by the DET1 and COP proteins.
Osteoporosis and other diseases of bone loss are a major public health problem. Here it is shown that the statins, drugs widely used for lowering serum cholesterol, also enhance new bone formation in vitro and in rodents. This effect was associated with increased expression of the bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) gene in bone cells. Lovastatin and simvastatin increased bone formation when injected subcutaneously over the calvaria of mice and increased cancellous bone volume when orally administered to rats. Thus, in appropriate doses, statins may have therapeutic applications for the treatment of osteoporosis.
Animals sustain the ability to operate after injury by creating qualitatively different compensatory behaviors. Although such robustness would be desirable in engineered systems, most machines fail in the face of unexpected damage. We describe a robot that can recover from such change autonomously, through continuous self-modeling. A four-legged machine uses actuation-sensation relationships to indirectly infer its own structure, and it then uses this self-model to generate forward locomotion. When a leg part is removed, it adapts the self-models, leading to the generation of alternative gaits. This concept may help develop more robust machines and shed light on self-modeling in animals.
Some cases of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) are due to alterations in a mutS-related mismatch repair gene. A search of a large database of expressed sequence tags derived from random complementary DNA clones revealed three additional human mismatch repair genes, all related to the bacterial mutL gene. One of these genes (hMLH1) resides on chromosome 3p21, within 1 centimorgan of markers previously linked to cancer susceptibility in HNPCC kindreds. Mutations of hMLH1 that would disrupt the gene product were identified in such kindreds, demonstrating that this gene is responsible for the disease. These results suggest that defects in any of several mismatch repair genes can cause HNPCC.
To generate efficient vaccines and cures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we need a far better understanding of its modes of infection, persistence, and spreading. Host cell entry and the establishment of a replication niche are well understood, but little is known about how tubercular mycobacteria exit host cells and disseminate the infection. Using the social amoeba Dictyostelium as a genetically tractable host for pathogenic mycobacteria, we discovered that M. tuberculosis and M. marinum, but not M. avium, are ejected from the cell through an actin-based structure, the ejectosome. This conserved nonlytic spreading mechanism requires a cytoskeleton regulator from the host and an intact mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system. This insight offers new directions for research into the spreading of tubercular mycobacteria infections in mammalian cells.
Mice and cattle with genetic deficiencies in myostatin exhibit dramatic increases in skeletal muscle mass, suggesting that myostatin normally suppresses muscle growth. Whether this increased muscling results from prenatal or postnatal lack of myostatin activity is unknown. Here we show that myostatin circulates in the blood of adult mice in a latent form that can be activated by acid treatment. Systemic overexpression of myostatin in adult mice was found to induce profound muscle and fat loss analogous to that seen in human cachexia syndromes. These data indicate that myostatin acts systemically in adult animals and may be a useful pharmacologic target in clinical settings such as cachexia, where muscle growth is desired.
Chickens sexed as females in commercial flocks show a low frequency of intersex individuals. Gross anatomical examination of the intersexes revealed malformed gonads. Histological examination proved that these gonads were not ovotestes but were composed of testicular tissues. Karyotype analysis of 15 intersex individuals showed 13 of them to be 3A-ZZW triploids (normal females are 2A-ZW) while the other 2 were mosaic for male and female karyotypes. Red blood cell volume accurately reflects the ploidy level and is suggested for use in screening for polyploids. Intersex triploids may develop parthenogenetically or from fertilization between reduced and unreduced gametes.
In the plant RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, 21-nucleotide duplexes of small interfering RNA (siRNA) are processed from longer double-stranded RNA precursors by the RNaseIII Dicer-like 4 (DCL4). Single-stranded siRNAs then guide Argonaute 1 (AGO1) to execute posttranscriptional silencing of complementary target RNAs. RNAi is not cell-autonomous in higher plants, but the nature of the mobile nucleic acid(s) signal remains unknown. Using cell-specific rescue of DCL4 function and cell-specific inhibition of RNAi movement, we genetically establish that exogenous and endogenous siRNAs, as opposed to their precursor molecules, act as mobile silencing signals between plant cells. We further demonstrate physical movement of mechanically delivered, labeled siRNA duplexes that functionally recapitulate transgenic RNAi spread. Cell-to-cell movement is unlikely to involve AGO1-bound siRNA single strands, but instead likely involves siRNA duplexes.
Horizontal transfer (HT), or the passage of genetic material between non-mating species, is increasingly recognized as an important force in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. Transposons, with their inherent ability to mobilize and amplify within genomes, may be especially prone to HT. However, the means by which transposons can spread across widely diverged species remain elusive. Here we present evidence that host-parasite interactions have promoted the HT of four transposon families between invertebrates and vertebrates. We found that Rhodnius prolixus, a triatomine bug feeding on the blood of various tetrapods and vector of Chagas' disease in humans, carries in its genome four distinct transposon families that also invaded the genomes of a diverse, but overlapping, set of tetrapods. The bug transposons are approximately 98% identical and cluster phylogenetically with those of the opossum and squirrel monkey, two of its preferred mammalian hosts in South America. We also identified one of these transposon families in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a cosmopolitan vector of trematodes infecting diverse vertebrates, whose ancestral sequence is nearly identical and clusters with those found in Old World mammals. Together these data provide evidence for a previously hypothesized role of host-parasite interactions in facilitating HT among animals. Furthermore, the large amount of DNA generated by the amplification of the horizontally transferred transposons supports the idea that the exchange of genetic material between hosts and parasites influences their genomic evolution.
During genetic recombination and the recombinational repair of chromosome breaks, DNA molecules become linked at points of strand exchange. Branch migration and resolution of these crossovers, or Holliday junctions (HJs), complete the recombination process. Here, we show that extracts from cells carrying mutations in the recombination/repair genes RAD51C or XRCC3 have reduced levels of HJ resolvase activity. Moreover, depletion of RAD51C from fractionated human extracts caused a loss of branch migration and resolution activity, but these functions were restored by complementation with a variety of RAD51 paralog complexes containing RAD51C. We conclude that the RAD51 paralogs are involved in HJ processing in human cells.
Crown gall tumors are induced in plants by infection with the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Because the tumor induction involves transfer of a portion of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid DNA from the bacterium to the plant cells, this system is of interest for the study of genetic exchange as well as tumor induction. The boundaries of the transferred DNA (T-DNA) have been cloned from transformed plant cells of tobacco. Detailed mapping with restriction enzymes and nucleotide sequence analysis of two independent clones were used to study the molecular structure of the ends of the T-DNA. One clone contains the two ends of the T-DNA joined together; the other contains one end of the T-DNA joined to repetitive plant DNA sequences. These studies provide direct evidence that the T-DNA can be integrated into the plant genome. In addition, the data suggest that in the plant, T-DNA can be tandemly repeated. Sequence analysis of the junction of crown gall clone 1 reveals several direct repeats as well as an inverted repeat; these structures may be involved in the transfer of the DNA from Agrobacterium to plant cells.
Germ cells have the unique capacity to start a new life upon fertilization. They are generated during a sex-specific differentiation programme called gametogenesis. Maturation of germ cells is characterized by an impressive degree of cellular restructuring and gene regulation that involves remarkable genomic reorganization. These events are finely tuned, but are also susceptible to the introduction of various types of error. Because stable genetic transmission to future generations is essential for life, understanding the control of these processes has far-reaching implications for human health and reproduction.
Chromophyte algae differ fundamentally from plants in possessing chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll c and that have a more complex bounding-membrane topology. Although chromophytes are known to be evolutionary chimaeras of a red alga and a non-photosynthetic host, which gave rise to their exceptional membrane complexity, their cell biology is poorly understood. Cryptomonads are the only chromophytes that still retain the enslaved red algal nucleus as a minute nucleomorph. Here we report complete sequences for all three nucleomorph chromosomes from the cryptomonad Guillardia theta. This tiny 551-kilobase eukaryotic genome is the most gene-dense known, with only 17 diminutive spliceosomal introns and 44 overlapping genes. Marked evolutionary compaction hundreds of millions of years ago eliminated nearly all the nucleomorph genes for metabolic functions, but left 30 for chloroplast-located proteins. To allow expression of these proteins, nucleomorphs retain hundreds of genetic-housekeeping genes. Nucleomorph DNA replication and periplastid protein synthesis require the import of many nuclear gene products across endoplasmic reticulum and periplastid membranes. The chromosomes have centromeres, but possibly only one loop domain, offering a means for studying eukaryotic chromosome replication, segregation and evolution.
African trypanosomes evade the host immune response by periodically switching their variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat. The resulting, serologically distinct variant antigenic types (VATs) appear in a loosely ordered sequence and those arising early in infections are termed predominant VATs. VAT switching reflects the successive transcriptional activation of single VSG genes from a large repertoire. Activation of some VSG genes is accomplished by duplication of a previously silent basic copy (BC) gene and insertion of this expression linked copy (ELC) near a chromosomal telomere where is is expressed. However, other VSG genes, always located near a telomere, use a non-duplication activation ( NDA ) mechanism. We report here that the gene encoding the predominant IsTat 1.A VSG can be activated with or without duplication. Four of six independently derived clones activated the 1.A gene without gene duplication or detectable rearrangement. The other two contained an active 1.A ELC, possibly generated by a gene conversion extending to the end of the telomere. The ability to utilize both NDA and ELC mechanisms of gene activation and perhaps an alternative mechanism for gene duplication may account for the fact that VAT 1.A is the most predominant VAT of the IsTaR 1 serodeme .
A phytochrome-like protein called Ppr was discovered in the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum centenum. Ppr has a photoactive yellow protein (PYP) amino-terminal domain, a central domain with similarity to phytochrome, and a carboxyl-terminal histidine kinase domain. Reconstitution experiments demonstrate that Ppr covalently attaches the blue light-absorbing chromophore p-hydroxycinnamic acid and that it has a photocycle that is spectrally similar to, but kinetically slower than, that of PYP. Ppr also regulates chalcone synthase gene expression in response to blue light with autophosphorylation inhibited in vitro by blue light. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that R. centenum Ppr may be ancestral to cyanobacterial and plant phytochromes.
In our view, gene therapy may ameliorate some human genetic diseases in the future. For this reason, we believe that research directed at the development of techniques for gene therapy should continue. For the foreseeable future, however, we oppose any further attempts at gene therapy in human patients because (i) our understanding of such basic processes as gene regulation and genetic recombination in human cells is inadequate; (ii) our understanding of the details of the relation between the molecular defect and the disease state is rudimentary for essentially all genetic diseases; and (iii) we have no information on the short-range and long-term side effects of gene therapy. We therefore propose that a sustained effort be made to formulate a complete set of ethicoscientific criteria to guide the development and clinical application of gene therapy techniques. Such an endeavor could go a long way toward ensuring that gene therapy is used in humans only in those instances where it will prove beneficial, and toward preventing its misuse through premature application. Two recent papers have provided new demonstrations of directed genetic modification of mammalian cells. Munyon et al. (44) restored the ability to synthesize the enzyme thymidine kinase to thymidine kinase-deficient mouse cells by infection with ultraviolet-irradiated herpes simplex virus. In their experiments the DNA from herpes simplex virus, which contains a gene coding for thymidine kinase, may have formed a hereditable association with the mouse cells. Merril et al. (45) reported that treatment of fibroblasts from patients with galactosemia with exogenous DNA caused increased activity of a missing enzyme, alpha-D-galactose-l-phosphate uridyltransferase. They also provided some evidence that the change persisted after subculturing the treated cells. If this latter report can be confirmed, the feasibility of directed genetic modification of human cells would be clearly demonstrated, considerably enhancing the technical prospects for gene therapy.
Cohesin-mediated sister chromatid cohesion is essential for chromosome segregation and post-replicative DNA repair. In addition, evidence from model organisms and from human genetics suggests that cohesin is involved in the control of gene expression. This non-canonical role has recently been rationalized by the findings that mammalian cohesin complexes are recruited to a subset of DNase I hypersensitive sites and to conserved noncoding sequences by the DNA-binding protein CTCF. CTCF functions at insulators (which control interactions between enhancers and promoters) and at boundary elements (which demarcate regions of distinct chromatin structure), and cohesin contributes to its enhancer-blocking activity. The underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and the full spectrum of cohesin functions remains to be determined. Here we show that cohesin forms the topological and mechanistic basis for cell-type-specific long-range chromosomal interactions in cis at the developmentally regulated cytokine locus IFNG. Hence, the ability of cohesin to constrain chromosome topology is used not only for the purpose of sister chromatid cohesion, but also to dynamically define the spatial conformation of specific loci. This new aspect of cohesin function is probably important for normal development and disease.
Inherited rickettsial symbionts of the genus Wolbachia occur commonly in arthropods and have been implicated in the expression of parthenogenesis, feminization and cytoplasmic incompatibility Wolbachia from the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, to replace the natural infection of Drosophila simulans by means of embryonic microinjection techniques. The transferred Wolbachia infection behaves like a natural Drosophila infection with regard to its inheritance, cytoskeleton interactions and ability to induce incompatibility when crossed with uninfected flies. The transinfected flies are bidirectionally incompatible with all other naturally infected strains of Drosophila simulans, however, and as such represent a unique crossing type. The successful transfer of this symbiont between distantly related hosts suggests that it may be possible to introduce this agent experimentally into arthropod species of medical and agricultural importance in order to manipulate natural populations genetically.
Spermatozoa from a single male will compete for fertilization of ova with spermatozoa from another male when present in the female reproductive tract at the same time. Close genetic relatedness predisposes individuals towards altruism, and as haploid germ cells of an ejaculate will have genotypic similarity of 50%, it is predicted that spermatozoa may display cooperation and altruism to gain an advantage when inter-male sperm competition is intense. We report here the probable altruistic behaviour of spermatozoa in an eutherian mammal. Spermatozoa of the common wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, displayed a unique morphological transformation resulting in cooperation in distinctive aggregations or 'trains' of hundreds or thousands of cells, which significantly increased sperm progressive motility. Eventual dispersal of sperm trains was associated with most of the spermatozoa undergoing a premature acrosome reaction. Cells undergoing an acrosome reaction in aggregations remote from the egg are altruistic in that they help sperm transport to the egg but compromise their own fertilizing ability.
The proteins encoded by the myc proto-oncogene family are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and neoplasia. Myc acts through dimerization with Max to bind DNA and activate transcription. Homologs of the myc and max genes were cloned from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and their protein products (dMyc and dMax) were shown to heterodimerize, recognize the same DNA sequence as their vertebrate homologs, and activate transcription. The dMyc protein is likely encoded by the Drosophila gene diminutive (dm), a mutation in which results in small body size and female sterility caused by degeneration of the ovaries. These findings indicate a potential role for Myc in germ cell development and set the stage for genetic analysis of Myc and Max.
Evans et al. and Mekel-Bobrov et al. (Reports, 9 September 2005, p. 1717 and 1720, respectively) reported that human genetic variants of Microcephalin (MCPH1) and abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated (ASPM) are under strong positive selection. We genotyped these variants in 9000 children and find no meaningful associations with brain size and various cognitive measures, which indicates that contrary to previous speculations, ASPM and MCPH1 have not been selected for brain-related effects.
The Dalmatian coach hound appears to lack a mediated transport system for uric acid, which can be demonstrated in the erythrocytes of other dogs by hypoxanthine inhibition of uric acid uptake. This transport deficiency may be a manifestation of a genetic defect which has different metabolic consequences in the liver, in the kidney, and in other tissues, depending on the direction of their differentiation
Progerias are rare genetic diseases characterized by premature aging. Several progeroid disorders are caused by mutations that lead to the accumulation of a lipid-modified (farnesylated) form of prelamin A, a protein that contributes to the structural scaffolding for the cell nucleus. In progeria, the accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A disrupts this scaffolding, leading to misshapen nuclei. Previous studies have shown that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) reverse this cellular abnormality. We tested the efficacy of an FTI (ABT-100) in Zmpste24-deficient mice, a mouse model of progeria. The FTI-treated mice exhibited improved body weight, grip strength, bone integrity, and percent survival at 20 weeks of age. These results suggest that FTIs may have beneficial effects in humans with progeria.
Lancelets ('amphioxus') are the modern survivors of an ancient chordate lineage, with a fossil record dating back to the Cambrian period. Here we describe the structure and gene content of the highly polymorphic approximately 520-megabase genome of the Florida lancelet Branchiostoma floridae, and analyse it in the context of chordate evolution. Whole-genome comparisons illuminate the murky relationships among the three chordate groups (tunicates, lancelets and vertebrates), and allow not only reconstruction of the gene complement of the last common chordate ancestor but also partial reconstruction of its genomic organization, as well as a description of two genome-wide duplications and subsequent reorganizations in the vertebrate lineage. These genome-scale events shaped the vertebrate genome and provided additional genetic variation for exploitation during vertebrate evolution.
Sequence-directed variations in the canonical DNA double helix structure that retain Watson-Crick base-pairing have important roles in DNA recognition, topology and nucleosome positioning. By using nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion spectroscopy in concert with steered molecular dynamics simulations, we have observed transient sequence-specific excursions away from Watson-Crick base-pairing at CA and TA steps inside canonical duplex DNA towards low-populated and short-lived A*T and G*C Hoogsteen base pairs. The observation of Hoogsteen base pairs in DNA duplexes specifically bound to transcription factors and in damaged DNA sites implies that the DNA double helix intrinsically codes for excited state Hoogsteen base pairs as a means of expanding its structural complexity beyond that which can be achieved based on Watson-Crick base-pairing. The methods presented here provide a new route for characterizing transient low-populated nucleic acid structures, which we predict will be abundant in the genome and constitute a second transient layer of the genetic code.
We have identified 242 Anopheles gambiae genes from 18 gene families implicated in innate immunity and have detected marked diversification relative to Drosophila melanogaster. Immune-related gene families involved in recognition, signal modulation, and effector systems show a marked deficit of orthologs and excessive gene expansions, possibly reflecting selection pressures from different pathogens encountered in these insects' very different life-styles. In contrast, the multifunctional Toll signal transduction pathway is substantially conserved, presumably because of counterselection for developmental stability. Representative expression profiles confirm that sequence diversification is accompanied by specific responses to different immune challenges. Alternative RNA splicing may also contribute to expansion of the immune repertoire.
Non-mammalian vertebrates have an intrinsically photosensitive iris and thus a local pupillary light reflex (PLR). In contrast, it is thought that the PLR in mammals generally requires neuronal circuitry connecting the eye and the brain. Here we report that an intrinsic component of the PLR is in fact widespread in nocturnal and crepuscular mammals. In mouse, this intrinsic PLR requires the visual pigment melanopsin; it also requires PLCb4, a vertebrate homologue of the Drosophila NorpA phospholipase C which mediates rhabdomeric phototransduction. The Plcb4(-/-) genotype, in addition to removing the intrinsic PLR, also essentially eliminates the intrinsic light response of the M1 subtype of melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (M1-ipRGCs), which are by far the most photosensitive ipRGC subtype and also have the largest response to light. Ablating in mouse the expression of both TRPC6 and TRPC7, members of the TRP channel superfamily, also essentially eliminated the M1-ipRGC light response but the intrinsic PLR was not affected. Thus, melanopsin signalling exists in both iris and retina, involving a PLCb4-mediated pathway that nonetheless diverges in the two locations.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many risk loci for complex diseases, but effect sizes are typically small and information on the underlying biological processes is often lacking. Associations with metabolic traits as functional intermediates can overcome these problems and potentially inform individualized therapy. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with non-targeted metabolomics. We identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood metabolite concentrations, of which 25 show effect sizes that are unusually high for GWAS and account for 10-60% differences in metabolite levels per allele copy. Our associations provide new functional insights for many disease-related associations that have been reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism and Crohn's disease. The study advances our knowledge of the genetic basis of metabolic individuality in humans and generates many new hypotheses for biomedical and pharmaceutical research.
The major problem in the study of T-cell development is that of tracking thymocytes of a given specificity. Recent studies have exploited natural correlations between the expression of a particular V beta gene segment and T-cell receptor (TCR) specificity. We and others (refs 5, 6 and M. Davis, personal communication) have taken an alternative approach. We have generated transgenic mice expressing the alpha beta antigen receptor from the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone 2C (ref. 7). In transgenic mice of the same haplotype as the 2C clone, the 2C TCR was expressed on 20-95% of peripheral T cells. Very few of these T cells carried the CD4 antigen; the vast majority were CD4-CD8+ and were able to lyse targets with the same specificity as the original 2C clone. These results indicate that the alpha beta heterodimer transfers specificity to recipient cells as expected from earlier studies, and that receptor specificity in T-cell repertoire selection is determined by both alpha beta heterodimer and CD4 or CD8 accessory molecules.
The conventional objective of vaccination programmes is to eliminate infection by reducing the reproduction number of an infectious agent to less than one, which generally requires vaccination of the majority of individuals. In populations of endangered wildlife, the intervention required to deliver such coverage can be undesirable and impractical; however, endangered populations are increasingly threatened by outbreaks of infectious disease for which effective vaccines exist. As an alternative, wildlife epidemiologists could adopt a vaccination strategy that protects a population from the consequences of only the largest outbreaks of disease. Here we provide a successful example of this strategy in the Ethiopian wolf, the world's rarest canid, which persists in small subpopulations threatened by repeated outbreaks of rabies introduced by domestic dogs. On the basis of data from past outbreaks, we propose an approach that controls the spread of disease through habitat corridors between subpopulations and that requires only low vaccination coverage. This approach reduces the extent of rabies outbreaks and should significantly enhance the long-term persistence of the population. Our study shows that vaccination used to enhance metapopulation persistence through elimination of the largest outbreaks of disease requires lower coverage than the conventional objective of reducing the reproduction number of an infectious agent to less than one.
Although Drosophila is a wonderful model organism, there is one molecular arena where it lags far behind its yeast and mouse model counterparts. Reverse genetics, whereby a piece of DNA is integrated into a target gene such that the gene is disrupted or replaced, is not easy in Drosophila. As Engels explains in his provocative Perspective, this may be set to change with the description of a new method for reverse genetics in Drosophila (Rong and Golic). This new technique should ensure that Drosophila remains the darling of geneticists for many years to come.
Neurogenesis occurs in the olfactory system of the adult brain throughout life, in both invertebrates and vertebrates, but its physiological regulation is not understood. We show that the production of neuronal progenitors is stimulated in the forebrain subventricular zone of female mice during pregnancy and that this effect is mediated by the hormone prolactin. The progenitors then migrate to produce new olfactory interneurons, a process likely to be important for maternal behavior, because olfactory discrimination is critical for recognition and rearing of offspring. Neurogenesis occurs even in females that mate with sterile males. These findings imply that forebrain olfactory neurogenesis may contribute to adaptive behaviors in mating and pregnancy.
In the past few years genetic, biochemical, and cytolocalization data have implicated members of the myosin superfamily of actin-based molecular motors in a variety of cellular functions including membrane trafficking, cell movements, and signal transduction. The importance of myosins is illustrated by the identification of myosin genes as targets for disease-causing mutations. The task at hand is to decipher how the multitude of myosins function at both the molecular and cellular level-a task facilitated by our understanding of myosin structure and function in muscle.
14-3-3 proteins are crucial in a wide variety of cellular responses including cell cycle progression, DNA damage checkpoints and apoptosis. One particular 14-3-3 isoform, sigma, is a p53-responsive gene, the function of which is frequently lost in human tumours, including breast and prostate cancers as a result of either hypermethylation of the 14-3-3sigma promoter or induction of an oestrogen-responsive ubiquitin ligase that specifically targets 14-3-3sigma for proteasomal degradation. Loss of 14-3-3sigma protein occurs not only within the tumours themselves but also in the surrounding pre-dysplastic tissue (so-called field cancerization), indicating that 14-3-3sigma might have an important tumour suppressor function that becomes lost early in the process of tumour evolution. The molecular basis for the tumour suppressor function of 14-3-3sigma is unknown. Here we report a previously unknown function for 14-3-3sigma as a regulator of mitotic translation through its direct mitosis-specific binding to a variety of translation/initiation factors, including eukaryotic initiation factor 4B in a stoichiometric manner. Cells lacking 14-3-3sigma, in marked contrast to normal cells, cannot suppress cap-dependent translation and do not stimulate cap-independent translation during and immediately after mitosis. This defective switch in the mechanism of translation results in reduced mitotic-specific expression of the endogenous internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent form of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk11 (p58 PITSLRE), leading to impaired cytokinesis, loss of Polo-like kinase-1 at the midbody, and the accumulation of binucleate cells. The aberrant mitotic phenotype of 14-3-3sigma-depleted cells can be rescued by forced expression of p58 PITSLRE or by extinguishing cap-dependent translation and increasing cap-independent translation during mitosis by using rapamycin. Our findings show how aberrant mitotic translation in the absence of 14-3-3sigma impairs mitotic exit to generate binucleate cells and provides a potential explanation of how 14-3-3sigma-deficient cells may progress on the path to aneuploidy and tumorigenesis.
Analysis of cellular components at multiple levels of biological information can provide valuable functional insights. We performed multiple high-throughput measurements to study the response of Escherichia coli cells to genetic and environmental perturbations. Analysis of metabolic enzyme gene disruptants revealed unexpectedly small changes in messenger RNA and proteins for most disruptants. Overall, metabolite levels were also stable, reflecting the rerouting of fluxes in the metabolic network. In contrast, E. coli actively regulated enzyme levels to maintain a stable metabolic state in response to changes in growth rate. E. coli thus seems to use complementary strategies that result in a metabolic network robust against perturbations.
Very few of the enzymes required for eukaryotic precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing have been identified. Ribonuclease (RNase) MRP was characterized as a nuclease that cleaves mitochondrial replication primers, but it is predominantly nucleolar. Previous genetic evidence revealed that this ribonucleoprotein is required, directly or indirectly, for cleavage of the yeast pre-rRNA in vivo at site A3. Here, an in vitro processing system that accurately reproduces this cleavage is described. Biochemical purification and the use of extracts depleted of the MRP RNA demonstrate that endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-rRNA is directly mediated by RNase MRP. This establishes a role for RNase MRP in the nucleolus.
The symbiosis between fungus-growing ants and the fungi they cultivate for food has been shaped by 50 million years of coevolution. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that this long coevolutionary history includes a third symbiont lineage: specialized microfungal parasites of the ants' fungus gardens. At ancient levels, the phylogenies of the three symbionts are perfectly congruent, revealing that the ant-microbe symbiosis is the product of tripartite coevolution between the farming ants, their cultivars, and the garden parasites. At recent phylogenetic levels, coevolution has been punctuated by occasional host-switching by the parasite, thus intensifying continuous coadaptation between symbionts in a tripartite arms race.
Deficiencies in mismatch repair have been linked to a common cancer predisposition syndrome in humans, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), and a subset of sporadic cancers. Here, several mismatch repair-deficient tumor cell lines and HNPCC-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines were found to be deficient in an additional DNA repair process termed transcription-coupled repair (TCR). The TCR defect was corrected in a mutant cell line whose mismatch repair deficiency had been corrected by chromosome transfer. Thus, the connection between excision repair and mismatch repair previously described in Escherichia coli extends to humans. These results imply that deficiencies in TCR and exposure to carcinogens present in the environment may contribute to the etiology of tumors associated with genetic defects in mismatch repair.
Aging is genetically determined and environmentally modulated. In a study of longevity in the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we found that five independent P-element insertional mutations in a single gene resulted in a near doubling of the average adult life-span without a decline in fertility or physical activity. Sequence analysis revealed that the product of this gene, named Indy (for I'm not dead yet), is most closely related to a mammalian sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter-a membrane protein that transports Krebs cycle intermediates. Indy was most abundantly expressed in the fat body, midgut, and oenocytes: the principal sites of intermediary metabolism in the fly. Excision of the P element resulted in a reversion to normal life-span. These mutations may create a metabolic state that mimics caloric restriction, which has been shown to extend life-span.
Recent phylogenetic studies and fossil finds support a new view of the ancestral angiosperm. A diminutive fossil angiosperm from the Aptian of Australia has attached leaves, with intermediate pinnate-palmate, low-rank venation, and lateral axes bearing pistillate organs subtended by bracts and bracteoles that are the oldest direct evidence of flowers. A variety of data suggests a similar morphology for the ancestral angiosperm. This hypothesis explains similarities between rhizomatous to herbaceous Magnoliidae and basal monocots, scarcity of early agniosperm wood, and lack of recognition of earlier remains.
DNA analogues are currently being intensely investigated owing to their potential as gene-targeted drugs. Furthermore, their properties and interaction with DNA and RNA could provide a better understanding of the structural features of natural DNA that determine its unique chemical, biological and genetic properties. We recently designed a DNA analogue, PNA, in which the backbone is structurally homomorphous with the deoxyribose backbone and consists of N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units to which the nucleobases are attached. We showed that PNA oligomers containing solely thymine and cytosine can hybridize to complementary oligonucleotides, presumably by forming Watson-Crick-Hoogsteen (PNA)2-DNA triplexes, which are much more stable than the corresponding DNA-DNA duplexes, and bind to double-stranded DNA by strand displacement. We report here that PNA containing all four natural nucleobases hybridizes to complementary oligonucleotides obeying the Watson-Crick base-pairing rules, and thus is a true DNA mimic in terms of base-pair recognition.
The process of body prepatterning during Drosophila blastoderm formation relies on the localized activities of zygotic segmentation genes, which are controlled by asymmetrically distributed maternal determinants. The anterior determinant bicoid, a homeodomain transcription factor, forms an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient. It interacts with the maternal transcription factor hunchback to activate the anterior zygotic patterning genes, including the central gap gene Kruppel (Kr). In contrast, the posterior maternal system does not provide such a decisive transcription factor, but rather prevents the repressor hunchback from acting in the posterior half so that the gap genes giant (gt) and knirps (kni) are activated by an as yet unknown transcription factor. Here we show that caudal, a conserved homeodomain protein that forms a posterior-to-anterior concentration gradient, and the anterior determinant bicoid cooperate to form a partly redundant activator system in the posterior region of the embryo.
Metastasis is a defining feature of malignant tumors and is the most common cause of cancer-related death, yet the genetics of metastasis are poorly understood. We used exome capture coupled with massively parallel sequencing to search for metastasis-related mutations in highly metastatic uveal melanomas of the eye. Inactivating somatic mutations were identified in the gene encoding BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) on chromosome 3p21.1 in 26 of 31 (84%) metastasizing tumors, including 15 mutations causing premature protein termination and 5 affecting its ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase domain. One tumor harbored a frameshift mutation that was germline in origin, thus representing a susceptibility allele. These findings implicate loss of BAP1 in uveal melanoma metastasis and suggest that the BAP1 pathway may be a valuable therapeutic target.
Metastatic progression depends on genetic alterations intrinsic to cancer cells as well as the inflammatory microenvironment of advanced tumours. To understand how cancer cells affect the inflammatory microenvironment, we conducted a biochemical screen for macrophage-activating factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. Here we show that, among the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) through activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family members TLR2 and TLR6. Both TNF-alpha and TLR2 were found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of LLC-conditioned medium (LCM) led to identification of the extracellular matrix proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated in many human tumours including lung cancer, as a macrophage activator that acts through TLR2 and its co-receptors TLR6 and CD14. By activating TLR2:TLR6 complexes and inducing TNF-alpha secretion by myeloid cells, versican strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. These results explain how advanced cancer cells usurp components of the host innate immune system, including bone-marrow-derived myeloid progenitors, to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable for metastatic growth.
Inheritance plays a major role in behavior as shown by selection and strain studies for animal behavior and by twin and adoption studies for human behavior. Unlike simple Mendelian characteristics, genetic variance for behavioral dimensions and disorders rarely accounts for more than half of the phenotypic variance, and multiple genes with small effects appear to be involved rather than one or two major genes. Genetic research on behavior will be transformed by techniques of molecular biology that can be used to identify DNA sequences responsible for behavioral variation. However, the importance of nongenetic factors and the multigenetic control of behavior require new strategies to detect DNA markers that account for small amounts of behavioral variation.
How do animals discriminate self-generated from external stimuli during behavior and prevent desensitization of their sensory pathways? A fundamental concept in neuroscience states that neural signals, termed corollary discharges or efference copies, are forwarded from motor to sensory areas. Neurons mediating these signals have proved difficult to identify. We show that a single, multisegmental interneuron is responsible for the pre- and postsynaptic inhibition of auditory neurons in singing crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus). Therefore, this neuron represents a corollary discharge interneuron that provides a neuronal basis for the central control of sensory responses.
Global climate has fluctuated greatly during the past three million years, leading to the recent major ice ages. An inescapable consequence for most living organisms is great changes in their distribution, which are expressed differently in boreal, temperate and tropical zones. Such range changes can be expected to have genetic consequences, and the advent of DNA technology provides most suitable markers to examine these. Several good data sets are now available, which provide tests of expectations, insights into species colonization and unexpected genetic subdivision and mixture of species. The genetic structure of human populations may be viewed in the same context. The present genetic structure of populations, species and communities has been mainly formed by Quaternary ice ages, and genetic, fossil and physical data combined can greatly help our understanding of how organisms were so affected.
Technological advances have made possible the development of high-resolution genetic linkage maps for the mouse. These maps in turn offer exciting prospects for understanding mammalian genome evolution through comparative mapping, for developing mouse models of human disease, and for identifying the function of all genes in the organism.
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) facilitate nucleocytoplasmic transport. These massive assemblies comprise an eightfold symmetric scaffold of architectural proteins and central-channel phenylalanine-glycine-repeat proteins forming the transport barrier. We determined the nucleoporin 85 (Nup85)*Seh1 structure, a module in the heptameric Nup84 complex, at 3.5 angstroms resolution. Structural, biochemical, and genetic analyses position the Nup84 complex in two peripheral NPC rings. We establish a conserved tripartite element, the ancestral coatomer element ACE1, that reoccurs in several nucleoporins and vesicle coat proteins, providing structural evidence of coevolution from a common ancestor. We identified interactions that define the organization of the Nup84 complex on the basis of comparison with vesicle coats and confirmed the sites by mutagenesis. We propose that the NPC scaffold, like vesicle coats, is composed of polygons with vertices and edges forming a membrane-proximal lattice that provides docking sites for additional nucleoporins.
Human beings have been manipulating the genetic characteristics plants and animals since the introduction of agriculture indirect manipulation of human genes occurred with widespread use of public health and medical measures that preserve genes causing disease. The production of biologicals by DNA technology raises few ethical problems. Predictive medicine in which genetic markers (including DNA variants) are used for antenatal and preclinical diagnosis of genetic diseases and susceptibilities poses new questions of confidentiality, private versus societal goals, and self-determination. When normal DNA is used to treat the somatic cells of patients with hemoglobinopathies and other genetic diseases, no new ethical problems arise beyond those presented by an novel theory. In contrast, manipulation of DNA in human fertilized eggs would constitute a qualitative departure from previous therapies since this would affect future generations. In order to be able to make wise decisions on these matters the public must be well informed. Thus, formal and informal education in human biology and genetics must be improved at all levels.
Deletions in the DNA of individuals with hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin (HPFH) and 8 beta-thalassaemia have been mapped as a means of identifying regulatory sequences involved in the switch from fetal to adult globin gene expression. The end points of these deletions have been precisely located with respect to restriction endonuclease cleavage sites within and surrounding the gamma-, delta- and beta-globin genes in normal human DNA and the deletion maps were used to obtain definitive evidence for the physical linkage of the fetal and adult beta-like globin genes in the order 5'Ggamma-Agamma-delta-beta 3'. Correlation of haematological data and the location of deletions in two cases of HPFH and one case of deltabeta-thalassaemia suggest that a region of DNA located near the 5'-end of the delta-globin gene may be involved in the suppression in cis of gamma-globin gene expression in adults. The interpretation of a second case of deltabeta-thalassaemia is complicated by the fact that the deletion removes the Agamma-gene in addition to the region near the 5'-end of the delta-globin gene.
Protein kinases are enzymes that are important for controlling cellular growth and invasion, and their malfunction is implicated in the development of some tumours. We analysed human colorectal cancers for genetic mutations in 340 serine/threonine kinases and found mutations in eight genes, including in three members of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) pathway. The discovery of this mutational activation of a key cell-signalling pathway may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention.
Many spontaneous mutations are caused by the insertion or excision of DNA elements. Since most mutations are deleterious, evolution should favor a mechanism for genetically controlling the rate of movement of transposable elements in most, if not all, organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster a syndrome of correlated genetic changes, including mutation, chromosome breakage, and sterility, is observed in the hybrid progeny of crosses between different strains. This syndrome, which is termed hybrid dysgenesis, results from the movement of P-DNA elements. What is not clear is whether the movement of other types of transposable elements is under the same coordinated control. In this study the ability of hybrid dysgenesis to increase the rate of excision of 12 DNA elements at 16 mutant alleles and to induce insertion-bearing mutations to change to other mutant states was tested. The data show that hybrid dysgenesis caused by P-element transpositions does not act as a general stimulus for the movement of other Drosophila transposable elements.
Little is known of the genetic architecture of cancer at the subclonal and single-cell level or in the cells responsible for cancer clone maintenance and propagation. Here we have examined this issue in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in which the ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion is an early or initiating genetic lesion followed by a modest number of recurrent or 'driver' copy number alterations. By multiplexing fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for these mutations, up to eight genetic abnormalities can be detected in single cells, a genetic signature of subclones identified and a composite picture of subclonal architecture and putative ancestral trees assembled. Subclones in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have variegated genetics and complex, nonlinear or branching evolutionary histories. Copy number alterations are independently and reiteratively acquired in subclones of individual patients, and in no preferential order. Clonal architecture is dynamic and is subject to change in the lead-up to a diagnosis and in relapse. Leukaemia propagating cells, assayed by serial transplantation in NOD/SCID IL2Rg(null) mice, are also genetically variegated, mirroring subclonal patterns, and vary in competitive regenerative capacity in vivo. These data have implications for cancer genomics and for the targeted therapy of cancer.
Tree taxa shifted latitude or elevation range in response to changes in Quaternary climate. Because many modern trees display adaptive differentiation in relation to latitude or elevation, it is likely that ancient trees were also so differentiated, with environmental sensitivities of populations throughout the range evolving in conjunction with migrations. Rapid climate changes challenge this process by imposing stronger selection and by distancing populations from environments to which they are adapted. The unprecedented rates of climate changes anticipated to occur in the future, coupled with land use changes that impede gene flow, can be expected to disrupt the interplay of adaptation and migration, likely affecting productivity and threatening the persistence of many species.
The PTH/PTHrP receptor binds to two ligands with distinct functions: the calcium-regulating hormone, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and the paracrine factor, PTH-related protein (PTHrP). Each ligand, in turn, is likely to activate more than one receptor. The functions of the PTH/PTHrP receptor were investigated by deletion of the murine gene by homologous recombination. Most PTH/PTHrP receptor (-/-) mutant mice died in mid-gestation, a phenotype not observed in PTHrP (-/-) mice, perhaps because of the effects of maternal PTHrP. Mice that survived exhibited accelerated differentiation of chondrocytes in bone, and their bones, grown in explant culture, were resistant to the effects of PTHrP and Sonic hedgehog. These results suggest that the PTH/PTHrP receptor mediates the effects of Indian Hedgehog and PTHrP on chondrocyte differentiation.
Many bacteria and archaea contain clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) that confer resistance to invasive genetic elements. Central to this immune system is the production of CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) after transcription of the CRISPR locus. Here, we identify the endoribonuclease (Csy4) responsible for CRISPR transcript (pre-crRNA) processing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A 1.8 angstrom crystal structure of Csy4 bound to its cognate RNA reveals that Csy4 makes sequence-specific interactions in the major groove of the crRNA repeat stem-loop. Together with electrostatic contacts to the phosphate backbone, these enable Csy4 to bind selectively and cleave pre-crRNAs using phylogenetically conserved serine and histidine residues in the active site. The RNA recognition mechanism identified here explains sequence- and structure-specific processing by a large family of CRISPR-specific endoribonucleases.
Transposons have been enormously useful for genetic analysis in both Drosophila and bacteria. Mutagenic insertions constitute molecular tags that are used to rapidly clone the mutated gene. Such techniques would be especially advantageous in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, as the entire sequence of the genome has been determined. Several different types of endogenous transposons are present in C. elegans, and these can be mobilized in mutator strains (reviewed in ref. 1). Unfortunately, use of these native transposons for regulated transposition in C. elegans is limited. First, all strains contain multiple copies of these transposons and thus new insertions do not provide unique tags. Second, mutator strains tend to activate the transposition of several classes of transposons, so that the type of transposon associated with a particular mutation is not known. Here we demonstrate that the Drosophila mariner element Mos1 can be mobilized in C. elegans. First, efficient mobilization of Mos1 is possible in somatic cells. Second, heritable insertions of the transposon can be generated in the germ line. Third, genes that have been mutated by insertion can be rapidly identified using inverse polymerase chain reaction. Fourth, these insertions can subsequently be remobilized to generate deletion and frameshift mutations by imperfect excision.
The twitcher mouse is an animal model of galactosylceramidase deficiency (Krabbe's disease), a human sphingolipidosis. The effects of hematopoietic cell transplantation as potential enzyme replacement therapy were examined in the twitcher mouse. Survival in twitcher mice with transplants was significantly prolonged and was associated with gradual repair of demyelination in peripheral nerves. In contrast, there was no improvement in the neurodegenerative process in the central nervous system after transplantation. These observations indicate that cellular transplantation may effectively provide in vivo enzyme replacement for the peripheral manifestations of genetic storage diseases. Strategies to perturb the blood-brain barrier may be necessary for enzyme replacement to be therapeutic in diseases with central nervous system manifestations.
Coelacanths were discovered in the Comoros archipelago to the northwest of Madagascar in 1952. Since then, these rare, ancient fish have been found to the south off Mozambique, Madagascar and South Africa, and to the north off Kenya and Tanzania -- but it was unclear whether these are separate populations or even subspecies. Here we show that the genetic variation between individuals from these different locations is unexpectedly low. Combined with earlier results from submersible and oceanographic observations, our findings indicate that a separate African metapopulation is unlikely to have existed and that locations distant from the Comoros were probably inhabited relatively recently by either dead-end drifters or founders that originated in the Comoros.
Loss of the genetic determinant for pesticin I in Pasteurella pestis results in concomitant loss of the plague coagulase and fibrinolytic factor. The median lethal dose for mice of an isolate lacking only these activities is increased by factors of about 10(1), 10(4), and 10(7) cells when administered by the intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous routes, respectively. Virulence of the aforesaid strain can be enhanced in mice treated with 40 microg of ferrous iron. This response resembles that of Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis, a closely related species that normally lacks pesticin I.
Host defense peptides such as defensins are components of innate immunity and have retained antibiotic activity throughout evolution. Their activity is thought to be due to amphipathic structures, which enable binding and disruption of microbial cytoplasmic membranes. Contrary to this, we show that plectasin, a fungal defensin, acts by directly binding the bacterial cell-wall precursor Lipid II. A wide range of genetic and biochemical approaches identify cell-wall biosynthesis as the pathway targeted by plectasin. In vitro assays for cell-wall synthesis identified Lipid II as the specific cellular target. Consistently, binding studies confirmed the formation of an equimolar stoichiometric complex between Lipid II and plectasin. Furthermore, key residues in plectasin involved in complex formation were identified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and computational modeling.
Troodontid dinosaurs form one of the most avian-like dinosaur groups. Their phylogenetic position is hotly debated, and they have been allied with almost all principal coelurosaurian lineages. Here we report a basal troodontid dinosaur, Sinovenator changii gen. et sp. nov., from the lower Yixian Formation of China. This taxon has several features that are not found in more derived troodontids, but that occur in dromaeosaurids and avialans. The discovery of Sinovenator and the examination of character distributions along the maniraptoran lineage indicate that principal structural modifications toward avians were acquired in the early stages of maniraptoran evolution.
There has been no documented increase in childhood leukaemia following the Chernobyl accident. However, different forms of childhood leukaemia may not be equally susceptible to radiation carcinogenesis. Infant leukaemia is a distinct form associated with a specific genetic abnormality. Outside the former Soviet Union, contamination resulting from the Chernobyl accident has been highest in Greece and Austria and high also in the Scandinavian countries. All childhood leukaemia cases diagnosed throughout Greece since 1 January 1980 have been recorded. Here we report that infants exposed in utero to ionizing radiation from the Chernobyl accident had 2.6 times the incidence of leukaemia compared to unexposed children (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 5.1; P approximately 0.003), and those born to mothers residing in regions with high radioactive fallout were at higher risk of developing infant leukaemia. No significant difference in leukaemia incidence was found among children aged 12 to 47 months. Preconceptional irradiation had no demonstrable effect on leukaemia risk at any of the studied age groups.
Mass-spectrometry-based methods for relative proteome quantification have broadly affected life science research. However, important research directions, particularly those involving mathematical modelling and simulation of biological processes, also critically depend on absolutely quantitative data--that is, knowledge of the concentration of the expressed proteins as a function of cellular state. Until now, absolute protein concentration measurements of a considerable fraction of the proteome (73%) have only been derived from genetically altered Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, a technique that is not directly portable from yeast to other species. Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based strategy to determine the absolute quantity, that is, the average number of protein copies per cell in a cell population, for a large fraction of the proteome in genetically unperturbed cells. Applying the technology to the human pathogen Leptospira interrogans, a spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, we generated an absolute protein abundance scale for 83% of the mass-spectrometry-detectable proteome, from cells at different states. Taking advantage of the unique cellular dimensions of L. interrogans, we used cryo-electron tomography morphological measurements to verify, at the single-cell level, the average absolute abundance values of selected proteins determined by mass spectrometry on a population of cells. Because the strategy is relatively fast and applicable to any cell type, we expect that it will become a cornerstone of quantitative biology and systems biology.
The most common inherited bleeding disorder in man, haemophilia A, is caused by defect in factor VIII, a component in the blood coagulation pathway. The X-chromosome-linked disease almost certainly stems from a heterogeneous collection of genetic lesions. Because, without proper treatment, haemophilia can be a fatal disease, new mutations are necessary to account for its constant frequency in the population. In addition, haemophilia A displays a wide range of severity, and some 15% of haemophiliacs generate high levels of antibodies against factor VIII ('inhibitor patients'). The present work elucidates the molecular genetic basis of haemophilia in some individuals. Using the recently cloned factor VIII gene as a probe, we have identified two different nonsense point mutations in the factor VIII gene of haemophiliacs, as well as two different partial deletions of the gene. Our survey of 92 haemophiliacs indicates no firm correlation between antibody (inhibitor) production and gross gene defects.
Gibberellins control a range of growth and developmental processes in higher plants and have been widely used in the agricultural industry. By binding to a nuclear receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1), gibberellins regulate gene expression by promoting degradation of the transcriptional regulator DELLA proteins, including GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE (GAI). The precise manner in which GID1 discriminates and becomes activated by bioactive gibberellins for specific binding to DELLA proteins remains unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of a ternary complex of Arabidopsis thaliana GID1A, a bioactive gibberellin and the amino-terminal DELLA domain of GAI. In this complex, GID1A occludes gibberellin in a deep binding pocket covered by its N-terminal helical switch region, which in turn interacts with the DELLA domain containing DELLA, VHYNP and LExLE motifs. Our results establish a structural model of a plant hormone receptor that is distinct from the mechanism of the hormone perception and effector recognition of the known auxin receptors.
Microorganisms have been implicated in causing cytoplasmic incompatibility in a variety of insect species, including mosquitoes, fruitflies, beetles and wasps. The effect is typically unidirectional: incompatible crosses produce no progeny or sterile males, whereas the reciprocal crosses produce normal progeny. The parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis is one of the few species in which the cytogenetic mechanism of incompatibility is known. In this species the paternal chromosome set forms a tangled mass in a fertilized egg and is eventually lost. Here we report that cytoplasmic microorganisms are associated with complete bidirectional incompatibility between N. vitripennis and a closely related sympatric species, N. giraulti. Microorganisms can be seen in the eggs of both species. Hybrid offspring are normally not produced in crosses between the two species, but do occur after elimination of the microorganisms by antibiotic treatment. A cytogenetic and genetic study shows that bidirectional interspecific incompatibility is due to improper condensation of the paternal chromosomes. Microorganism-mediated reproductive isolation is of interest because it could provide a rapid mode of speciation. The mechanism of incompatibility in Nasonia is also of interest as a potential tool for studying chromosome imprinting and chromosome condensation.
The dominance of the diploid state in higher organisms, with haploidy generally confined to the gametic phase, has led to the perception that diploidy is favored by selection. This view is highlighted by the fact that no known female organism within the Metazoa exists exclusively (or even for a prolonged period) in a haploid state. We used fluorescence microscopy and variation at nine microsatellite loci to show that the false spider mite, Brevipalpus phoenicis, consists of haploid female parthenogens. We show that this reproductive anomaly is caused by infection by an undescribed endosymbiotic bacterium, which results in feminization of haploid genetic males.
Despite much research on immunological responses to helminth parasites, knowledge of the dynamic interplay between levels of herd immunity in humans and the rates of exposure, establishment and mortality of parasites remains limited. We describe here a simple mathematical model for the population dynamics of helminth infections which mirrors the development of a degree of acquired immunity within populations which are genetically heterogeneous with respect to immunological responsiveness. We interpret observed patterns in the age-specific intensity of infection and attempt to understand the possible effects of control measures based on chemotherapy and vaccination. Mass chemotherapy can, in some circumstances, reduce the level of herd immunity such that average worm burdens in the adult age classes rise above their precontrol levels. When certain individuals or groups are predisposed to heavy infection, selective or targeted drug treatment can have significantly greater impact than mass or random application. Conversely, model predictions suggest that effective parasite control by vaccination (if and when vaccines become available) is difficult to achieve in communities that are genetically heterogeneous in their ability to mount protective responses to infection.
Magnetic field studies by Voyager 1 have confirmed and refined certain general features of the Saturnian magnetosphere and planetary magnetic field established by Pioneer 11 in 1979. The main field of Saturn is well represented by a dipole of moment 0.21 +/- 0.005 gauss-R(s)(3) (where 1 Saturn radius, R(s), is 60,330 kilometers), tilted 0.7 degrees +/- 0.35 degrees from the rotation axis and located within 0.02 R(s) of the center of the planet. The radius of the magnetopause at the subsolar point was observed to be 23 R(s) on the average, rather than 17 R(s). Voyager 1 discovered a magnetic tail of Saturn with a diameter of approximately 80 R(s). This tail extends away from the Sun and is similar to type II comet tails and the terrestrial and Jovian magnetic tails. Data from the very close flyby at Titan (located within the Saturnian magnetosphere) at a local time of 1330, showed an absence of any substantial intrinsic satellite magnetic field. However, the results did indicate a very well developed, induced magnetosphere with a bipolar magnetic tail. The upper limit to any possible internal satellite magnetic moment is 5 x 10(21) gauss-cubic centimeter, equivalent to a 30-nanotesla equatorial surface field.
Studies correlating genetic variation to gene expression facilitate the interpretation of common human phenotypes and disease. As functional variants may be operating in a tissue-dependent manner, we performed gene expression profiling and association with genetic variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) on three cell types of 75 individuals. We detected cell type-specific genetic effects, with 69 to 80% of regulatory variants operating in a cell type-specific manner, and identified multiple expressive quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) per gene, unique or shared among cell types and positively correlated with the number of transcripts per gene. Cell type-specific eQTLs were found at larger distances from genes and at lower effect size, similar to known enhancers. These data suggest that the complete regulatory variant repertoire can only be uncovered in the context of cell-type specificity.
The evolutionary relationships among arthropods are of particular interest because the best-studied model system for ontogenetic pattern formation, the insect Drosophila, is a member of this phylum. Evolutionary inferences about the developmental mechanisms that have led to the various designs of the arthropod body plan depend on a knowledge of the phylogenetic framework of arthropod evolution. Based on morphological evidence, but also on palaeontological consideration, the sister group of the insects is believed to be found among the myriapods. Using nuclear ribosomal gene sequences for constructing a molecular phylogeny, we provide strong evidence that the crustaceans and not the myriapods should be considered to be the sister group of the insects. Moreover, the degree of sequence divergence suggests that the diversification of the myriapods occurred during the Cambrian. Our findings have general implications for the course of land colonization by the different arthropod groups, as well as for the interpretation of primitive and derived features of arthropod morphology.
Baculoviruses provide alternatives to chemicals for controlling insect pests and can be applied by spraying. Baculoviruses have a limited host range, but work relatively slowly. They are dissolved in the midgut of insect larvae to release infectious virions which enter gut epithelial cells and begin to replicate. Replication in other organs causes extensive tissue damage and eventually death. This process can take 4-5 days, but in the field may last for more than a week, allowing the larvae to feed for longer and thereby damaging the host plant. Baculovirus expression vectors expressing foreign genes, such as those for insect-specific toxins, hormones or enzymes, might alleviate this problem. We have now constructed a recombinant baculovirus derived from Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus containing an insect-specific neurotoxin from the venom of the North African (Algerian) scorpion, Androctonus australis Hector. The neurotoxin acts by causing specific modifications to the Na+ conductance of neurons, producing a presynaptic excitatory effect leading to paralysis and death; it has no effect in mice. Expression of the neurotoxin by the virus causes a reduction in the time required to kill the host insect.
Taubenberger et al. have sequenced the polymerase genes of the pandemic 'Spanish' influenza A virus of 1918, thereby completing the decoding of the genome of this virus. The authors conclude from these sequences that the virus jumped from birds to humans shortly before the start of the pandemic and that it was not derived from earlier viruses by gene shuffling, a process called reassortment. However, we believe that their evidence does not convincingly support these conclusions and that some of their results even indicate that, on the contrary, the virus evolved in mammals before the pandemic began and that it was a reassortant. In light of this alternative interpretation, we suggest that the current intense surveillance of influenza viruses should be broadened to include mammalian sources.
Removal of introns from eukaryotic nuclear messenger RNA precursors is catalysed by a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome, which consists of four small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6 snRNPs) and auxiliary protein factors. We have begun a genetic analysis of mammalian U2 snRNA by making second-site mutations in a suppressor U2 snRNA. Here we find that several mutations in the 5' end of U2 (nucleotides 3-8) are deleterious and that one of these can be rescued by compensatory base changes in the 3' end of U6 (nucleotides 92-95). The results demonstrate genetically that the base-pairing interaction between U2 (nucleotides 3-11) and U6 snRNA (nucleotides 87-95), originally proposed on the basis of psoralen photocrosslinking experiments, can influence the efficiency of mRNA splicing in mammals. The U2/U6 interaction in yeast, however, is fairly tolerant to mutation (D.J. Field and J.D. Friesen, personal communication), emphasizing the potential for facultative RNA interactions within the spliceosome.
All physical implementations of quantum bits (or qubits, the logical elements in a putative quantum computer) must overcome conflicting requirements: the qubits should be manipulable through external signals, while remaining isolated from their environment. Proposals based on quantum optics emphasize optimal isolation, while those following the solid-state route exploit the variability and scalability of nanoscale fabrication techniques. Recently, various designs using superconducting structures have been successfully tested for quantum coherent operation, however, the ultimate goal of reaching coherent evolution over thousands of elementary operations remains a formidable task. Protecting qubits from decoherence by exploiting topological stability is a qualitatively new proposal that holds promise for long decoherence times, but its physical implementation has remained unclear. Here we show how strongly correlated systems developing an isolated twofold degenerate quantum dimer liquid ground state can be used in the construction of topologically stable qubits; we discuss their implementation using Josephson junction arrays. Although the complexity of their architecture challenges the technology base available today, such topological qubits greatly benefit from their built-in fault-tolerance.
Structurally distinct sex chromosomes (X and Y) are the most familiar mode of genetic sex determination and have evolved independently in many different taxa. The evolutionary paths by which their characteristic properties may have evolved are reviewed. These properties include the failure of X and Y to recombine through much or all of their length, the genetic inertness of much of the Y chromosome, dosage compensation of the activity of X chromosomal loci, and the accumulation of repeated DNA sequences on the Y chromosome.
Of 19 adult intersex chickens examined, 17 were triploid animals with ZZW sex chromosomes. Triploid erythrocytes were about 1.5 times the size of diploid erythrocytes, and were present in amounts that were about two-thirds the number of diploid erythrocytes. Both diploid and triploid animals had similar hematocrits and hemoglobin concentrations. Triploidy is reflected in a relative increase in RNA, as well as in DNA, per erythrocyte. This, in addition to the trisomic mode of inheritance observed in several genetically distinct loci determining isoantigens, indicates that all three sets of chromosomes in the triploid animals are genetically active. Apparently, there is a homeostatic mechanism maintaining the concentration of hemoglobin for the species in spite of triploidy and its effect on erythrocyte size.
Darwin suggested that many apparently deleterious secondary sexual characters in males, such as bright colours, elaborate ornaments and conspicuous displays, evolved as a result of female choice. Darwin never tried to explain the crucial agent of selection, that females have preferences for exaggerated male traits. Rather, he took it for granted that females of many species possess a 'sense of the beautiful', akin to the aesthetic sense in humans. The question of why such preferences evolve remains a controversial issue. Here we report that mechanisms concerned with signal recognition possess inevitable biases in response that act as important agents of selection on signal form. The existence of such biases may be sufficient to explain the evolution of exaggerated male secondary sexual traits, and elaborate signals in general.
Half of the nucleotide substitutions during the evolutionary divergence of genes in animals, bacteria, and viruses are silent changes. These result from an inherent biochemical property of DNA and are fixed by genetic drift. Evolution may be viewed as a device for protecting DNA molecules from extinction.
Chromatin, the physiological template of all eukaryotic genetic information, is subject to a diverse array of posttranslational modifications that largely impinge on histone amino termini, thereby regulating access to the underlying DNA. Distinct histone amino-terminal modifications can generate synergistic or antagonistic interaction affinities for chromatin-associated proteins, which in turn dictate dynamic transitions between transcriptionally active or transcriptionally silent chromatin states. The combinatorial nature of histone amino-terminal modifications thus reveals a "histone code" that considerably extends the information potential of the genetic code. We propose that this epigenetic marking system represents a fundamental regulatory mechanism that has an impact on most, if not all, chromatin-templated processes, with far-reaching consequences for cell fate decisions and both normal and pathological development.
The SOS response aids bacterial propagation by inhibiting cell division during repair of DNA damage. We report that inactivation of the ftsI gene product, penicillin binding protein 3, by either beta-lactam antibiotics or genetic mutation induces SOS in Escherichia coli through the DpiBA two-component signal transduction system. This event, which requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA, transiently halts bacterial cell division, enabling survival to otherwise lethal antibiotic exposure. Our findings reveal defective cell wall synthesis as an unexpected initiator of the bacterial SOS response, indicate that beta-lactam antibiotics are extracellular stimuli of this response, and demonstrate a novel mechanism for mitigation of antimicrobial lethality.
Natural selection dictates that cells constantly adapt to dynamically changing environments in a context-dependent manner. Gene-regulatory networks often mediate the cellular response to perturbation, and an understanding of cellular adaptation will require experimental approaches aimed at subjecting cells to a dynamic environment that mimics their natural habitat. Here we monitor the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic gene regulation to periodic changes in the external carbon source by using a microfluidic platform that allows precise, dynamic control over environmental conditions. We show that the metabolic system acts as a low-pass filter that reliably responds to a slowly changing environment, while effectively ignoring fast fluctuations. The sensitive low-frequency response was significantly faster than in predictions arising from our computational modelling, and this discrepancy was resolved by the discovery that two key galactose transcripts possess half-lives that depend on the carbon source. Finally, to explore how induction characteristics affect frequency response, we compare two S. cerevisiae strains and show that they have the same frequency response despite having markedly different induction properties. This suggests that although certain characteristics of the complex networks may differ when probed in a static environment, the system has been optimized for a robust response to a dynamically changing environment.
The protein-mediated exchange of strands between a DNA double helix and a homologous DNA single strand involves both synapsis and branch migration, which are two important aspects of any general recombination reaction. Purified DNA-dependent ATPases from Escherichia coli (recA protein), Ustilago (rec 1 protein) and phage T4 (uvsX protein) have been shown to drive both synapsis and branch migration in vitro. The T4 gene 32 protein is a helix-destabilizing protein that greatly stimulates uvsX-protein-catalysed synapsis, and the E. coli SSB (single-strand binding) protein stimulates the analogous recA-protein-mediated reaction to a lesser degree. One suspects that several other proteins also play a role in the strand exchange process. For example, a DNA helicase could in principle accelerate branch migration rates by helping to melt the helix at the branch point. The T4 dda protein is a DNA helicase that is required to move the T4 replication fork past DNA template-bound proteins in vitro. Previously, we have shown that the dda protein binds to a column that contains immobilized T4 uvsX protein. We show here that this helicase specifically stimulates the branch migration reaction that the uvsX protein catalyses as a central part of the genetic recombination process in a T4 bacteriophage-infected cell.
The yeast [PSI+] element represents a new type of genetic inheritance, in which changes in phenotype are transmitted by a 'protein only' mechanism reminiscent of the 'protein-only' transmission of mammalian prion diseases. The underlying molecular mechanisms for both are poorly understood and it is not clear how similar they might be. Sup35, the [PSI+] protein determinant, and PrP, the mammalian prion determinant, have different functions, different cellular locations and no sequence similarity; however, each contains five imperfect oligopeptide repeats-PQGGYQQYN in Sup35 and PHGGGWGQ in PrP. Repeat expansions in PrP produce spontaneous prion diseases. Here we show that replacing the wild-type SUP35 gene with a repeat-expansion mutation induces new [PSI+] elements, the first mutation of its type among these newly described elements of inheritance. In vitro, fully denatured repeat-expansion peptides can adopt conformations rich in beta-sheets and form higher-order structures much more rapidly than wild-type peptides. Our results provide insight into the nature of the conformational changes underlying protein-based mechanisms of inheritance and suggest a link between this process and those producing neurodegenerative prion diseases in mammals.
The activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in unfertilized mouse ova and in mouse embryos at the two-cell stage is proportional to the number of X chromosomes present during oogenesis. This indicates that the enzyme is X-linked in the mouse and that inactivation of the X chromosome does not occur during oogenesis. However, the genetic dosage effect of the X chromosomes is not present after the increase in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in the late morula and the blastocyst stages. These results indicate that the X-linked enzyme lacuts is expressed sometimne after fertilization but before the morula stage.
Cutaneous malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive and frequently chemoresistant cancer, the incidence of which continues to rise. Epidemiological studies show that the major aetiological melanoma risk factor is ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation, with the highest risk associated with intermittent burning doses, especially during childhood. We have experimentally validated these epidemiological findings using the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor transgenic mouse model, which develops lesions in stages highly reminiscent of human melanoma with respect to biological, genetic and aetiological criteria, but only when irradiated as neonatal pups with UVB, not UVA. However, the mechanisms underlying UVB-initiated, neonatal-specific melanomagenesis remain largely unknown. Here we introduce a mouse model permitting fluorescence-aided melanocyte imaging and isolation following in vivo UV irradiation. We use expression profiling to show that activated neonatal skin melanocytes isolated following a melanomagenic UVB dose bear a distinct, persistent interferon response signature, including genes associated with immunoevasion. UVB-induced melanocyte activation, characterized by aberrant growth and migration, was abolished by antibody-mediated systemic blockade of interferon-g (IFN-g), but not type-I interferons. IFN-g was produced by macrophages recruited to neonatal skin by UVB-induced ligands to the chemokine receptor Ccr2. Admixed recruited skin macrophages enhanced transplanted melanoma growth by inhibiting apoptosis; notably, IFN-g blockade abolished macrophage-enhanced melanoma growth and survival. IFN-g-producing macrophages were also identified in 70% of human melanomas examined. Our data reveal an unanticipated role for IFN-g in promoting melanocytic cell survival/immunoevasion, identifying a novel candidate therapeutic target for a subset of melanoma patients.
Post-meiotic segregation of alleles, which is seen, for example, in the 5:3 distribution of alleles in the products of a single meiosis in fungi, has been thought to be due to the non-repair of heteroduplex regions formed during genetic recombination. In current models of genetic recombination, heteroduplex DNA is formed either as the primary intermediate generated by two interacting non-sister chromatids or as a short region flanking a double-stranded gap. The frequency of post-meiotic segregation differs for different alleles, and this is presumed to reflect the varying efficiencies with which different types of mismatches in the heteroduplex are repaired. To gain some insight into this process, we have now determined the nucleotide sequences of various yeast alleles with different post-meiotic segregation frequencies and compared the mismatches predicted to occur in heteroduplexes of these alleles with wild-type DNA with those repaired with varying efficiency in bacterial systems. A striking correlation is observed, with the mismatches predicted for high post-meiotic segregation frequency alleles being similar to mismatches repaired with low efficiency in bacteria. These results support the view that postmeiotic segregation frequency reflects heteroduplex repair efficiency and the contention that meiotic gene conversion is the result of the successful repair of heteroduplex mismatches.
Aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome number, has been recognized as a hallmark of human cancer for nearly a century; however, the mechanisms responsible for this abnormality have remained elusive. Here we report the identification of mutations in hCDC4 (also known as Fbw7 or Archipelago) in both human colorectal cancers and their precursor lesions. We show that genetic inactivation of hCDC4, by means of targeted disruption of the gene in karyotypically stable colorectal cancer cells, results in a striking phenotype associated with micronuclei and chromosomal instability. This phenotype can be traced to a defect in the execution of metaphase and subsequent transmission of chromosomes, and is dependent on cyclin E--a protein that is regulated by hCDC4 (refs 2-4). Our data suggest that chromosomal instability is caused by specific genetic alterations in a large fraction of human cancers and can occur before malignant conversion.
The pleiotropic lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) can act intracellularly independently of its cell surface receptors through unknown mechanisms. Sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), one of the isoenzymes that generates S1P, was associated with histone H3 and produced S1P that regulated histone acetylation. S1P specifically bound to the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and inhibited their enzymatic activity, preventing the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues within histone tails. SphK2 associated with HDAC1 and HDAC2 in repressor complexes and was selectively enriched at the promoters of the genes encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 or the transcriptional regulator c-fos, where it enhanced local histone H3 acetylation and transcription. Thus, HDACs are direct intracellular targets of S1P and link nuclear S1P to epigenetic regulation of gene expression.
Leguminous plants are able to establish a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with soil bacteria generally known as rhizobia. Metabolites exuded by the plant root activate the production of a rhizobial signal molecule, the Nod factor, which is essential for symbiotic nodule development. This lipo-chitooligosaccharide signal is active at femtomolar concentrations, and its structure is correlated with host specificity of symbiosis, suggesting the involvement of a cognate perception system in the plant host. Here we describe the cloning of a gene from Medicago sativa that is essential for Nod-factor perception in alfalfa, and by genetic analogy, in the related legumes Medicago truncatula and Pisum sativum. The identified 'nodulation receptor kinase', NORK, is predicted to function in the Nod-factor perception/transduction system (the NORK system) that initiates a signal cascade leading to nodulation. The family of 'NORK extracellular-sequence-like' (NSL) genes is broadly distributed in the plant kingdom, although their biological function has not been previously ascribed. We suggest that during the evolution of symbiosis an ancestral NSL system was co-opted for transduction of an external ligand, the rhizobial Nod factor, leading to development of the symbiotic root nodule.
Adult mammalian testis is a source of pluripotent stem cells. However, the lack of specific surface markers has hampered identification and tracking of the unrecognized subset of germ cells that gives rise to multipotent cells. Although embryonic-like cells can be derived from adult testis cultures after only several weeks in vitro, it is not known whether adult self-renewing spermatogonia in long-term culture can generate such stem cells as well. Here, we show that highly proliferative adult spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs) can be efficiently obtained by cultivation on mitotically inactivated testicular feeders containing CD34+ stromal cells. SPCs exhibit testicular repopulating activity in vivo and maintain the ability in long-term culture to give rise to multipotent adult spermatogonial-derived stem cells (MASCs). Furthermore, both SPCs and MASCs express GPR125, an orphan adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptor. In knock-in mice bearing a GPR125-beta-galactosidase (LacZ) fusion protein under control of the native Gpr125 promoter (GPR125-LacZ), expression in the testis was detected exclusively in spermatogonia and not in differentiated germ cells. Primary GPR125-LacZ SPC lines retained GPR125 expression, underwent clonal expansion, maintained the phenotype of germline stem cells, and reconstituted spermatogenesis in busulphan-treated mice. Long-term cultures of GPR125+ SPCs (GSPCs) also converted into GPR125+ MASC colonies. GPR125+ MASCs generated derivatives of the three germ layers and contributed to chimaeric embryos, with concomitant downregulation of GPR125 during differentiation into GPR125- cells. MASCs also differentiated into contractile cardiac tissue in vitro and formed functional blood vessels in vivo. Molecular bookmarking by GPR125 in the adult mouse and, ultimately, in the human testis could enrich for a population of SPCs for derivation of GPR125+ MASCs, which may be employed for genetic manipulation, tissue regeneration and revascularization of ischaemic organs.
Numerous studies of the underlying causes of ageing have been attempted by examining diseases associated with premature ageing, such as Werner's syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). HGPS is a rare genetic disorder resulting in phenotypes suggestive of accelerated ageing, including shortened stature, craniofacial disproportion, very thin skin, alopecia and osteoporosis, with death in the early teens predominantly due to atherosclerosis. However, recent reports suggest that developmental abnormalities may also be important in HGPS. Here we describe the derivation of mice carrying an autosomal recessive mutation in the lamin A gene (Lmna) encoding A-type lamins, major components of the nuclear lamina. Homozygous mice display defects consistent with HGPS, including a marked reduction in growth rate and death by 4 weeks of age. Pathologies in bone, muscle and skin are also consistent with progeria. The Lmna mutation resulted in nuclear morphology defects and decreased lifespan of homozygous fibroblasts, suggesting premature cell death. Here we present a mouse model for progeria that may elucidate mechanisms of ageing and development in certain tissue types, especially those developing from the mesenchymal cell lineage.
The human genome is rich in sequences which are structurally related to the 7SL RNA component of the signal recognition particle. The 7SL DNA sequence family consists of four 7SL genes, 500 7SL pseudogenes (which are truncated at one or both ends of the 7SL sequence) and 500,000 Alu sequences. Both 7SL genes and Alu elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and we show here that the internal 7SL promoter lies within the Alu-like part of the 7SL gene. Why then does RNA polymerase III transcribe the few 7SL genes so efficiently, while transcripts from the far more abundant Alu elements are not readily detectable? We find that a human 7SL gene and a synthetic Alu sequence derived from it are expressed 50-100-fold more efficiently in vitro than either a representative Alu element or two 7SL pseudogenes. 5' Deletion and insertion mutants of the 7SL gene demonstrate that, in conjunction with the internal promoter, the first 37 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site are essential for efficient and accurate initiation in vitro. We suggest that the genomic sequences upstream from most Alu elements and 7SL pseudogenes do not contain this element, and consequently that only a small subset of such sequences can be transcribed in vivo. This may help to explain the homogeneity of the Alu family within each mammalian genome, as well as the species-specific differences between mammalian Alu families.
Because of their distinct chemical signatures, ocean-island and mid-ocean-ridge basalts are traditionally inferred to arise from separate, isolated reservoirs in the Earth's mantle. Such mantle reservoir models, however, typically satisfy geochemical constraints, but not geophysical observations. Here we propose an alternative hypothesis that, rather than being divided into isolated reservoirs, the mantle is filtered at the 410-km-deep discontinuity. We propose that, as the ascending ambient mantle (forced up by the downward flux of subducting slabs) rises out of the high-water-solubility transition zone (between the 660 km and 410 km discontinuities) into the low-solubility upper mantle above 410 km, it undergoes dehydration-induced partial melting that filters out incompatible elements. The filtered, dry and depleted solid phase continues to rise to become the source material for mid-ocean-ridge basalts. The wet, enriched melt residue may be denser than the surrounding solid and accordingly trapped at the 410 km boundary until slab entrainment returns it to the deeper mantle. The filter could be suppressed for both mantle plumes (which therefore generate wetter and more enriched ocean-island basalts) as well as the hotter Archaean mantle (thereby allowing for early production of enriched continental crust). We propose that the transition-zone water-filter model can explain many geochemical observations while avoiding the major pitfalls of invoking isolated mantle reservoirs.
Fanconi's anaemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a high frequency of 'spontaneous' chromosomal aberrations and an increased risk of cancer. If, as seems plausible, the microscopically visible chromosomal aberrations in this disorder result from DNA or chromatin damage that would normally be repairable, the questions arise as to which step (or steps) in the repair process is deficient and whether the deficiency is intrinsic or the result of secondary factors. We report here that the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in FA lymphocyte cultures is positively related to oxygen tension and suggest that the site primarily affected by the FA mutation is in the complex system of defence (that is, protection and repair) against the genetic toxicity of oxygen.
Horizontal gene transfer--the exchange of genes across mating barriers--is recognized as a major force in bacterial evolution. However, in eukaryotes it is prevalent only in certain phagotrophic protists and limited largely to the ancient acquisition of bacterial genes. Although the human genome was initially reported to contain over 100 genes acquired during vertebrate evolution from bacteria, this claim was immediately and repeatedly rebutted. Moreover, horizontal transfer is unknown within the evolution of animals, plants and fungi except in the special context of mobile genetic elements. Here we show, however, that standard mitochondrial genes, encoding ribosomal and respiratory proteins, are subject to evolutionarily frequent horizontal transfer between distantly related flowering plants. These transfers have created a variety of genomic outcomes, including gene duplication, recapture of genes lost through transfer to the nucleus, and chimaeric, half-monocot, half-dicot genes. These results imply the existence of mechanisms for the delivery of DNA between unrelated plants, indicate that horizontal transfer is also a force in plant nuclear genomes, and are discussed in the contexts of plant molecular phylogeny and genetically modified plants.
The opioid peptide dynorphin is widely distributed in neuronal tissue of rats. By immunocytochemical methods, it was shown previously that dynorphin-like immunoreactivity is present in the posterior pituitary and the cells of the hypothalamic neurosecretory magnocellular nuclei which also are responsible for the synthesis of oxytocin, vasopressin, and their neurophysins. By using an affinity-purified antiserum to the non-enkephalin part of the dynorphin molecule it has now been demonstrated that dynorphin and vasopressin occur in the same hypothalamic cells of rats, whereas dynorphin and oxytocin occur in separate cells. Homozygous Brattleboro rats (deficient in vasopressin) have magnocellular neurons that contain dynorphin separate from oxytocin. Thus dynorphin and vasopressin, although they occur in the same cells, appear to be under separate genetic control and presumably arise from different precursors.
Many cellular functions are regulated by activation of cell-surface receptors that mobilize calcium from internal stores sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). The nature of these internal calcium stores and their localization in cells is not clear and has been a subject of debate. It was originally suggested that the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store is the endoplasmic reticulum, but a new organelle, the calciosome, identified by its possession of the calcium-binding protein, calsequestrin, and a Ca2+-ATPase-like protein of relative molecular mass 100,000 (100K), has been described as a potential Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive calcium store. Direct evidence on whether the calciosome is the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store is lacking. Using monoclonal antibodies raised against the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, we show that bovine adrenal chromaffin cells contain two Ca2+-ATPase-like proteins with distinct subcellular distributions. A 100K Ca2+-ATPase-like protein is diffusely distributed, whereas a 140K Ca2+-ATPase-like protein is restricted to a region in close proximity to the nucleus. In addition, Ins(1,4,5)P3-generating agonists result in a highly localized rise in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) initiated in a region close to the nucleus, whereas caffeine results in a rise in [Ca2+]i throughout the cytoplasm. Our results indicate that chromaffin cells possess two calcium stores with distinct Ca2+-ATPases and that the organelle with the 100K Ca2+-ATPase is not the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store.
During the past two decades, the use of DNA tests has revolutionized court proceedings in criminal and paternity cases. On the horizon is a new challenge for judges--whether to admit or compel genetic tests to confirm or predict genetic diseases and conditions in many more judicial contexts, e.g., decisions regarding culpability, sentencing, liability, causation, and damages. This Policy Forum reports on an empirical study of how judges would analyze these issues. The authors discuss the challenges these types of cases will bring to the court-room and suggest a series of questions that judges should consider in evaluating the need for genetic information in legal cases.
Primary sensory neurones in cranial and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of adult animals are generally thought to be maintained through connections with their peripheral (but not central) targets by trophic factor(s) other than nerve growth factor (NGF). Damage to the peripheral process of sensory neurones results in a dramatic response or even death of the neurones, whereas axotomy (cutting) of the central process does not initiate profound reaction in these neurones. The development and maintenance of neurones are highly dependent on a supply of trophic agents produced by targets and retrogradely transported via the peripheral process to the cell body. NGF deprivation in fetal rodents produced either by exogenously administered antibodies or by those of maternal origin, results in death of DRG and of some cranial sensory neurones. However, as chronic NGF deprivation in neonatal or adult rodents produces little or no cell death, it has been assumed that some other trophic factor(s) derived from the peripheral target sustains sensory neurones in postnatal life. By inducing NGF deprivation by autoimmunizing guinea pigs with mouse NGF and/or by cutting the central root (process) of a DRG, we demonstrate here that under certain conditions DRG neurones require NGF and centrally derived trophic support. Our results indicate that sensory neurones are maintained by the trophic support provided by both peripheral and central targets. This support is mediated by NGF and other as yet unidentified trophic factors. The relative importance of the two target fields and NGF compared with other trophic factors changes during development.
Mobile genetic elements have a crucial role in spreading antibiotic resistance genes among bacterial populations. Environmental and genetic factors that regulate conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial populations are largely unknown. Integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) are a diverse group of mobile elements that are transferred by means of cell-cell contact and integrate into the chromosome of the new host. SXT is a approximately 100-kilobase ICE derived from Vibrio cholerae that encodes genes that confer resistance to chloramphenicol, sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim and streptomycin. SXT-related elements were not detected in V. cholerae before 1993 but are now present in almost all clinical V. cholerae isolates from Asia. ICEs related to SXT are also present in several other bacterial species and encode a variety of antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes. Here we show that SetR, an SXT encoded repressor, represses the expression of activators of SXT transfer. The 'SOS response' to DNA damage alleviates this repression, increasing the expression of genes necessary for SXT transfer and hence the frequency of transfer. SOS is induced by a variety of environmental factors and antibiotics, for example ciprofloxacin, and we show that ciprofloxacin induces SXT transfer as well. Thus, we present a mechanism by which therapeutic agents can promote the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.
Autosomal trisomy in the mouse is invariably associated with fetal or early postnatal death. Hemopoietic stem cells from fetuses trisomic for chromosome 12 or 19 can be rescued by transplantation into lethally irradiated mice. These trisomic cells restore hemopoiesis, including lymphopoiesis, in the irradiated mice and establish a permanent and almost complete engraftment. There is no evidence that hemopoietic cells with trisomy 12 or 19 are cytogenetically unstable.
Cryptic variation is caused by the robustness of phenotypes to mutations. Cryptic variation has no effect on phenotypes in a given genetic or environmental background, but it can have effects after mutations or environmental change. Because evolutionary adaptation by natural selection requires phenotypic variation, phenotypically revealed cryptic genetic variation may facilitate evolutionary adaptation. This is possible if the cryptic variation happens to be pre-adapted, or "exapted", to a new environment, and is thus advantageous once revealed. However, this facilitating role for cryptic variation has not been proven, partly because most pertinent work focuses on complex phenotypes of whole organisms whose genetic basis is incompletely understood. Here we show that populations of RNA enzymes with accumulated cryptic variation adapt more rapidly to a new substrate than a population without cryptic variation. A detailed analysis of our evolving RNA populations in genotype space shows that cryptic variation allows a population to explore new genotypes that become adaptive only in a new environment. Our observations show that cryptic variation contains new genotypes pre-adapted to a changed environment. Our results highlight the positive role that robustness and epistasis can have in adaptive evolution.
Soon after its discovery 75 years ago, heterochromatin, a dense chromosomal material, was found to silence genes. But its importance in regulating gene expression was controversial. Long thought to be inert, heterochromatin is now known to give rise to small RNAs, which, by means of RNA interference, direct the modification of proteins and DNA in heterochromatic repeats and transposable elements. Heterochromatin has thus emerged as a key factor in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, chromosome behaviour and evolution.
The CCR5 gene encodes a cell surface chemokine receptor molecule that serves as the principal coreceptor, with CD4, for macrophage-tropic (R5) strains of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). Genetic association analysis of five cohorts of people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) revealed that infected individuals homozygous for a multisite haplotype of the CCR5 regulatory region containing the promoter allele, CCR5P1, progress to AIDS more rapidly than those with other CCR5 promoter genotypes, particularly in the early years after infection. Composite genetic epidemiologic analyses of genotypes bearing CCR5P1, CCR5-Delta32, CCR2-64I, and SDF1-3'A affirmed distinct regulatory influences for each gene on AIDS progression. An estimated 10 to 17 percent of patients who develop AIDS within 3.5 years of HIV-1 infection do so because they are homozygous for CCR5P1/P1, and 7 to 13 percent of all people carry this susceptible genotype. The cumulative and interactive influence of these AIDS restriction genes illustrates the multigenic nature of host factors limiting AIDS disease progression.
Nitric oxide (NO), a multifaceted bioregulatory agent and an environmental pollutant, can also cause genomic alterations. In vitro, NO deaminated deoxynucleosides, deoxynucleotides, and intact DNA at physiological pH. That similar DNA damage can also occur in vivo was tested by treating Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 with three NO-releasing compounds, including nitroglycerin. All proved mutagenic. Observed DNA sequence changes were greater than 99% C----T transitions in the hisG46 (CCC) target codon, consistent with a cytosine-deamination mechanism. Because exposure to endogenously and exogenously produced NO is extensive, this mechanism may contribute to the incidence of deamination-related genetic disease and cancer.
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) induce a cytolytic process in target cells which, like the glucocorticoid-mediated cytolysis of immature thymocytes, effects a rapid and characteristic degradation of chromosomal DNA. I have explored the possibility that these two lethal processes share a common pathway by studying the susceptibility of glucocorticoid-resistant mutants to CTL-mediated killing. Here, I report that an unusual thymoma mutant, which has normal hormone receptor activity, is resistant to both glucocorticoids and CTL. The failure to be killed by CTL is not due to an inability of this 'deathless' mutant to be recognized. Further, a single-step reversion can restore sensitivity to both glucocorticoids and CTL. The genetic locus thus identified may reveal one element of an endogenous suicide pathway that can be triggered by different effectors. Unlike complement-mediated lysis, the processes of glucocorticoid- and CTL-mediated cytolysis seem to require that target cells be active in their own death.
Genetic imprinting, found in flowering plants and placental mammals, uses DNA methylation to yield gene expression that is dependent on the parent of origin. DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) and its regulatory factor, DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein (Dnmt3L), are both required for the de novo DNA methylation of imprinted genes in mammalian germ cells. Dnmt3L interacts specifically with unmethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 through its amino-terminal PHD (plant homeodomain)-like domain. Here we show, with the use of crystallography, that the carboxy-terminal domain of human Dnmt3L interacts with the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a, demonstrating that Dnmt3L has dual functions of binding the unmethylated histone tail and activating DNA methyltransferase. The complexed C-terminal domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L showed further dimerization through Dnmt3a-Dnmt3a interaction, forming a tetrameric complex with two active sites. Substitution of key non-catalytic residues at the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3L interface or the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3a interface eliminated enzymatic activity. Molecular modelling of a DNA-Dnmt3a dimer indicated that the two active sites are separated by about one DNA helical turn. The C-terminal domain of Dnmt3a oligomerizes on DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. A periodicity in the activity of Dnmt3a on long DNA revealed a correlation of methylated CpG sites at distances of eight to ten base pairs, indicating that oligomerization leads Dnmt3a to methylate DNA in a periodic pattern. A similar periodicity is observed for the frequency of CpG sites in the differentially methylated regions of 12 maternally imprinted mouse genes. These results suggest a basis for the recognition and methylation of differentially methylated regions in imprinted genes, involving the detection of both nucleosome modification and CpG spacing.
The HO gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the endonuclease that initiates mating-type switching. To prevent inopportune switching, HO transcription is restricted to a specific period in the haploid cell cycle, which is just after, and dependent on, the start of the mitotic cell cycle. A repeated promoter element (CACGA4) (refs 7-9) and two trans-acting activators (SWI4 and SWI6) have been identified, which are responsible for the periodic and start-dependent transcription of HO. To understand further the link between start and HO transcription, the SWI6 gene has been cloned and sequenced. The SWI6 protein is similar to the protein in Schizosaccharomyces pombe that is encoded by cdc10 an essential gene specifically required at the start of the cell cycle. The similarity between the SWI6 and cdc10 products, and their common involvement with 'start', suggest that they may share a common mechanism for sensing or executing this critical control step in the cell cycle. The SWI6 and cdc10 proteins also contain two copies of a repeated motif that occurs at least five times in the cytoplasmic domain of the Notch protein of Drosophila melanogaster.
Hundreds of species of reef-building corals spawn synchronously over a few nights each year, and moonlight regulates this spawning event. However, the molecular elements underpinning the detection of moonlight remain unknown. Here we report the presence of an ancient family of blue-light-sensing photoreceptors, cryptochromes, in the reef-building coral Acropora millepora. In addition to being cryptochrome genes from one of the earliest-diverging eumetazoan phyla, cry1 and cry2 were expressed preferentially in light. Consistent with potential roles in the synchronization of fundamentally important behaviors such as mass spawning, cry2 expression increased on full moon nights versus new moon nights. Our results demonstrate phylogenetically broad roles of these ancient circadian clock-related molecules in the animal kingdom.
About 96% of the more than 4,800 living anuran species belong to the Neobatrachia or advanced frogs. Because of the extremely poor representation of these animals in the Mesozoic fossil record, hypotheses on their early evolution have to rely largely on extant taxa. Here we report the discovery of a burrowing frog from India that is noticeably distinct from known taxa in all anuran families. Phylogenetic analyses of 2.8 kilobases of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA unambiguously designate this frog as the sister taxon of Sooglossidae, a family exclusively occurring on two granitic islands of the Seychelles archipelago. Furthermore, molecular clock analyses uncover the branch leading to both taxa as an ancient split in the crown-group Neobatrachia. Our discovery discloses a lineage that may have been more diverse on Indo-Madagascar in the Cretaceous period, but now only comprises four species on the Seychelles and a sole survivor in India. Because of its very distinct morphology and an inferred origin that is earlier than several neobatrachian families, we recognize this frog as a new family.
Combined analyses of gene networks and DNA sequence variation can provide new insights into the aetiology of common diseases that may not be apparent from genome-wide association studies alone. Recent advances in rat genomics are facilitating systems-genetics approaches. Here we report the use of integrated genome-wide approaches across seven rat tissues to identify gene networks and the loci underlying their regulation. We defined an interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-driven inflammatory network (IDIN) enriched for viral response genes, which represents a molecular biomarker for macrophages and which was regulated in multiple tissues by a locus on rat chromosome 15q25. We show that Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 2 (Ebi2, also known as Gpr183), which lies at this locus and controls B lymphocyte migration, is expressed in macrophages and regulates the IDIN. The human orthologous locus on chromosome 13q32 controlled the human equivalent of the IDIN, which was conserved in monocytes. IDIN genes were more likely to associate with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D)-a macrophage-associated autoimmune disease-than randomly selected immune response genes (P = 8.85 x 10(-6)). The human locus controlling the IDIN was associated with the risk of T1D at single nucleotide polymorphism rs9585056 (P = 7.0 x 10(-10); odds ratio, 1.15), which was one of five single nucleotide polymorphisms in this region associated with EBI2 (GPR183) expression. These data implicate IRF7 network genes and their regulatory locus in the pathogenesis of T1D.
The question of whether any sexual process takes place at some stage of the life cycle of the trypanosome has often been raised and crosses between different drug-resistant strains have provided no convincing answer. Multinucleate forms of trypanosomes have been observed by electron microscopy but their significance and origin remain obscure. As part of a study aimed at examining the speciation and genetics of the Trypanosoma brucei complex of trypanosomes, a series of isolates from a population of T.b. brucei have been screened for electrophoretic variation in 19 enzymes. The results of this survey, reported here, provide strong evidence that trypanosomes are diploid and undergo random mating and recombination.
Unexplained debilitating dementia or encephalopathy occurs frequently in adults and children with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Brains from 15 individuals with AIDS and encephalopathy were examined by Southern analysis and in situ hybridization for the presence of human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type III (HTLV-III), the virus believed to be the causative agent of AIDS. HTLV-III DNA was detected in the brains of five patients, and viral-specific RNA was detected in four of these. In view of these findings and the recent demonstration of morphologic and genetic relatedness between HTLV-III and visna virus, a lentivirus that causes a chronic degenerative neurologic disease in sheep, HTLV-III should be evaluated further as a possible cause of AIDS encephalopathy.
A variety of antigens have been identified on the surface of the malignant cell. However, identical antigens are often found on non-malignant cells of the same or different histological origin, or of a different stage of embryonic development. Many of these tumour-associated antigens appear to be only incidentally expressed on neoplastic cells. Clearly, it would be of great interest to identify cell-surface antigens whose expression is associated specifically with the transformed state and linked directly with the mechanisms responsible for transformation. The detection of activated cellular oncogenes in human and animal cancer cells by the technique of DNA transfection has allowed the isolation of genetic elements which are thought to have a critical role in malignancy. Here, in an effort to identify cell-surface antigens associated with the neoplastic process, we have generated hybridomas which secrete monoclonal antibodies that react specifically with cell-surface determinants found on NIH 3T3 cells transformed by transfection with a group of rat neuroblastoma oncogenes. These antibodies bind to and immunoprecipitate a phosphoprotein of relative molecular mass 185,000 (185 K) from a DNA donor rat neuroblastoma and 13 independent rat neuroblastoma DNA transfectants. There was no antibody reactivity with normal NIH 3T3 cells or with NIH 3T3 cells transformed by various other agents.
Aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases, which catalyze the attachment of the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA during translation of the genetic code, are proven antimicrobial drug targets. We show that the broad-spectrum antifungal 5-fluoro-1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole (AN2690), in development for the treatment of onychomycosis, inhibits yeast cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase by formation of a stable tRNA(Leu)-AN2690 adduct in the editing site of the enzyme. Adduct formation is mediated through the boron atom of AN2690 and the 2'- and 3'-oxygen atoms of tRNA's3'-terminal adenosine. The trapping of enzyme-bound tRNA(Leu) in the editing site prevents catalytic turnover, thus inhibiting synthesis of leucyl-tRNA(Leu) and consequentially blocking protein synthesis. This result establishes the editing site as a bona fide target for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors.
Although single heterozygous markers in yeast usually segregate during meiosis in a 2:2 ratio, abberant 3:1 segregations occur quite frequently as a result of gene-conversion events. A second type of aberrant segregation, post-meiotic segregation, results from the segregation of two genotypes from a single haploid spore; in yeast such events are detected as sectored spore colonies and usually occur rarely. Post-meiotic segregation is thought to result from the replication of heteroduplex DNA formed during meiotic recombination. We report here that if the heteroduplex includes a palindromic insertion sequence, a high frequency of post-meiotic segregation results. This suggests that palindromic insertions are poorly repaired, which may be the result of hairpin-loop formation that affects the efficiency of repair of heteroduplex DNA.
In a study of genetic variation in the AIDS virus, HTLV-III/LAV, sequential virus isolates from persistently infected individuals were examined by Southern blot genomic analysis, molecular cloning, and nucleotide sequencing. Four to six virus isolates were obtained from each of three individuals over a 1-year or 2-year period. Changes were detected throughout the viral genomes and consisted of isolated and clustered nucleotide point mutations as well as short deletions or insertions. Results from genomic restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence comparisons indicated that viruses isolated sequentially had evolved in parallel from a common progenitor virus. The rate of evolution of HTLV-III/LAV was estimated to be at least 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the env gene and 10(-4) for the gag gene, values a millionfold greater than for most DNA genomes. Despite this relatively rapid rate of sequence divergence, virus isolates from any one patient were all much more related to each other than to viruses from other individuals. In view of the substantial heterogeneity among most independent HTLV-III/LAV isolates, the repeated isolation from a given individual of only highly related viruses raises the possibility that some type of interference mechanism may prevent simultaneous infection by more than one major genotypic form of the virus.
Behaviour is governed by activity in highly structured neural circuits. Genetically targeted sensors and switches facilitate measurement and manipulation of activity in vivo, linking activity in defined nodes of neural circuits to behaviour. Because of access to specific cell types, these molecular tools will have the largest impact in genetic model systems such as the mouse. Emerging assays of mouse behaviour are beginning to rival those of behaving monkeys in terms of stimulus and behavioural control. We predict that the confluence of new behavioural and molecular tools in the mouse will reveal the logic of complex mammalian circuits.
Since we do not know of any completely workable solutions to the problems we have considered, we shall settle for a few general observations: 1) The public availability of socially useful computer communications services is and has been held back by legal battles that are now under way between the potential suppliers. 2) No simple resolution of these issues in the near future seems likely in view of the past conceptual separation of computers and communications doctrines. 3) The current policy is to determine whether the nation shall or shall not have certain computer communications services, by the adversary process. In this process, often only the voices of the loudest adversary suppliers are heard. 4) Although there can be no certainty that better alternatives cannot be devised, we believe that such a possibility assumes a higher probability if the key actors come from the technical community sectors more representative of the future consumers. 5) If we are to have the new services that are possible, we need an approach that makes better use of the technologists' dreams and goals rather than have future prospects excessively bound by lawyers paid to preserve the interests of their clients, irrespective of any secondary consequences. 6) We cannot be sanguine about this possibility, as technological statesmanship is too easily corrupted by the same forces that have placed us in this predicament. Furthermore, even if not corrupted, beneficial cooperation can too readily be regarded as simply collusion. 7) Although we do not have any clear answer, we do know that present approaches are not taking us where we want to go very rapidly and that alternative approaches should at least be considered.
The dauer larva is an alternative larval stage in Caenorhabditis elegans which allows animals to survive through periods of low food availability. Well-fed worms live for about three weeks, but dauer larvae can live for at least two months without affecting post-dauer lifespan. Mutations in daf-2 and age-1, which produce a dauer constitutive (Daf-C) phenotype, and in clk-1, which are believed to slow metabolism, markedly increase adult lifespan. Here we show that a ctl-1 mutation reduces adult lifespan in otherwise wild-type animals and eliminates the daf-c and clk-1-mediated extension of adult lifespan. ctl-1 encodes an unusual cytosolic catalase; a second gene, ctl-2, encodes a peroxisomal catalase. ctl-1 messenger RNA is increased in dauer larvae and adults with the daf-c mutations. We suggest that the ctl-1 catalase is needed during periods of starvation, as in the dauer larva, and that its misexpression in daf-c and clk-1 adults extends lifespan. Cytosolic catalase may have evolved to protect nematodes from oxidative damage produced during prolonged dormancy before reproductive maturity, or it may represent a general mechanism for permitting organisms to cope with the metabolic changes that accompany starvation.
Nanog is a divergent homeodomain protein found in mammalian pluripotent cells and developing germ cells. Deletion of Nanog causes early embryonic lethality, whereas constitutive expression enables autonomous self-renewal of embryonic stem cells. Nanog is accordingly considered a core element of the pluripotent transcriptional network. However, here we report that Nanog fluctuates in mouse embryonic stem cells. Transient downregulation of Nanog appears to predispose cells towards differentiation but does not mark commitment. By genetic deletion we show that, although they are prone to differentiate, embryonic stem cells can self-renew indefinitely in the permanent absence of Nanog. Expanded Nanog null cells colonize embryonic germ layers and exhibit multilineage differentiation both in fetal and adult chimaeras. Although they are also recruited to the germ line, primordial germ cells lacking Nanog fail to mature on reaching the genital ridge. This defect is rescued by repair of the mutant allele. Thus Nanog is dispensible for expression of somatic pluripotency but is specifically required for formation of germ cells. Nanog therefore acts primarily in construction of inner cell mass and germ cell states rather than in the housekeeping machinery of pluripotency. We surmise that Nanog stabilizes embryonic stem cells in culture by resisting or reversing alternative gene expression states.
The origin of the domestic dog from wolves has been established, but the number of founding events, as well as where and when these occurred, is not known. To address these questions, we examined the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation among 654 domestic dogs representing all major dog populations worldwide. Although our data indicate several maternal origins from wolf, >95% of all sequences belonged to three phylogenetic groups universally represented at similar frequencies, suggesting a common origin from a single gene pool for all dog populations. A larger genetic variation in East Asia than in other regions and the pattern of phylogeographic variation suggest an East Asian origin for the domestic dog, approximately 15,000 years ago.
Polymorphisms of DNA restriction sites within the human fetal globin genes have been used to identify chromosomes that carry beta-thalassaemia genes in individuals heterozygous for this disease. This has allowed an antenatal diagnosis for beta-thalassaemia to be carried out by observation of the pattern of the inherited polymorphism of a linked DNA sequence not involved in the genetic pathogenesis of the disease. In the populations we have investigated there is no constant pattern of polymorphism that segregates with the beta-thalassaemia gene. The use of linked polymorphisms should, therefore, be applicable to antenatal diagnosis both of beta-thalassaemia and of any other single-gene defect for which there is a DNA probe specific for a sequence linked to the affected locus.
Large, homogeneously staining chromosome regions which lack the longitudinal differentiation ordinarily revealed by cytogenetic "banding" methods have been found in antifolate-resistant Chinese hamster cells and also in human neuroblastoma cells established in vitro. The drug-resistant cells are characterized by excessive production of the target enzyme, dihydrofolate reducatase, while the human neuroblastoma cells have phenotypes of normal neuronal cells. The homogeneously staining region appears to represent a novel metaphase chromosome anaomaly which may have functional significance in cells with specialized properties.
Somatostatin receptor concentrations were measured in patients with Alzheimer's disease and controls. In the frontal cortex (Brodmann areas 6, 9, and 10) and temporal cortex (Brodmann area 21), the concentrations of somatostatin in receptors in the patients were reduced to approximately 50 percent of control values. A 40 percent reduction was seen in the hippocampus, while no significant changes were found in the cingulate cortex, postcentral gyrus, temporal pole, and superior temporal gyrus. Scatchard analysis showed a reduction in receptor number rather than a change in affinity. Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in both the frontal and temporal cortex. Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was linearly related to somatostatin-receptor binding in the cortices of Alzheimer's patients. These findings may reflect degeneration of postsynaptic neurons or cortical afferents in the patients' cerebral cortices. Alternatively, decreased somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in Alzheimer's disease might indicate increased release of somatostatin and down regulation of postsynaptic receptors.
Repression of gene transcription by nuclear receptors is mediated by interactions with co-repressor proteins such as SMRT and N-CoR, which in turn recruit histone deacetylases to the chromatin. Aberrant interactions between nuclear receptors and co-repressors contribute towards acute promyelocytic leukaemia and thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. The binding of co-repressors to nuclear receptors occurs in the unliganded state, and can be stabilized by antagonists. Here we report the crystal structure of a ternary complex containing the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha ligand-binding domain bound to the antagonist GW6471 and a SMRT co-repressor motif. In this structure, the co-repressor motif adopts a three-turn alpha-helix that prevents the carboxy-terminal activation helix (AF-2) of the receptor from assuming the active conformation. Binding of the co-repressor motif is further reinforced by the antagonist, which blocks the AF-2 helix from adopting the active position. Biochemical analyses and structure-based mutagenesis indicate that this mode of co-repressor binding is highly conserved across nuclear receptors.
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a genetically heterogeneous human disease, results from a defect in nucleotide excision repair of ultraviolet-damaged DNA. XP patients are extremely sensitive to sunlight and suffer from a high incidence of skin cancers. Cell fusion studies have identified seven XP complementation groups, A-G. Group D is of particular interest as mutations in this gene can also cause Cockayne's syndrome and trichothiodystrophy. The XPD gene was initially named ERCC2 (excision repair cross complementing) as it was cloned using human DNA to complement the ultraviolet sensitivity of a rodent cell line. We have purified the XPD protein to near homogeneity and show that it possesses single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase activities. We tested whether XPD can substitute for its yeast counterpart RAD3, which is essential for excision repair and for cell viability. Expression of the XPD gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can complement the lethality defect of a mutation in the RAD3 gene, suggesting that XPD is an essential gene in humans.
Mammalian meiotic recombination, which preferentially occurs at specialized sites called hotspots, ensures the orderly segregation of meiotic chromosomes and creates genetic variation among offspring. A locus on mouse chromosome 17, which controls activation of recombination at multiple distant hotspots, has been mapped within a 181-kilobase interval, three of whose genes can be eliminated as candidates. The remaining gene, Prdm9, codes for a zinc finger containing histone H3K4 trimethylase that is expressed in early meiosis and whose deficiency results in sterility in both sexes. Mus musculus exhibits five alleles of Prdm9; human populations exhibit two predominant alleles and multiple minor alleles. The identification of Prdm9 as a protein regulating mammalian recombination hotspots initiates molecular studies of this important biological control system.
Thermophilic microbial inhabitants of active seafloor and continental hot springs populate the deepest branches of the universal phylogenetic tree, making hydrothermal ecosystems the most ancient continuously inhabited ecosystems on Earth. Geochemical consequences of hot water-rock interactions render these environments habitable and supply a diverse array of energy sources. Clues to the strategies for how life thrives in these dynamic ecosystems are beginning to be elucidated through a confluence of biogeochemistry, microbiology, ecology, molecular biology, and genomics. These efforts have the potential to reveal how ecosystems originate, the extent of the subsurface biosphere, and the driving forces of evolution.
Endoglin is a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) binding protein expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Loss-of-function mutations in the human endoglin gene ENG cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1), a disease characterized by vascular malformations. Here it is shown that by gestational day 11.5, mice lacking endoglin die from defective vascular development. However, in contrast to mice lacking TGF-beta, vasculogenesis was unaffected. Loss of endoglin caused poor vascular smooth muscle development and arrested endothelial remodeling. These results demonstrate that endoglin is essential for angiogenesis and suggest a pathogenic mechanism for HHT1.
Genomic imprinting confers a developmental asymmetry on the parental genomes, through epigenetic modifications in the germ line and embryo. These heritable modifications regulate the monoallelic activity of parental alleles resulting in their functional differences during development. Specific cis-acting regulatory elements associated with imprinted genes carry modifications involving chromatin structural changes and DNA methylation. Some of these modifications are initiated in the germ line. Comparative genomic analysis at imprinted domains is emerging as a powerful tool for the identification of conserved elements amenable to more detailed functional analysis, and for providing insight into the emergence of imprinting during the evolution of mammalian species. Genomic imprinting therefore provides a model system for the analysis of the epigenetic control of genome function.
Psychiatric genetics has been hampered by the fact that initially exciting findings from underpowered studies are so often not replicated in larger, more powerful, data sets. Here we show that the claims of Zhou et al. that neuropeptide Y (NPY) diplotype-predicted expression is correlated with trait anxiety (neuroticism) is not replicated in a data set consisting of phenotypically extreme individuals drawn from a large (n = 88,142) non-clinical population. We found no association between NPY diplotype or diplotype-predicted expression and neuroticism. Our reply to Zhou and colleagues forms part of a larger debate (see, for example, http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080709/full/454154a.html) about the efficacy and replicability of candidate driven versus genome wide approaches to psychiatric genetics.
Voltage-gated proton (H+) channels are found in many human and animal tissues and play an important role in cellular defense against acidic stress. However, a molecular identification of these unique ion conductances has so far not been achieved. A 191-amino acid protein is described that, upon heterologous expression, has properties indistinguishable from those of native H+ channels. This protein is generated through alternative splicing of messenger RNA derived from the gene NOH-1 (NADPH oxidase homolog 1, where NADPH is the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).
The microtubule cytoskeleton is essential to cell morphogenesis. Growing microtubule plus ends have emerged as dynamic regulatory sites in which specialized proteins, called plus-end-binding proteins (+TIPs), bind and regulate the proper functioning of microtubules. However, the molecular mechanism of plus-end association by +TIPs and their ability to track the growing end are not well understood. Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of a minimal plus-end tracking system consisting of the three fission yeast proteins Mal3, Tip1 and the kinesin Tea2. Using time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the EB1 homologue Mal3 has an enhanced affinity for growing microtubule end structures as opposed to the microtubule lattice. This allows it to track growing microtubule ends autonomously by an end recognition mechanism. In addition, Mal3 acts as a factor that mediates loading of the processive motor Tea2 and its cargo, the Clip170 homologue Tip1, onto the microtubule lattice. The interaction of all three proteins is required for the selective tracking of growing microtubule plus ends by both Tea2 and Tip1. Our results dissect the collective interactions of the constituents of this plus-end tracking system and show how these interactions lead to the emergence of its dynamic behaviour. We expect that such in vitro reconstitutions will also be essential for the mechanistic dissection of other plus-end tracking systems.
Ferroplasma is a genus of the Archaea, one of the three branches of the tree of life, and belongs to the order Thermoplasmatales (Euryarchaeota), which contains the most acidophilic microbes yet known. Ferroplasma species live in acid mine drainage, acidic pools and environments containing sulphidic ores such as pyrite and characterized by pH values of 0-2 and high concentrations of ferrous iron and other heavy metals. F. acidiphilum strain Y(T) is a chemoautotroph that grows optimally at pH 1.7 and gains energy by oxidizing ferrous iron and carbon by the fixation of carbon dioxide. Here we show that 86% of 189 investigated cellular proteins of F. acidiphilum are iron-metalloproteins. These include proteins with deduced structural, chaperone and catalytic roles, not described as iron-metalloproteins in any other organism so far investigated. The iron atoms in the proteins seem to organize and stabilize their three-dimensional structures, to act as 'iron rivets'. Analysis of proteins of the phylogenetic neighbour Picrophilus torridus and of the habitat neighbour Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans revealed far fewer and only typical metalloproteins. F. acidiphilum therefore has a currently unique iron-protein-dominated cellular machinery and biochemical phylogeny.
Systemic treatment of newborn rats with the catecholamine neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine alters the postnatal development of the central norepinephrine neurons. The changes are permanent and consist of denervation of distant nerve terminal projections (for example, cerebral cortex) and hyperinnervation of terminal areas close to the cell bodies (for example, cerebellum). Intracisternal injection of substance P counteracted both of these alterations. The results indicate that substance P may prevent degeneration of damaged norepinephrine neurons during ontogeny or may have a regrowth stimulatory action on these cells. Substance P might prove of use in the prevention or reduction of other types of neurodegenerative disease.
Agrobacterium is widely considered to be the only bacterial genus capable of transferring genes to plants. When suitably modified, Agrobacterium has become the most effective vector for gene transfer in plant biotechnology. However, the complexity of the patent landscape has created both real and perceived obstacles to the effective use of this technology for agricultural improvements by many public and private organizations worldwide. Here we show that several species of bacteria outside the Agrobacterium genus can be modified to mediate gene transfer to a number of diverse plants. These plant-associated symbiotic bacteria were made competent for gene transfer by acquisition of both a disarmed Ti plasmid and a suitable binary vector. This alternative to Agrobacterium-mediated technology for crop improvement, in addition to affording a versatile 'open source' platform for plant biotechnology, may lead to new uses of natural bacteria-plant interactions to achieve plant transformation.
Zonal jets are very common in nature. Well-known examples are those in the atmospheres of giant planets and the alternating jet streams found in the Earth's world ocean. Zonal flow formation in nuclear fusion devices is also well studied. A common feature of these zonal flows is that they are spontaneously generated in turbulent systems. Because the Earth's outer core is believed to be in a turbulent state, it is possible that there is zonal flow in the liquid iron of the outer core. Here we report an investigation at the current low-viscosity limit of numerical simulations of the geodynamo. We find a previously unknown convection regime of the outer core that has a dual structure comprising inner, sheet-like radial plumes and an outer, westward cylindrical zonal flow. We numerically confirm that the dual-convection structure with such a zonal flow is stable under a strong, self-generated dipole magnetic field.
In obesity and type 2 diabetes, expression of the GLUT4 glucose transporter is decreased selectively in adipocytes. Adipose-specific Glut4 (also known as Slc2a4) knockout (adipose-Glut4(-/-)) mice show insulin resistance secondarily in muscle and liver. Here we show, using DNA arrays, that expression of retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4) is elevated in adipose tissue of adipose-Glut4(-/-) mice. We show that serum RBP4 levels are elevated in insulin-resistant mice and humans with obesity and type 2 diabetes. RBP4 levels are normalized by rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing drug. Transgenic overexpression of human RBP4 or injection of recombinant RBP4 in normal mice causes insulin resistance. Conversely, genetic deletion of Rbp4 enhances insulin sensitivity. Fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid that increases urinary excretion of RBP4, normalizes serum RBP4 levels and improves insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet. Increasing serum RBP4 induces hepatic expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and impairs insulin signalling in muscle. Thus, RBP4 is an adipocyte-derived 'signal' that may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Lowering RBP4 could be a new strategy for treating type 2 diabetes.
T lymphocytes express multiple forms of the leukocyte common antigen CD45, transcribed by alternative usage of leukocyte-common antigen exons 4-6. Species-specific monoclonal antibodies against restricted epitopes (CD45R) of the antigen subdivide CD4 T cells into reciprocal subsets expressing either the high molecular weight isoforms CD45RA or RB or a molecule in which exons 4-6 have been spliced out (CD45R0). CD45R+ or RB+ CD4 T cells are potent in graft-versus-host reactions, and interleukin-2 related activities, whereas the CD45R0+ subset responds in vitro to recall antigens and provides help for antibody synthesis. It is unclear whether CD45R subsets derive from separate lineages, or are products of unidirectional or reversible differentiation. We show by transferring CD45R+ or CD45R- allotype-marked CD4 T cells into athymic nude rats that both subsets routinely generate cells of the opposite phenotype with a function that follows phenotype, not parentage. The recent equation of CD45R subsets as maturation stages representing 'naive' and 'memory' T cells is difficult to reconcile with this finding.
The genetic relationships of human populations have been studied by comparing gene frequency data for protein and blood-group loci of different populations. DNA analysis now promises to be more informative since not only do the DNA coding sequences have more variation than their corresponding proteins but, in addition, noncoding DNA sequences display more extensive polymorphism. We have now studied the frequency of a group of closely linked nuclear DNA polymorphisms (haplotypes) in the beta-globin gene cluster of normal (beta A) chromosomes of individuals from eight diverse populations. We have found that all non-African populations share a limited number of common haplotypes whereas Africans have predominantly a different haplotype not found in other populations. Genetic distance analysis based on these nuclear DNA polymorphisms indicates a major division of human populations into an African and a Eurasian group.
During its lytic cycle bacteriophage Mu uses repeated transposition as a mode of DNA synthesis. These transpositional events are undoubtedly replicative, and presumably semi-conservative. In a Mu lysogen this type of transposition can start immediately after prophage induction. However, in an infective cycle the Mu genome (which is injected into the host cell as a linear molecule flanked by short random sequences of bacterial DNA) must first become integrated into the host chromosome. Little is known about how this occurs apart from the fact that the bacterial sequences at either end of the Mu genome are lost in the process. The integration is thus similar to a transposition event. In an attempt to determine whether this type of Mu transposition (between a linear donor molecule and a circular recipient) is also semi-conservative we have analysed the progeny phage arising from an infective cycle in which the parental DNA was heterozygous for a known genetic marker. The expectation is that if integration of the infecting Mu genome occurs by a single semi-conservative transpositional event then pure phage bursts should be produced as the genetic information on only one strand would be preserved throughout the lytic cycle. The experiments reported here do not support this expectation in that the infected cells yield mixed bursts, suggesting that Mu integration is a conservative, rather than a semi-conservative event.
Indirect selection of female mating preferences may result from a genetic association between male attractiveness and offspring fitness. The offspring of attractive males may have enhanced growth, fecundity, viability or attractiveness. However, the extent to which attractive males bear genes that reduce other fitness components has remained unexplored. Here I show that sexual attractiveness in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) is heritable and genetically correlated with ornamentation. Like ornamentation, attractiveness may be substantially Y-linked. The benefit of mating with attractive males, and thus having attractive sons, is opposed by strong negative genetic correlation between attractiveness and both offspring survival and the number of sons maturing. Such correlations suggest either antagonistic pleiotropy between attractiveness and survival or linkage disequilibrium between attractive and deleterious alleles. The presence of many colour pattern genes on or near the non-recombining section of the Y chromosome may facilitate the accumulation of deleterious mutations by genetic hitchhiking. These findings show that genes enhancing sexual attractiveness may be associated with pleiotropic costs or heavy mutational loads.
A fundamental goal of cell biology is to define the functions of proteins in the context of compartments that organize them in the cellular environment. Here we describe the construction and analysis of a collection of yeast strains expressing full-length, chromosomally tagged green fluorescent protein fusion proteins. We classify these proteins, representing 75% of the yeast proteome, into 22 distinct subcellular localization categories, and provide localization information for 70% of previously unlocalized proteins. Analysis of this high-resolution, high-coverage localization data set in the context of transcriptional, genetic, and protein-protein interaction data helps reveal the logic of transcriptional co-regulation, and provides a comprehensive view of interactions within and between organelles in eukaryotic cells.
Chromosomal rearrangements are the major cause of inherited human disease and fetal loss. Translocations and loss of heterozygosity are important genetic changes causally involved in neoplasia. Chromosomal variants, such as deficiencies, are commonly exploited in genetic screens in organisms such as Drosophila because a small portion of the genome is functionally hemizygous. In the mouse, deficiencies are not generally available, thus genetic screens for recessive mutations are cumbersome. We report here that defined deficiencies, inversions and duplications extending to 3-4 cM can be constructed in embryonic stem cells. This was achieved by consecutive targeting of loxP recombination substrates to the end points of a genetic interval followed by Cre-induced recombination. This reconstructs a positive selectable marker which facilitates direct selection of clones with a chromosome structure specific to the relative orientation of the loxP sites. Duplication and deletion alleles have been transmitted into the mouse germ line. The availability of mice with defined regions of segmental haploidy will allow their use in genetic screens and enable accurate models of human 'chromosomal' diseases to be generated.
Cholinergic neurons are widespread, and pharmacological modulation of acetylcholine receptors affects numerous brain processes, but such modulation entails side effects due to limitations in specificity for receptor type and target cell. As a result, causal roles of cholinergic neurons in circuits have been unclear. We integrated optogenetics, freely moving mammalian behavior, in vivo electrophysiology, and slice physiology to probe the cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus accumbens by direct excitation or inhibition. Despite representing less than 1% of local neurons, these cholinergic cells have dominant control roles, exerting powerful modulation of circuit activity. Furthermore, these neurons could be activated by cocaine, and silencing this drug-induced activity during cocaine exposure (despite the fact that the manipulation of the cholinergic interneurons was not aversive by itself) blocked cocaine conditioning in freely moving mammals.
In an edaphically heterogeneous area in the Peruvian Amazon, clay soils and nutrient-poor white sands each harbor distinctive plant communities. To determine whether a trade-off between growth and antiherbivore defense enforces habitat specialization on these two soil types, we conducted a reciprocal transplant study of seedlings of 20 species from six genera of phylogenetically independent pairs of edaphic specialist trees and manipulated the presence of herbivores. Clay specialist species grew significantly faster than white-sand specialists in both soil types when protected from herbivores. However, when unprotected, white-sand specialists dominated in white-sand forests and clay specialists dominated in clay forests. Therefore, habitat specialization in this system results from an interaction of herbivore pressure with soil type.
Anopheles gambiae is the principal vector of malaria, a disease that afflicts more than 500 million people and causes more than 1 million deaths each year. Tenfold shotgun sequence coverage was obtained from the PEST strain of A. gambiae and assembled into scaffolds that span 278 million base pairs. A total of 91% of the genome was organized in 303 scaffolds; the largest scaffold was 23.1 million base pairs. There was substantial genetic variation within this strain, and the apparent existence of two haplotypes of approximately equal frequency ("dual haplotypes") in a substantial fraction of the genome likely reflects the outbred nature of the PEST strain. The sequence produced a conservative inference of more than 400,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms that showed a markedly bimodal density distribution. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed strong evidence for about 14,000 protein-encoding transcripts. Prominent expansions in specific families of proteins likely involved in cell adhesion and immunity were noted. An expressed sequence tag analysis of genes regulated by blood feeding provided insights into the physiological adaptations of a hematophagous insect.
Arthropods exhibit great diversity in the position, number, morphology, and function of their limbs. The evolutionary relations among limb types and among the arthropod groups that bear them (insects, crustaceans, myriapods, and chelicerates) are controversial. Here, the use of molecular probes, including an antibody to proteins encoded by arthropod and vertebrate Distal-less (Dll and Dlx) genes, provided evidence that common genetic mechanisms underlie the development of all arthropod limbs and their branches and that all arthropods derive from a common ancestor. However, differences between crustacean and insect body plans were found to correlate with differences in the deployment of particular homeotic genes and in the ways that these genes regulate limb development.
Massive microbial mats covering up to 4-meter-high carbonate buildups prosper at methane seeps in anoxic waters of the northwestern Black Sea shelf. Strong 13C depletions indicate an incorporation of methane carbon into carbonates, bulk biomass, and specific lipids. The mats mainly consist of densely aggregated archaea (phylogenetic ANME-1 cluster) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus group). If incubated in vitro, these mats perform anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction. Obviously, anaerobic microbial consortia can generate both carbonate precipitation and substantial biomass accumulation, which has implications for our understanding of carbon cycling during earlier periods of Earth's history.
A network of interacting proteins controls the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) (refs 1,2) and governs the entry of higher eukaryotic cells into S phase. Analysis of this and other genetic regulatory networks would be facilitated by intracellular reagents that recognize specific targets and inhibit specific network connections. We report here the expression of a combinatorial library of constrained 20-residue peptides displayed by the active-site loop of Escherichia coli thioredoxin, and the use of a two-hybrid system to select those that bind human Cdk2. These peptide aptamers were designed to mimic the recognition function of the complementarity-determining regions of immunoglobulins. The aptamers recognized different epitopes on the Cdk2 surface with equilibrium dissociation constant in the nanomolar range; those tested inhibited Cdk2 activity. Our results show that peptide aptamers bear some analogies with monoclonal antibodies, with the advantages that they are isolated together with their coding genes, that their small size should allow their structures to be solved, and that they are designated to function inside cells.
The ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase adds telomeric DNA onto chromosome ends and is normally regulated so that telomeric DNA lengths are kept within defined bounds. In the telomerase RNA gene from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, specific mutations that alter telomeric DNA sequences result in telomeres elongating to up to 100 times their normal length and impair cell growth. Some mutations cause immediate elongation whereas others behave like genetic time bombs, causing elongation only after a latent period of hundreds of generations.
Early in development, Drosophila embryos express the segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) in a 'zebra' pattern of active and inactive stripes, each about the width of a segment primordium. If the ftz gene is prevented from functioning, alternating portions of the body normally derived from the active stripes fail to develop, resulting in larvae which lack the denticle bands normally formed by the mesothorax and odd-numbered abdominal segments (that is, thoracic segment T2 and abdominal segments A1, A3, A5 and A7). Here, using the Drosophila heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) gene promoter to drive widespread expression of ftz transcripts on heat shock, I find that unrestricted ftz activity can cause a reciprocal 'pair-rule' phenotype--that is, the absence of the denticle bands which are normally derived from segments T1, T3, A2, A4, A6 and A8. These results show that both the 'on' and 'off' states of ftz gene expression have instructive roles in the development of alternating regions of the body, and hence suggest that the ftz gene acts combinatorially with other pair-rule genes (for example, even-skipped, odd-skipped, paired) to establish the metameric pattern of the body.
The cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) has shown promise in clinical trials for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using two mouse models, we show that the therapeutic dose of IL-10 can be reduced by localized delivery of a bacterium genetically engineered to secrete the cytokine. Intragastric administration of IL-10-secreting Lactococcus lactis caused a 50% reduction in colitis in mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium and prevented the onset of colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice. This approach may lead to better methods for cost-effective and long-term management of IBD in humans.
The microsporidia are a group of unusual, obligately parasitic protists that infect a great variety of other eukaryotes, including vertebrates, arthropods, molluscs, annelids, nematodes, cnidaria and even various ciliates, myxosporidia and gregarines. They possess a number of unusual cytological and molecular characteristics. Their nuclear division is considered to be primitive, they have no mitochondria, their ribosomes and ribosomal RNAs are reported to be of prokaryotic size and their large ribosomal subunit contains no 5.8S rRNA. The uniqueness of the microsporidia may reflect their phylogenetic position, because comparative sequence analysis shows that the small subunit rRNA of the microsporidium Vairimorpha necatrix is more unlike those of other eukaryotes than any known eukaryote 18S rRNA sequence. We conclude that the lineage leading to microsporidia branched very early from that leading to other eukaryotes.
New phylogenies were recently proposed by White and Harris, who recognized 7 genera and 16 species of fossil and extant suids from sub-Saharan Africa. This scheme is regarded here as oversimplified and an alternative is suggested, in which 9 genera and 21 species are recognized. The taxonomic and phylogenetic differences do not have any significant effect on the stratigraphic interpretations offered by White and Harris.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common recessive lethal genetic disorder, affecting 1 in 1,600 Caucasians. The disease causes defective regulation of chloride-ion transport in exocrine cells. Although in all CF families the disease is linked to a locus on chromosome 7q31, there is clinical heterogeneity in the severity of the disease and the age at which it is diagnosed. CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. A three-nucleotide deletion (delta F508) causing the loss of a phenylalanine residue in the tenth exon of the CFTR gene has been found on 70% of CF chromosomes. We have now characterized a CF family in which neither parent of the affected individual carries the common mutation, and identified a two-nucleotide insertion in the CF allele of the mother. The mutation introduces a termination codon in exon 13 of the CFTR gene at residue 821, and is predicted to result in the production of a severely truncated nonfunctional protein.
Temperature profiles measured in permafrost in northernmost Alaska usually have anomalous curvature in the upper 100 meters or so. When analyzed by heat-conduction theory, the profiles indicate a variable but widespread secular warming of the permafrost surface, generally in the range of 2 to 4 Celsius degrees during the last few decades to a century. Although details of the climatic change cannot be resolved with existing data, there is little doubt of its general magnitude and timing; alternative explanations are limited by the fact that heat transfer in cold permafrost is exclusively by conduction. Since models of greenhouse warming predict climatic change will be greatest in the Arctic and might already be in progress, it is prudent to attempt to understand the rapidly changing thermal regime in this region.
Oncogenic mutations in the serine/threonine kinase B-RAF (also known as BRAF) are found in 50-70% of malignant melanomas. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the B-RAF(V600E) mutation predicts a dependency on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade in melanoma-an observation that has been validated by the success of RAF and MEK inhibitors in clinical trials. However, clinical responses to targeted anticancer therapeutics are frequently confounded by de novo or acquired resistance. Identification of resistance mechanisms in a manner that elucidates alternative 'druggable' targets may inform effective long-term treatment strategies. Here we expressed ~600 kinase and kinase-related open reading frames (ORFs) in parallel to interrogate resistance to a selective RAF kinase inhibitor. We identified MAP3K8 (the gene encoding COT/Tpl2) as a MAPK pathway agonist that drives resistance to RAF inhibition in B-RAF(V600E) cell lines. COT activates ERK primarily through MEK-dependent mechanisms that do not require RAF signalling. Moreover, COT expression is associated with de novo resistance in B-RAF(V600E) cultured cell lines and acquired resistance in melanoma cells and tissue obtained from relapsing patients following treatment with MEK or RAF inhibitors. We further identify combinatorial MAPK pathway inhibition or targeting of COT kinase activity as possible therapeutic strategies for reducing MAPK pathway activation in this setting. Together, these results provide new insights into resistance mechanisms involving the MAPK pathway and articulate an integrative approach through which high-throughput functional screens may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
In hemolyzates from red cells of two brothers with purine overproduction and gout, activity of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase is more than twofold greater than that measured in normal or other gouty individuals. The increased enzyme activity, which is also demonstrable in fibroblasts of the one patient tested, is associated with increased production of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate by intact cells, an indication that the enzyme abnormality is the basis for the purine overproduction. This genetic abnormality is an example of an increased enzyme activity producing a disease state.
Concerted evolution is the production and maintenance of homogeneity within repeated families of DNA. Two mechanisms--unequal crossing over and biased gene conversion--have been the principal explanations of concerted evolution. Concerted evolution of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays is thought to be largely the result of unequal crossing over. However, concerted evolution of rDNA in parthenogenetic lizards of hybrid origin is strongly biased toward one of two parental sequences, which is consistent with biased gene conversion as the operative mechanism. The apparent gene conversions are independent of initial genome dosage and result in homogenization of rDNA arrays across all nucleolar organizer regions.
Recent advances in biotechnology have created many public policy and legal issues, one of the most significant of which is the treatment of biotechnological industrial products, particularly under the patent system. Patents represent one of several types of intellectual property; their ownership confers the right to exclude others from benefitting from the tangible products of a proprietary subject matter. Intellectual property law and its protections will play a major role in the rate at which biotechnology develops in the United States. In this article biotechnological intellectual property issues are reviewed in the context of their underlying legal requirements. The implications of other factors, such as international competition, research funding, and gene ownership, are also considered.
An inherited factor causing the normal sex ratio of 92 percent females to drop to about 5 percent has been produced by selective breeding in a laboratory strain of the arrhenotokous parasitic wasp Dahlbominus fuliginosus (Nees) (Hymenoptera, Eulophidae). The factor is known to be of genetic origin and is sex-limited, being transmitted by females to their sons. Its effect on the sex ratio is constant and not influenced by the female parent, the host, or the environment.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a group of childhood neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in verbal communication, impairment of social interaction, and restricted and repetitive patterns of interests and behaviour. To identify common genetic risk factors underlying ASDs, here we present the results of genome-wide association studies on a cohort of 780 families (3,101 subjects) with affected children, and a second cohort of 1,204 affected subjects and 6,491 control subjects, all of whom were of European ancestry. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms between cadherin 10 (CDH10) and cadherin 9 (CDH9)-two genes encoding neuronal cell-adhesion molecules-revealed strong association signals, with the most significant SNP being rs4307059 (P = 3.4 x 10(-8), odds ratio = 1.19). These signals were replicated in two independent cohorts, with combined P values ranging from 7.4 x 10(-8) to 2.1 x 10(-10). Our results implicate neuronal cell-adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of ASDs, and represent, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of genome-wide significant association of common variants with susceptibility to ASDs.
Old-age survival has increased substantially since 1950. Death rates decelerate with age for insects, worms, and yeast, as well as humans. This evidence of extended postreproductive survival is puzzling. Three biodemographic insights--concerning the correlation of death rates across age, individual differences in survival chances, and induced alterations in age patterns of fertility and mortality--offer clues and suggest research on the failure of complicated systems, on new demographic equations for evolutionary theory, and on fertility-longevity interactions. Nongenetic changes account for increases in human life-spans to date. Explication of these causes and the genetic license for extended survival, as well as discovery of genes and other survival attributes affecting longevity, will lead to even longer lives.
Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that affects 1% of the population. Despite intensive study, its molecular etiology remains enigmatic. Like many common diseases, schizophrenia is multifactorial in origin, with both genetic and environmental contributions likely playing an important role in the manifestation of symptoms. Recent advances based on pharmacological studies, brain imaging analyses, and genetic research are now converging on tantalizing leads that point to a central role for several neurotransmitters, including dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin, that may interface with neurodevelopmental defects reflecting disease-related genetic aberrations. Here, we provide a brief overview of the parallel approaches being used to identify the molecular causes of schizophrenia and discuss possible directions for future research.
Languages, like molecules, document evolutionary history. Darwin observed that evolutionary change in languages greatly resembled the processes of biological evolution: inheritance from a common ancestor and convergent evolution operate in both. Despite many suggestions, few attempts have been made to apply the phylogenetic methods used in biology to linguistic data. Here we report a parsimony analysis of a large language data set. We use this analysis to test competing hypotheses--the "express-train" and the "entangled-bank" models--for the colonization of the Pacific by Austronesian-speaking peoples. The parsimony analysis of a matrix of 77 Austronesian languages with 5,185 lexical items produced a single most-parsimonious tree. The express-train model was converted into an ordered geographical character and mapped onto the language tree. We found that the topology of the language tree was highly compatible with the express-train model.
In contrast with macroorganisms, whose geographical ranges are typically restricted, many microbial species appear to have cosmopolitan distributions. This observation has been explained as a consequence of ubiquitous dispersal caused by the enormous population sizes of microbial species. Recently, this "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects" theory has been challenged by the detection of considerable regional genetic variability within microbial morphospecies. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is expected under ubiquitous dispersal, evidence of regional-scale metacommunity processes can be detected in microbial morphospecies. Our results imply that the microbial and macrobial world are structured by analogous processes.
The CREM (cyclic AMP-responsive element modulator) gene encodes multiple regulators of the cAMP-transcriptional response by alternative splicing. A developmental switch in CREM expression occurs during spermatogenesis, whereby CREM function is converted from an antagonist to an activator (CREM tau; ref. 2) which accumulates to extremely high levels from the premeiotic spermatocyte stage onwards. To define the physiological mechanisms controlling the CREM developmental switch, we have hypophysectomized rats and observed the extinction of CREM tau expression in testis, thereby demonstrating a central role of the pituitary-hypothalamic axis. We then used the seasonal-dependent modulation of spermatogenesis in hamsters to dissect the hormonal programme controlling this developmental process. By this approach, combined with direct administration of pituitary-derived hormones, we have established that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is responsible for the CREM switch. FSH appears to regulate CREM expression by alternative polyadenylation, which results in a dramatic enhancement of transcript stability.
The normal sequence of molecular events which occurs during feather and skin differentiation in the chick embryo is interrupted by pituitary gland ablation. The characteristic pattern of development is reestablished in hypophysectomized embryos treated with pituitary extract and in hypophysectomized embryos in parabiotic union with their twins within a double-yolked egg. These results suggest that genetic expression in differentiating chick feather and skin after day 12 of incubation is regulated by hormones.
Heterochromatin has been defined as deeply staining chromosomal material that remains condensed in interphase, whereas euchromatin undergoes de-condensation. Heterochromatin is found near centromeres and telomeres, but interstitial sites of heterochromatin (knobs) are common in plant genomes and were first described in maize. These regions are repetitive and late-replicating. In Drosophila, heterochromatin influences gene expression, a heterochromatin phenomenon called position effect variegation. Similarities between position effect variegation in Drosophila and gene silencing in maize mediated by "controlling elements" (that is, transposable elements) led in part to the proposal that heterochromatin is composed of transposable elements, and that such elements scattered throughout the genome might regulate development. Using microarray analysis, we show that heterochromatin in Arabidopsis is determined by transposable elements and related tandem repeats, under the control of the chromatin remodelling ATPase DDM1 (Decrease in DNA Methylation 1). Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) correspond to these sequences, suggesting a role in guiding DDM1. We also show that transposable elements can regulate genes epigenetically, but only when inserted within or very close to them. This probably accounts for the regulation by DDM1 and the DNA methyltransferase MET1 of the euchromatic, imprinted gene FWA, as its promoter is provided by transposable-element-derived tandem repeats that are associated with siRNAs.
In childhood malignancies such as retinoblastoma and Wilms tumour, of which both familial and sporadic forms exist, recessive mutations of presumed differentiation genes have been implicated in tumorigenesis. A proportion of cases appear with microscopically visible chromosome deletions which indicate the regions where the genes concerned are located. Mutation or loss of one allele causes a cancer predisposition. For tumour development functional loss of the remaining normal allele is also required. In cancers with both familial and sporadic forms, molecular-genetic studies have shown that deletion is often one of the mutational events. Although familial and sporadic forms have never been distinguished in lung cancer, deletions of the short arm of chromosome 3 have been described for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), but their general occurrence in SCLC has been disputed. Using a molecular-genetic approach, we here present evidence for a consistent deletion at the chromosomal region 3p21, not only in SCLC, but in all major types of lung cancer.
The maternally transmitted antigen (Mta) is expressed on the cells of most strains of mice. It is a medial histocompatibility antigen, that is, it is recognized by unrestricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes as are major H antigens, but unlike these it is a weak transplantation antigen and does not itself restrict the T-cell recognition of minor H antigens. All other medial H antigens are encoded by genes closely linked to the major histocompatibility complex, H-2 in the mouse. By contrast, Mta appeared to follow extrachromosomal, maternal inheritance. Several substrains of NZB, NZO and non-inbred European NMRI mice are Mta-negative. Females of these strains bear only Mta- offspring, while females of the inbred Mta+ strains bear only Mta+ offspring. Repeated backcrossing from Mta+ females to NZB or NMRI males has shown that, given the right cytoplasmic genes, the chromosomal genes of these Mta- strains permit expression of Mta2. As the Mta type of a mouse cannot be influenced by embryo transfer or foster nursing, we concluded that it was determined by a cytoplasmic factor (Mtf), transmitted through the egg. We now show that a gene, Hmt, closely linked to the H-2 complex, is also required for expression of Mta.
For many species of pathogenic bacteria, invasion and survival within animal cells is central to establishing a successful host-parasite relationship. Localization within host cells protects the microorganism from host defences, or permits it to cross epithelial barriers and subsequently become systemically distributed. The precise mechanisms that permit entry of bacteria into host tissues are unclear, therefore we have been studying the invasion of epithelial cells by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. As a first step towards identifying the factors required for this process, we report here the identification of a single genetic locus from this organism that is sufficient to convert the innocuous Escherichia coli K-12 strain into an organism capable of invading cultured animal cells.
The ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase synthesizes telomeric DNA by copying an internal RNA template sequence. The telomerase activities of the yeasts Saccharomyces castellii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae--with regular and irregular telomeric sequences, respectively--have now been identified and characterized. The S. cerevisiae activity required the telomerase RNA gene TLC1 but not the EST1 gene, both of which are required for normal telomere maintenance in vivo. This activity exhibited low processivity and produced no regularly repeated products. An inherently high stalling frequency of the S. cerevisiae telomerase may account for its in vitro properties and for the irregular telomeric sequences of this yeast.
The domestication of all major crop plants occurred during a brief period in human history about 10,000 years ago. During this time, ancient agriculturalists selected seed of preferred forms and culled out seed of undesirable types to produce each subsequent generation. Consequently, favoured alleles at genes controlling traits of interest increased in frequency, ultimately reaching fixation. When selection is strong, domestication has the potential to drastically reduce genetic diversity in a crop. To understand the impact of selection during maize domestication, we examined nucleotide polymorphism in teosinte branched1, a gene involved in maize evolution. Here we show that the effects of selection were limited to the gene's regulatory region and cannot be detected in the protein-coding region. Although selection was apparently strong, high rates of recombination and a prolonged domestication period probably limited its effects. Our results help to explain why maize is such a variable crop. They also suggest that maize domestication required hundreds of years, and confirm previous evidence that maize was domesticated from Balsas teosinte of southwestern Mexico.
Brown algae (Phaeophyceae) are complex photosynthetic organisms with a very different evolutionary history to green plants, to which they are only distantly related. These seaweeds are the dominant species in rocky coastal ecosystems and they exhibit many interesting adaptations to these, often harsh, environments. Brown algae are also one of only a small number of eukaryotic lineages that have evolved complex multicellularity (Fig. 1). We report the 214 million base pair (Mbp) genome sequence of the filamentous seaweed Ectocarpus siliculosus (Dillwyn) Lyngbye, a model organism for brown algae, closely related to the kelps (Fig. 1). Genome features such as the presence of an extended set of light-harvesting and pigment biosynthesis genes and new metabolic processes such as halide metabolism help explain the ability of this organism to cope with the highly variable tidal environment. The evolution of multicellularity in this lineage is correlated with the presence of a rich array of signal transduction genes. Of particular interest is the presence of a family of receptor kinases, as the independent evolution of related molecules has been linked with the emergence of multicellularity in both the animal and green plant lineages. The Ectocarpus genome sequence represents an important step towards developing this organism as a model species, providing the possibility to combine genomic and genetic approaches to explore these and other aspects of brown algal biology further.
The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis had a profound impact on the Earth's surface chemistry, leading to a sharp rise in atmospheric oxygen between 2.45 and 2.32 billion years (Gyr) ago and the onset of extreme ice ages. The oldest widely accepted evidence for oxygenic photosynthesis has come from hydrocarbons extracted from approximately 2.7-Gyr-old shales in the Pilbara Craton, Australia, which contain traces of biomarkers (molecular fossils) indicative of eukaryotes and suggestive of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria. The soluble hydrocarbons were interpreted to be indigenous and syngenetic despite metamorphic alteration and extreme enrichment (10-20 per thousand) of (13)C relative to bulk sedimentary organic matter. Here we present micrometre-scale, in situ (13)C/(12)C measurements of pyrobitumen (thermally altered petroleum) and kerogen from these metamorphosed shales, including samples that originally yielded biomarkers. Our results show that both kerogen and pyrobitumen are strongly depleted in (13)C, indicating that indigenous petroleum is 10-20 per thousand lighter than the extracted hydrocarbons. These results are inconsistent with an indigenous origin for the biomarkers. Whatever their origin, the biomarkers must have entered the rock after peak metamorphism approximately 2.2 Gyr ago and thus do not provide evidence for the existence of eukaryotes and cyanobacteria in the Archaean eon. The oldest fossil evidence for eukaryotes and cyanobacteria therefore reverts to 1.78-1.68 Gyr ago and approximately 2.15 Gyr ago, respectively. Our results eliminate the evidence for oxygenic photosynthesis approximately 2.7 Gyr ago and exclude previous biomarker evidence for a long delay (approximately 300 million years) between the appearance of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria and the rise in atmospheric oxygen 2.45-2.32 Gyr ago.
THERE is currently much interest in the mechanism which controls the timing of cell division. Certain features of the control have been found to be common to a variety of eukaryotes. In particular, the importance of cell size as a parameter affecting cell cycle progress has been reported for mammalian cells(1,2) and for several single-celled eukaryotes(3-6). Another feature common to several systems is that growth conditions have a direct effect on the timing of division cycle events(7-9), and on cell size(9,10). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, both cell size(6) and nutritional conditions(9) have been shown to affect cycle kinetics. The organism has been used extensively as a model eukaryotic system, largely because of the ease of measuring cell size and because division occurs by binary fission(11). More recently, its genetic tractability has led to the isolation of cell division cycle (cdc) mutants(12), and also of wee mutants altered in the control coordinating growth with the division cycle(13-15). The existence of such control mutants allows a more direct approach to the investigation of the molecular basis of division control, in contrast to the indirect methods used in other systems(4,16-18). wee mutants are so far unique to S. pombe. The most conspicuous property of wee mutants is their reduced cell size(13,14). Analysis of these mutants(15,19) and other evidence(9) has shown that control over cell division timing normally acts at entry to mitosis. As the function of a number of cdc genes is specifically required for mitosis(12), interactions between wee and cdc mutants which affect mitosis might be expected. I report here that the mitotic defect caused by a defective cdc25 allele is suppressed in wee mutants. Suppression by wee1 mutants is almost complete, while the wee2.1 mutation is a less effective suppressor. The significance of these findings for genetic models of the control of mitosis is considered.
Pattern formation in the Drosophila embryo requires the concerted expression of maternal and zygotic genes. At least nineteen genes, twelve of which are maternally expressed, are involved in the establishment of dorsal-ventral polarity. Mutations in any one of these genes result in distinct alterations of cell fates and in the formation of an abnormal dorsal-ventral pattern. Mutants of the 'dorsal group', eleven of the maternal genes, have a common recessive phenotype similar to that described for dorsal, in that cells located at ventral and lateral positions assume dorsal fates and ventral structures fail to develop. Thus the dorsal group gene products may be involved in the establishment of a gradient of positional information along the dorsal-ventral axis. We have cloned snail (sna), a zygotic gene, whose expression is essential for the correct specification of dorsal-ventral pattern. In this report, we present evidence that the complementary DNA-deduced protein product of sna contains five copies of a nucleic acid-binding finger motif previously identified in two transcription factors, and in the protein product of several putative regulatory genes.
Cell lineage specification depends on both gene activation and gene silencing, and in the differentiation of T helper progenitors to Th1 or Th2 effector cells, this requires the action of two opposing transcription factors, T-bet and GATA-3. T-bet is essential for the development of Th1 cells, and GATA-3 performs an equivalent role in Th2 development. We report that T-bet represses Th2 lineage commitment through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between the two transcription factors that interferes with the binding of GATA-3 to its target DNA. These results provide a novel function for tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in specifying alternate fates of a common progenitor cell.
Population genetics has emerged as a powerful tool for unraveling human history. In addition to the study of mitochondrial and autosomal DNA, attention has recently focused on Y-chromosome variation. Ambiguities and inaccuracies in data analysis, however, pose an important obstacle to further development of the field. Here we review the methods available for genealogical inference using Y-chromosome data. Approaches can be divided into those that do and those that do not use an explicit population model in genealogical inference. We describe the strengths and weaknesses of these model-based and model-free approaches, as well as difficulties associated with the mutation process that affect both methods. In the case of genealogical inference using microsatellite loci, we use coalescent simulations to show that relatively simple generalizations of the mutation process can greatly increase the accuracy of genealogical inference. Because model-free and model-based approaches have different biases and limitations, we conclude that there is considerable benefit in the continued use of both types of approaches.
The gene encoding the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor consists of 8 exons spanning more than 25 kilobases on chromosome 10. Exons 2 and 4 were derived from a gene duplication event and unexpectedly also are homologous to the recognition domain of human complement factor B. Alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing may delete exon 4 sequences, resulting in a mRNA that does not encode a functional IL-2 receptor. Leukemic T cells infected with HTLV-I and normal activated T cells express IL-2 receptors with identical deduced protein sequences. Receptor gene transcription is initiated at two principal sites in normal activated T cells. Adult T cell leukemia cells infected with HTLV-I show activity at both of these sites, but also at a third transcription initiation site.
There is now a good theoretical understanding of life history evolution, and detailed explicit optimality models have been constructed. These present a challenge for empirical work examining some of the assumptions, such as the extent and mechanisms of the costs of growth and reproduction. In addition, there is an obvious need for comparative tests of the models. These tests, properly applied, may be particularly informative because they can deal with multiple independent variables, including ecological variables, and can reveal broad trends against a background of constraints on optima and the rate of evolutionary approach to them. Life histories are the probabilities of survival and the rates of reproduction at each age in the life-span. Reproduction is costly, so that fertility at all ages cannot simultaneously be maximized by natural selection. Allocation of reproductive effort has evolved in response to the demographic impact of different environments but is constrained by genetic variance and evolutionary history.
Crop heterogeneity is a possible solution to the vulnerability of monocultured crops to disease. Both theory and observation indicate that genetic heterogeneity provides greater disease suppression when used over large areas, though experimental data are lacking. Here we report a unique cooperation among farmers, researchers and extension personnel in Yunnan Province, China--genetically diversified rice crops were planted in all the rice fields in five townships in 1998 and ten townships in 1999. Control plots of monocultured crops allowed us to calculate the effect of diversity on the severity of rice blast, the major disease of rice. Disease-susceptible rice varieties planted in mixtures with resistant varieties had 89% greater yield and blast was 94% less severe than when they were grown in monoculture. The experiment was so successful that fungicidal sprays were no longer applied by the end of the two-year programme. Our results support the view that intraspecific crop diversification provides an ecological approach to disease control that can be highly effective over a large area and contribute to the sustainability of crop production.
Taxonomic diversification commonly occurs through adaptive radiation, the rapid evolution of a single lineage into a range of genotypes or species each adapted to a different ecological niche. Radiation size (measured as the number of new types) varies widely between phylogenetically distinct taxa and between replicate radiations within a single taxon where the ecological opportunities available seem to be identical. Here we show how variation in energy input (productivity) and environmental disturbance combine to determine the extent of diversification in a single radiating lineage of Pseudomonas fluorescens adapting to laboratory conditions. Diversity peaked at intermediate rates of both productivity and disturbance and declined towards the extremes in a manner reminiscent of well-known ecological patterns. The mechanism responsible for the decrease in diversity arises from pleiotropic fitness costs associated with niche specialization, the effects of which are modulated by gradients of productivity and disturbance. Our results indicate that ecological gradients may constrain the size of adaptive radiations, even in the presence of the strong diversifying selection associated with ecological opportunity, by decoupling evolutionary diversification from ecological coexistence.
A genetic deficiency of the fifth (C5) component of complement1-3, a serum glycoprotein of molecular weight (MW) 220,000 (ref. 4), has been found in 39% of inbred strains of mice3. Sera of deficient mice lack detectable C5 activity and protein2,3. In addition deficient mice produce antibody to mouse C5 when injected with sera from C5 sufficient (normal) strains. Levy et al.5 showed that somatic cell hybrids between C5 deficient (B10.D2/old line) macrophages and either C5 sufficient (B10.D2/new line) mouse kidney or chicken erythroblasts secreted haemolytically active mouse C5 in vitro. Several possible molecular mechanisms to account for the findings were considered, but insufficient direct data were available to choose among them. We recently reported that mouse (CD.1 strain) peritoneal cells in culture synthesise and secrete a single chain precursor, pro-C5 (MW approximately 210,000), of the two-chain (alpha chain, 125,000 and beta chain 83,000 MW) C5 protein6. Radiolabelled precursor C5 was contained within the cells and was secreted into the tissue culture media. Using similar methods, we now find that C5 deficiency in each of five different mouse strains (AKR, SWR, DBA/2J8 A/HeJ and B10.D2/old line) is due to a failure in secretion of C5 protein and not to a failure in biosynthesis of pro-C5.
The insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, is the most abundant facilitative glucose transporter in muscle and adipose tissue, the major sites for postprandial glucose disposal. To assess the role of GLUT4 in glucose homeostasis, we have disrupted the murine GLUT4 gene. Because GLUT4 has been shown to be dysregulated in pathological states such as diabetes and obesity, it was expected that genetic ablation of GLUT4 would result in abnormal glucose homeostasis. The mice deficient in GLUT4 (GLUT4-null) are growth-retarded and exhibit decreased longevity associated with cardiac hypertrophy and severely reduced adipose tissue deposits. Blood glucose levels in female GLUT4-null mice are not significantly elevated in either the fasting or fed state; in contrast, male GLUT4-null mice have moderately reduced glycaemias in the fasted state and increased glycaemias in the fed state. However, both female and male GLUT4-null mice exhibit postprandial hyperinsulinaemia, indicating possible insulin resistance. Increased expression of other glucose transporters is observed in the liver (GLUT2) and heart (GLUT1) but not skeletal muscle. Oral glucose tolerance tests show that both female and male GLUT4-null mice clear glucose as efficiently as controls, but insulin tolerance tests indicate that these mice are less sensitive to insulin action. The GLUT4-null mice demonstrate that functional GLUT4 protein is not required for maintaining nearly normal glycaemia but that GLUT4 is absolutely essential for sustained growth, normal cellular glucose and fat metabolism, and expected longevity.
The tensions between availability of materials and quality of the environment will increase with economic growth and the appreciation of environmental values. These tensions can be relieved to an extent by internalizing the costs of environmental protection so that they are reflected in the price of materials. Economic incentives and disincentives, such as effluent fees, are receiving renewed attention (5, pp. 49-51). In addition, government regulation to protect the environment will, perhaps arbitrarily, affect the availability and use of materials. The report, Man, Materials, and Environment (5, p. 25), concluded that: A national materials policy should be based upon the principle that calculations of benefits and costs associated with the extraction, transport, processing, use, and disposal of materials should take full account of the value of common property resources and of any change in the value of common properties resulting from the impact of materials on the environment; and should support the principle that those responsible for impairment of the environment should bear the costs of damage or repair. These principles should become a commonplace element of property rights, legislation, and administrative practice at all levels of government. The difficulty of measuring benefits and costs should not delay adoption of these principles but suggests the need for continuous observation and experimentation. Environmental protection regulations will result in: (i) increased costs for many materials; (ii) disruptive changes in use of materials, due to environmental characteristics and revised cost effectiveness calculations; (iii) restrictions on the siting of processing and manufacturing installations; (iv) preemption of access and surface rights to some mineral bearing lands, particularly those that are federally controlled; (v) diversion of capital from new production facilities; and (vi) frustrating delays in decisions, such as those affecting leasing and plant siting. In return for these generally undesirable disruptions in the continued development and supply of materials, society will obtain: (i) improved quality of air and water; (ii) long-term protection of the natural ecosystems of which man is a part; (iii) more efficient allocation of natural resources on the basis of more accurate and complete accounting of costs; (iv) improved human health through decreased contamination of the environment with toxic substances; and (v) conservation of materials through a closing of the production, use, and disposal cycle. Ingenuity and a more complete understanding of the parts and interactions of the energy, materials, and environment system can do much to reduce the tensions in these conflicts and bring about equitable trade-offs among societal goals.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive muscle-wasting disease that causes cardiac or respiratory failure and results in death at about 20 years of age. Replacement of the missing protein, dystrophin, using myoblast transfer in humans or viral/liposomal delivery in the mouse DMD model is inefficient and short-lived. One alternative approach to treatment would be to upregulate the closely related protein, utrophin, which might be able to compensate for the dystrophin deficiency in all relevant muscles. As a first step to this approach, we have expressed a utrophin transgene at high levels in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse. Our results indicate that high expression of the utrophin transgene in skeletal and diaphragm muscle can markedly reduce the dystrophic pathology. These data suggest that systemic upregulation of utrophin in DMD patients may lead to the development of an effective treatment for this devastating disorder.
Cardiac hypertrophy and failure are characterized by transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression. Adult cardiomyocytes in mice primarily express alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC, also known as Myh6), whereas embryonic cardiomyocytes express beta-MHC (also known as Myh7). Cardiac stress triggers adult hearts to undergo hypertrophy and a shift from alpha-MHC to fetal beta-MHC expression. Here we show that Brg1, a chromatin-remodelling protein, has a critical role in regulating cardiac growth, differentiation and gene expression. In embryos, Brg1 promotes myocyte proliferation by maintaining Bmp10 and suppressing p57(kip2) expression. It preserves fetal cardiac differentiation by interacting with histone deacetylase (HDAC) and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) to repress alpha-MHC and activate beta-MHC. In adults, Brg1 (also known as Smarca4) is turned off in cardiomyocytes. It is reactivated by cardiac stresses and forms a complex with its embryonic partners, HDAC and PARP, to induce a pathological alpha-MHC to beta-MHC shift. Preventing Brg1 re-expression decreases hypertrophy and reverses this MHC switch. BRG1 is activated in certain patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, its level correlating with disease severity and MHC changes. Our studies show that Brg1 maintains cardiomyocytes in an embryonic state, and demonstrate an epigenetic mechanism by which three classes of chromatin-modifying factors-Brg1, HDAC and PARP-cooperate to control developmental and pathological gene expression.
Vaccine protection against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in animal models is proving to be a difficult task. The difficulty is due in large part to the persistent, unrelenting nature of HIV and SIV infection once infection is initiated. SIV with a constructed deletion in the auxiliary gene nef replicates poorly in rhesus monkeys and appears to be nonpathogenic in this normally susceptible host. Rhesus monkeys vaccinated with live SIV deleted in nef were completely protected against challenge by intravenous inoculation of live, pathogenic SIV. Deletion of nef or of multiple genetic elements from HIV may provide the means for creating a safe, effective, live attenuated vaccine to protect against acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Triploid parthenogenetic lizards which are heterozygous at the lactate dehydrogenase b locus show approximately two doses of the b allele and approximately one dose of the b' allele. This finding agrees with the triploid karyotype composed of two haploid complements of chromosomes indistinguishable from those of species carrying the b allele and one complement indistinguishable from that of the species which carries the b' allele. Densitometry of electrophoretic patterns of lactate dehydrogenase from heart muscle and from kidney indicates approximately equal expression of each of the b alleles in the triploid lizards. Heterozygouis diploid lizards from the same parthenogenetic species, in agreement with their karyotype, show equal doses of b and b' alleles.
A survey of the literature of the past 50 years reveals remarkable consistency in the accumulated data relating mental functioning to genetic potentials. Intragroup resemblance in intellectual abilities increases in proportion to the degree genetic relationship.
Speaking and singing present the auditory system of the caller with two fundamental problems: discriminating between self-generated and external auditory signals and preventing desensitization. In humans and many other vertebrates, auditory neurons in the brain are inhibited during vocalization but little is known about the nature of the inhibition. Here we show, using intracellular recordings of auditory neurons in the singing cricket, that presynaptic inhibition of auditory afferents and postsynaptic inhibition of an identified auditory interneuron occur in phase with the song pattern. Presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition persist in a fictively singing, isolated cricket central nervous system and are therefore the result of a corollary discharge from the singing motor network. Mimicking inhibition in the interneuron by injecting hyperpolarizing current suppresses its spiking response to a 100-dB sound pressure level (SPL) acoustic stimulus and maintains its response to subsequent, quieter stimuli. Inhibition by the corollary discharge reduces the neural response to self-generated sound and protects the cricket's auditory pathway from self-induced desensitization.
A genetic antigen, Gm(n), has been described for the Ne subgroup of gamma-globulin previously devoid of Gm factors. It was detected by precipitin tests with a primate antiserum to Ne-type heavy chains. A relation to the Gm(b) antigens of the Vi subgroup and the Gm(f) and Gm(y) antigens of the We subgroup was apparent. The availablity of genetic antigens for the heavy chains of three subgroups of gamma-globulin with varying relationships in different populations offers an approach to the mapping of the genes concerned.
Ecological interactions are crucial to understanding both the ecology and the evolution of organisms. Because the phenotypic traits regulating species interactions are largely a legacy of their ancestors, it is widely assumed that ecological interactions are phylogenetically conserved, with closely related species interacting with similar partners. However, the existing empirical evidence is inadequate to appropriately evaluate the hypothesis of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological interactions, because it is both ecologically and taxonomically biased. In fact, most studies on the evolution of ecological interactions have focused on specialized organisms, such as some parasites or insect herbivores, belonging to a limited subset of the overall tree of life. Here we study the evolution of host use in a large and diverse group of interactions comprising both specialist and generalist acellular, unicellular and multicellular organisms. We show that, as previously found for specialized interactions, generalized interactions can be evolutionarily conserved. Significant phylogenetic conservatism of interaction patterns was equally likely to occur in symbiotic and non-symbiotic interactions, as well as in mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Host-use differentiation among species was higher in phylogenetically conserved clades, irrespective of their generalization degree and taxonomic position within the tree of life. Our findings strongly suggest a shared pattern in the organization of biological systems through evolutionary time, mediated by marked conservatism of ecological interactions among taxa.
Decorin is a small chondroitin-dermatan sulphate proteoglycan consisting of a core protein and a single glycosaminoglycan chain. Eighty per cent of the core protein consists of 10 repeats of a leucin-rich sequence of 24 amino acids. Similar repeats have been found in two other proteoglycans, biglycan and fibromodulin, and in several other proteins including Drosophila morphogenetic proteins. Expression of high levels of decorin in Chinese hamster ovary cells has a dramatic effect on their morphology and growth properties. We now report that this effect is due at least in part to the ability of decorin to bind transforming growth factor-beta, an autocrine factor that stimulates the growth of Chinese hamster ovary cells. As transforming growth factor-beta induces synthesis of decorin in many cell types, our results suggest that decorin may be a component of a feedback system regulating cell growth.
The chordates, hemichordates (such as acorn worms) and echinoderms (such as starfish) comprise the group Deuterostomia, well established as monophyletic. Among extant deuterostomes, a skeleton in which each plate has the crystallographic structure of a single crystal of calcite is characteristic of echinoderms and is always associated with radial symmetry and never with gill slits. Among fossils, however, such a skeleton sometimes occurs without radial symmetry. This is true of Jaekelocarpus oklahomensis, from the Upper Carboniferous of Oklahoma, USA, which, being externally almost bilaterally symmetrical, is traditionally placed in the group Mitrata (Ordovician to Carboniferous periods, 530-280 million years ago), by contrast with the bizarrely asymmetrical Cornuta (Cambrian to Ordovician periods, 540 to 440 million years ago). Using computer X-ray microtomography, we describe the anatomy of Jaekelocarpus in greater detail than formerly possible, reveal evidence of paired gill slits internally and interpret its functional anatomy. On this basis we suggest its phylogenetic position within the deuterostomes.
Through the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes after host immunodepletion, it is possible to mediate objective cancer regression in human patients with metastatic melanoma. However, the generation of tumor-specific T cells in this mode of immunotherapy is often limiting. Here we report the ability to specifically confer tumor recognition by autologous lymphocytes from peripheral blood by using a retrovirus that encodes a T cell receptor. Adoptive transfer of these transduced cells in 15 patients resulted in durable engraftment at levels exceeding 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes for at least 2 months after the infusion. We observed high sustained levels of circulating, engineered cells at 1 year after infusion in two patients who both demonstrated objective regression of metastatic melanoma lesions. This study suggests the therapeutic potential of genetically engineered cells for the biologic therapy of cancer.
Bone morphogenetic protein and bone-derived growth factors are biochemical tools for research on induced cell differentiation and local mechanisms controlling cell proliferation. Bone morphogenetic protein irreversibly induces differentiation of perivascular mesenchymal-type cells into osteoprogenitor cells. Bone-derived growth factors are secreted by and for osteoprogenitor cells and stimulate DNA synthesis. Bone generation and regeneration are attributable to the co-efficiency of bone morphogenetic protein and bone-derived growth factors.
Many plant pathogens, including those in the lineage of the Irish potato famine organism Phytophthora infestans, evolve by host jumps followed by specialization. However, how host jumps affect genome evolution remains largely unknown. To determine the patterns of sequence variation in the P. infestans lineage, we resequenced six genomes of four sister species. This revealed uneven evolutionary rates across genomes with genes in repeat-rich regions showing higher rates of structural polymorphisms and positive selection. These loci are enriched in genes induced in planta, implicating host adaptation in genome evolution. Unexpectedly, genes involved in epigenetic processes formed another class of rapidly evolving residents of the gene-sparse regions. These results demonstrate that dynamic repeat-rich genome compartments underpin accelerated gene evolution following host jumps in this pathogen lineage.
A full understanding of primate morphological and genomic evolution requires the identification of their closest living relative. In order to resolve the ancestral relationships among primates and their closest relatives, we searched multispecies genome alignments for phylogenetically informative rare genomic changes within the superordinal group Euarchonta, which includes the orders Primates, Dermoptera (colugos), and Scandentia (treeshrews). We also constructed phylogenetic trees from 14 kilobases of nuclear genes for representatives from most major primate lineages, both extant colugos, and multiple treeshrews, including the pentail treeshrew, Ptilocercus lowii, the only living member of the family Ptilocercidae. A relaxed molecular clock analysis including Ptilocercus suggests that treeshrews arose approximately 63 million years ago. Our data show that colugos are the closest living relatives of primates and indicate that their divergence occurred in the Cretaceous.
Lake Malawi in East Africa harbours 500-1,000 endemic species of cichlid fishes, all presumably derived by adaptive radiation from a single founding population within the past two million years. The species of this 'flock' differ strikingly in their ecology and behaviour, moderately in their external morphology and very little in their molecular characteristics. Here we describe high sequence variability of class II major histocompatibility complex genes in a sample of species from Lake Malawi. The variability provides a set of molecular markers for studying adaptive radiation and should be useful for estimating the size of the population that founded the species flock.
A detailed description of the interactions between an antibody and its epitope is necessary to allow an understanding of the way in which antibodies bind to antigenic surfaces presented by foreign molecules. Ideally this should be done by analysis of crystal structures of antibody-antigen complexes, but so far only two of these are available. An alternative strategy combines molecular modelling with site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) and using this we have generated a preliminary model of the complex between Gloop2, an antibody raised against a peptide containing the 'loop' determinant of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) which also binds the native protein, and its epitope on the protein surface. The main predictions from our model were; (1) that the surface of interaction between the antibody and the antigen is large (20 A X 15 A) and involves all the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), (2) that electrostatic interactions were important in the formation of the complex, and (3) that conformational changes in either the loop or in the CDRs may occur during the formation of the complex. Here we report SDM studies which test some of these predictions; removal of two charged residues at the periphery of the combining site increases the affinity of the antibody for its antigen over 8-fold and decreases its ability to cross-react with closely-related antigens. This result is at variance with our original prediction but can be accommodated within our newly refined model; the role of electrostatics in antigen-antibody interactions is now questionable.
Proto-daphniphylline, the imputed biogenetic parent of the Daphniphyllum alkaloids, has been assembled in a biogenetically styled laboratory synthesis in which a pentacyclization process is the fundamental synthetic stratagem. This extraordinary transformation involves the formation of six (r-bonds under the influence of three elementary reagents-potassium hydroxide, anmnonia, and acetic acid. The facility of the process adds credibility to the previous speculation that a similar process is an important step in the biosynthesis of the Daphniphyllum alkaloids.
Variation in quantitative characters underlies much adaptive evolution and provides the basis for selective improvement of domestic species, yet the genetic nature of quantitative variation is poorly understood. Many loci affecting quantitative traits have been identified by the segregation of mutant alleles with major qualitative effects. These alleles may represent an extreme of a continuum of allelic effects, and most quantitative variation could result from the segregation of alleles with subtle effects at loci identified by alleles with major effects. The achaete-scute complex in Drosophila melanogaster plays a central part in bristle development and has been characterized at the molecular level. The hypothesis that naturally occurring quantitative variation in bristle number could be associated with wild-type alleles of achaete-scute was tested by correlating phenotypic variation in bristle number with molecular variation in restriction maps in this region among chromosomes extracted from natural populations. DNA insertion variation in the achaete-scute region was found to be strongly associated with variation in bristle number.
Splenic lymphocytes of C3H/HeJ mice are defective in responding to the mitogenic activity of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which has been attributed to a mutation at a single gene locus on chromosome 4 (ref. 5). It was suggested that C3H/HeJ mice lack a cell-surface receptor necessary for LPS recognition. However, specific binding of 125I-labelled lipid-A of LPS to B cells was found to be equivalent in LPS-responder and LPS-nonresponder C3H/HeJ, C57BL/10 ScCR and C57BL/10 ScN mice. This suggests that the genetic defect in C3H/HeJ mice is related to triggering mechanisms rather than to LPS binding. We recently established a method for separating mouse splenic lymphocytes into karyoplasts (minicells) and cytoplasts (enucleated cells) with high purity. This method makes possible the exchange of nuclei from one type of lymphocyte to another. In the present study, karyoplasts were purified from LPS-nonresponder C3H/HeJ mice and transferred to mitomycin C-treated or X ray-irradiated splenic lymphocytes taken from LPS-responder C3H/HeN mice by fusion with polyethyleneglycol. These reconstituted hybrid cells could respond to LPS, suggesting that nuclei from C3H/HeJ mice could be activated by LPS if proper signals were provided from cell-surface receptors. Moreover, responsiveness to concanavalin A (Con A) of mitomycin C-treated or X ray-irradiated lymphocytes was also recovered by the microinjection of karyoplasts from untreated lymphocytes.
Epistatic interactions have an important role in phenotypic variability, yet the genetic dissection of such phenomena remains challenging. Here we report the identification of a novel locus, MGC1203, that contributes epistatic alleles to Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a pleiotropic, oligogenic disorder. MGC1203 encodes a pericentriolar protein that interacts and colocalizes with the BBS proteins. Sequencing of two independent BBS cohorts revealed a significant enrichment of a heterozygous C430T mutation in patients, and a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) showed strong over-transmission of this variant. Further analyses showed that the 430T allele enhances the use of a cryptic splice acceptor site, causing the introduction of a premature termination codon (PTC) and the reduction of steady-state MGC1203 messenger RNA levels. Finally, recapitulation of the human genotypes in zebrafish shows that modest suppression of mgc1203 exerts an epistatic effect on the developmental phenotype of BBS morphants. Our data demonstrate how the combined use of biochemical, genetic and in vivo tools can facilitate the dissection of epistatic phenomena, and enhance our appreciation of the genetic basis of phenotypic variability.
MicroRNAs are small RNA species involved in biological control at multiple levels. Using genetic deletion and transgenic approaches, we show that the evolutionarily conserved microRNA-155 (miR-155) has an important role in the mammalian immune system, specifically in regulating T helper cell differentiation and the germinal center reaction to produce an optimal T cell-dependent antibody response. miR-155 exerts this control, at least in part, by regulating cytokine production. These results also suggest that individual microRNAs can exert critical control over mammalian differentiation processes in vivo.
The past two decades of the twentieth century have been very 'rocky' for the oil industry, as shown by the overall negative perception of the oil companies by the general public. Fluctuating oil prices, many rounds of staff redundancies, environmental disasters and budget cuts supported the overall image of the oil industry as being 'the technology impaired and environmentally insensible giant'. But advances and positive changes have been quietly happening in most of the oil companies. In the twenty-first century, we will witness the metamorphosis of the oil and gas companies into energy businesses - the era of cleaner and safer oil and gas production, and alternative energy resources such as wind, solar and hydrogen is already underway.
Meiosis generates haploid gametes from diploid cells and is an almost universal feature of eukaryotic organisms. But little is known about how the switch from mitotic to meiotic cell cycles is molecularly controlled. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, inactivation of the protein kinase Pat1(Ran1) upon nutrient deprivation triggers entry into the meiotic cell cycle. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein Mei2 is a substrate of Pat1 kinase and that dephosphorylation of Mei2 is sufficient to switch cells from the mitotic cell cycle into meiosis. Mei2 is localized mainly in the cytoplasm of proliferating cells but is seen as a single spot close to the microtubule organizing centre in prophase nuclei during meiosis. Our results, and others from a metazoan, emphasize the crucial role of RNA-binding proteins in the initiation and execution of meiosis.
Retinoblastoma is one of several human tumors to which predisposition can be inherited. Molecular genetic analysis of several nonheritable cases has led to the hypothesis that this tumor develops after the occurrence of specific mitotic events involving human chromosome 13. These events reveal initial predisposing recessive mutations. Evidence is presented that similar chromosomal events occur in tumors from heritable cases. The chromosome 13 found in the tumors was the one carrying the predisposing germline mutation and not the homolog containing the wild-type allele at the Rb-1 locus. These results suggest a new approach for identifying recessive mutant genes that lead to cancer and a conceptual basis for accurate prenatal predictions of cancer predisposition.
In the Appalachians, late Paleozoic Alleghanian orogenesis is widely regarded as resulting from dextral oblique collision between irregular margins of Gondwana and Laurentia. However, this relative plate motion cannot account for coeval convergence in the Ouachitas and Variscides and is incompatible with some tectonic transport indicators in the Appalachians. An alternative kinematic model is proposed in which early sinistral transpression in the Appalachians is followed by counterclockwise rotation of Gondwana and the development of a system of dextral strike-slip faults extending from southern Europe to Alabama.
Retroviruses are the only group of viruses known to have left a fossil record, in the form of endogenous proviruses, and approximately 8% of the human genome is made up of these elements. Although many other viruses, including non-retroviral RNA viruses, are known to generate DNA forms of their own genomes during replication, none has been found as DNA in the germline of animals. Bornaviruses, a genus of non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus, are unique among RNA viruses in that they establish persistent infection in the cell nucleus. Here we show that elements homologous to the nucleoprotein (N) gene of bornavirus exist in the genomes of several mammalian species, including humans, non-human primates, rodents and elephants. These sequences have been designated endogenous Borna-like N (EBLN) elements. Some of the primate EBLNs contain an intact open reading frame (ORF) and are expressed as mRNA. Phylogenetic analyses showed that EBLNs seem to have been generated by different insertional events in each specific animal family. Furthermore, the EBLN of a ground squirrel was formed by a recent integration event, whereas those in primates must have been formed more than 40 million years ago. We also show that the N mRNA of a current mammalian bornavirus, Borna disease virus (BDV), can form EBLN-like elements in the genomes of persistently infected cultured cells. Our results provide the first evidence for endogenization of non-retroviral virus-derived elements in mammalian genomes and give novel insights not only into generation of endogenous elements, but also into a role of bornavirus as a source of genetic novelty in its host.
The bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) regulates cellular motility and the synthesis of organelles and molecules that promote adhesion to a variety of biological and nonbiological surfaces. These properties likely require tight spatial and temporal regulation of c-di-GMP concentration. We have developed genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors to monitor c-di-GMP concentrations within single bacterial cells by microscopy. Fluctuations of c-di-GMP were visualized in diverse Gram-negative bacterial species and observed to be cell cycle dependent. Asymmetrical distribution of c-di-GMP in the progeny correlated with the time of cell division and polarization for Caulobacter crescentus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, asymmetrical distribution of c-di-GMP was observed as part of cell division, which may indicate an important regulatory step in extracellular organelle biosynthesis or function.
A new virus-like particle has been found in Drosophila. Thus far it has been detected only in electron micrographs of certain cells capable of division, such as those in larval imaginal disks, cell lines derived from imaginal disks, cells from a genetically controlled brain tumor, and adult gut cells. It appears to be slightly elliptical in shape, about 37 millimicrons by 45 millimicrons, and occurs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. From the evidence it is suggested that the particle is a new virus.
The interaction of B7-related molecules on antigen-presenting cells with CD28 or CTLA-4 antigens on T cells provides a second signal for T cell activation. Selection inhibition of the B7-CD28 or B7-CTLA-4 interactions produces antigen-specific T cell unresponsiveness in vitro and suppresses immune function in vivo. To determine whether selective inhibition of the B7-CD28 or B7-CTLA-4 interactions could suppress spontaneous autoimmune disease, a B7-binding protein was generated by genetic fusion of the extracellular domain of murine CTLA-4 to the Fc portion of a mouse immunoglobulin G2a monoclonal antibody (muCTLA4Ig). In lupus-prone NZB/NZW filial generation (F1) mice, treatment with muCTLA4Ig blocked autoantibody production and prolonged life, even when treatment was delayed until the most advanced stage of clinical illness. These findings suggest a possible role for human CTLA4Ig in the treatment of autoimmune diseases in humans.
The shape of a neurone--the projection and branching pattern of axons and dendrites--appears to be determined by a combination of intrinisic and environmental influences. We have previously shown that striatal target neurones influence the biochemical maturation of ascending mesencephalic dopamine (DA) cells in culture, as well as the elongation rate of DA neurites. Using a similar approach in which the morphology of individual DA cells can be studied after 3H-DA uptake and autoradiography, we now report on in vitro neurone-glia interactions and show that glial cells exert a morphogenetic effect on DA neurones. Dopaminergic neurones from the mesencephalon were plated on glial monolayers prepared either from the striatal or the mesencephalic region of the embryonic brain. On mesencephalic glial cells the majority of DA neurones develop a great number of highly branched and varicose neurites, whereas on striatal glia they only exhibit one long, thin and rather linear neurite. These results demonstrate that glial cells from two different brain regions have distinct properties which could be used to define neuronal polarity observed in vivo.
A key event in the response of cells to proliferative signals is the rapid, transient induction of the c-fos proto-oncogene, which is mediated through the serum response element (SRE) in the fos promoter. Genomic footprinting and transfection experiments suggest that this activation occurs through a ternary complex that includes the serum response factor (SRF) and the ternary complex factor p62. Interaction of p62TCF with the SRF-SRE binary complex requires a CAGGA tract immediately upstream of the SRE. Proteins of the ets proto-oncogene family bind to similar sequences and we have found that a member of this family, Elk-1, forms SRF-dependent ternary complexes with the SRE. Elk-1 and p62TCF have the same DNA sequence requirements and antibodies against Elk-1 block the binding of both proteins. Furthermore, we show that like p62TCF, Elk-1 forms complexes with the yeast SRF-homologue MCM1 but not with yeast ARG80. But ARG80 mutants that convey interaction with p62TCF can also form complexes with Elk-1. The similarity, or even identity, between Elk-1 and p62TCF suggests a novel regulatory role for Ets proteins that is effected through interaction with other proteins, such as SRF. Furthermore, the possible involvement of an Ets protein in the control of c-fos has interesting implications for proto-oncogene cooperation in cellular growth control.
Candida glabrata is an important fungal pathogen of humans that is responsible for about 15 percent of mucosal and systemic candidiasis. Candida glabrata adhered avidly to human epithelial cells in culture. By means of a genetic approach and a strategy allowing parallel screening of mutants, it was possible to clone a lectin from a Candida species. Deletion of this adhesin reduced adherence of C. glabrata to human epithelial cells by 95 percent. The adhesin, encoded by the EPA1 gene, is likely a glucan-cross-linked cell-wall protein and binds to host-cell carbohydrate, specifically recognizing asialo-lactosyl-containing carbohydrates.
The evolutionary history of the symbiosis between fungus-growing ants (Attini) and their fungi was elucidated by comparing phylogenies of both symbionts. The fungal phylogeny based on cladistic analyses of nuclear 28S ribosomal DNA indicates that, in contrast with the monophyly of the ants, the attine fungi are polyphyletic. Most cultivated fungi belong to the basidiomycete family Lepiotaceae; however, one ant genus, Apterostigma, has acquired a distantly related basidiomycete lineage. Phylogenetic patterns suggest that some primitive attines may have repeatedly acquired lepiotaceous symbionts. In contrast, the most derived attines have clonally propagated the same fungal lineage for at least 23 million years.
The Escherichia coli recA gene product is both a direct participant and a central regulatory element in important processes of DNA repair, including one that is probably responsible for all radiation mutagenesis and some chemical mutagenesis. It has the direct function of catalysing pairing of single-stranded DNA to a homologous region in duplex DNA, a reaction thought to be fundamental to genetic recombination. This activity of recA protein probably contributes to DNA repair by promoting recombination between damaged DNA molecules. We have shown that recA protein also has a regulatory function, mediated by its ability to destroy repressors and possibly other proteins by proteolytic cleavage, leading to the induction of certain genes; these include recA itself, regulated by the lexA gene product, other genes probably involved in DNA repair, some of which are also regulated by the lexA gene product, and the early genes of temperate bacteriophages, which are regulated by their repressors, recA protein is activated to cleave repressors in vitro by interaction with ATP (or the ATP analogue ATP-gamma S) and a polynucleotide such as single-stranded DNA, probably the same interaction that initiates the strand-pairing reaction. We have proposed that recA protein is also activated to attack repressors in vivo when it interacts with single-stranded DNA; DNA-damaging treatments such as UV-ray irradiation would thereby invoke the recA-dependent functions of recombination, repair, mutagenesis and prophage induction. As further evidence that the proteolytic activity of recA protein is responsible for its regulatory function, we show here that the ability of two mutationally altered recA proteins to cleave phage lambda repressor correlates with the ability of the mutant cells to induce prophage.
Histones are subject to numerous post-translational modifications. Some of these 'epigenetic' marks recruit proteins that modulate chromatin structure. For example, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) binds to histone H3 when its lysine 9 residue has been tri-methylated by the methyltransferase Suv39h (refs 2-6). During mitosis, H3 is also phosphorylated by the kinase Aurora B. Although H3 phosphorylation is a hallmark of mitosis, its function remains mysterious. It has been proposed that histone phosphorylation controls the binding of proteins to chromatin, but any such mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that antibodies against mitotic chromosomal antigens that are associated with human autoimmune diseases specifically recognize H3 molecules that are modified by both tri-methylation of lysine 9 and phosphorylation of serine 10 (H3K9me3S10ph). The generation of H3K9me3S10ph depends on Suv39h and Aurora B, and occurs at pericentric heterochromatin during mitosis in different eukaryotes. Most HP1 typically dissociates from chromosomes during mitosis, but if phosphorylation of H3 serine 10 is inhibited, HP1 remains chromosome-bound throughout mitosis. H3 phosphorylation by Aurora B is therefore part of a 'methyl/phos switch' mechanism that displaces HP1 and perhaps other proteins from mitotic heterochromatin.
We identified a previously unknown riboswitch class in bacteria that is selectively triggered by glycine. A representative of these glycine-sensing RNAs from Bacillus subtilis operates as a rare genetic on switch for the gcvT operon, which codes for proteins that form the glycine cleavage system. Most glycine riboswitches integrate two ligand-binding domains that function cooperatively to more closely approximate a two-state genetic switch. This advanced form of riboswitch may have evolved to ensure that excess glycine is efficiently used to provide carbon flux through the citric acid cycle and maintain adequate amounts of the amino acid for protein synthesis. Thus, riboswitches perform key regulatory roles and exhibit complex performance characteristics that previously had been observed only with protein factors.
External agents of mortality (disturbances) occur over a wide range of scales of space and time, and are believed to have large effects on species diversity. The "intermediate disturbance hypothesis", which proposes maximum diversity at intermediate frequencies of disturbance, has received support from both field and laboratory studies. Coexistence of species at intermediate frequencies of disturbance is thought to require trade-offs between competitive ability and disturbance tolerance, and a metapopulation structure, with disturbance affecting only a few patches at any given time. However, a unimodal relationship can also be generated by global disturbances that affect all patches simultaneously, provided that the environment contains spatial niches to which different species are adapted. Here we report the results of tests of this model using both isogenic and diverse populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. In both cases, a unimodal relationship between diversity and disturbance frequency was generated in heterogeneous, but not in homogeneous, environments. The cause of this relationship is competition among niche-specialist genotypes, which maintains diversity at intermediate disturbance, but not at high or low disturbance. Our results show that disturbance can modulate the effect of spatial heterogeneity on biological diversity in natural environments.
Reduced fecundity, associated with severe mental disorders, places negative selection pressure on risk alleles and may explain, in part, why common variants have not been found that confer risk of disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and mental retardation. Thus, rare variants may account for a larger fraction of the overall genetic risk than previously assumed. In contrast to rare single nucleotide mutations, rare copy number variations (CNVs) can be detected using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. This has led to the identification of CNVs associated with mental retardation and autism. In a genome-wide search for CNVs associating with schizophrenia, we used a population-based sample to identify de novo CNVs by analysing 9,878 transmissions from parents to offspring. The 66 de novo CNVs identified were tested for association in a sample of 1,433 schizophrenia cases and 33,250 controls. Three deletions at 1q21.1, 15q11.2 and 15q13.3 showing nominal association with schizophrenia in the first sample (phase I) were followed up in a second sample of 3,285 cases and 7,951 controls (phase II). All three deletions significantly associate with schizophrenia and related psychoses in the combined sample. The identification of these rare, recurrent risk variants, having occurred independently in multiple founders and being subject to negative selection, is important in itself. CNV analysis may also point the way to the identification of additional and more prevalent risk variants in genes and pathways involved in schizophrenia.
DNA polymorphism in the Y chromosome, examined at a 729-base pair intron located immediately upstream of the ZFY zinc-finger exon, revealed no sequence variation in a worldwide sample of 38 human males. This finding cannot be explained by global constraint on the intron sequence, because interspecific comparisons with other nonhuman primates revealed phylogenetically informative sequence changes. The invariance likely results from either a recent selective sweep, a recent origin for modern Homo sapiens, recurrent male population bottlenecks, or historically small effective male population sizes. A coalescence model predicts an expected time to a most recent common ancestral male lineage of 270,000 years (95 percent confidence limits: 0 to 800,000 years).
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a unique opportunity for regenerative medicine because they offer the prospect of generating unlimited quantities of cells for autologous transplantation, with potential application in treatments for a broad range of disorders. However, the use of human iPSCs in the context of genetically inherited human disease will require the correction of disease-causing mutations in a manner that is fully compatible with clinical applications. The methods currently available, such as homologous recombination, lack the necessary efficiency and also leave residual sequences in the targeted genome. Therefore, the development of new approaches to edit the mammalian genome is a prerequisite to delivering the clinical promise of human iPSCs. Here we show that a combination of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and piggyBac technology in human iPSCs can achieve biallelic correction of a point mutation (Glu342Lys) in the a(1)-antitrypsin (A1AT, also known as SERPINA1) gene that is responsible for a(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. Genetic correction of human iPSCs restored the structure and function of A1AT in subsequently derived liver cells in vitro and in vivo. This approach is significantly more efficient than any other gene-targeting technology that is currently available and crucially prevents contamination of the host genome with residual non-human sequences. Our results provide the first proof of principle, to our knowledge, for the potential of combining human iPSCs with genetic correction to generate clinically relevant cells for autologous cell-based therapies.
The success of forward genetic (from phenotype to gene) approaches to uncover genes that drive the molecular mechanism of circadian clocks and control circadian behavior has been unprecedented. Links among genes, cells, neural circuits, and circadian behavior have been uncovered in the Drosophila and mammalian systems, demonstrating the feasibility of finding single genes that have major effects on behavior. Why was this approach so successful in the elucidation of circadian rhythms? This article explores the answers to this question and describes how the methods used successfully for identifying the molecular basis of circadian rhythms can be applied to other behaviors such as anxiety, addiction, and learning and memory.
Although molecular data have revealed the vast scope of microbial diversity, two fundamental questions remain unanswered even for well-defined natural microbial communities: how many bacterial types co-exist, and are such types naturally organized into phylogenetically discrete units of potential ecological significance? It has been argued that without such information, the environmental function, population biology and biogeography of microorganisms cannot be rigorously explored. Here we address these questions by comprehensive sampling of two large 16S ribosomal RNA clone libraries from a coastal bacterioplankton community. We show that compensation for artefacts generated by common library construction techniques reveals fine-scale patterns of community composition. At least 516 ribotypes (unique rRNA sequences) were detected in the sample and, by statistical extrapolation, at least 1,633 co-existing ribotypes in the sampled population. More than 50% of the ribotypes fall into discrete clusters containing less than 1% sequence divergence. This pattern cannot be accounted for by interoperon variation, indicating a large predominance of closely related taxa in this community. We propose that such microdiverse clusters arise by selective sweeps and persist because competitive mechanisms are too weak to purge diversity from within them.
Predators typically avoid dangerous species, and batesian mimicry evolves when a palatable species (the 'mimic') co-opts a warning signal from a dangerous species (the 'model') and thereby deceives its potential predators. Because predators would not be under selection to avoid the model and any of its look-alikes in areas where the model is absent (that is, allopatry), batesian mimics should occur only in sympatry with their model. However, contrary to this expectation, batesian mimics often occur in allopatry. Here we focus on one such example--a coral snake mimic. Using indirect DNA-based methods, we provide evidence suggesting that mimics migrate from sympatry, where mimicry is favoured, to allopatry, where it is disfavoured. Such gene flow is much stronger in nuclear genes than in maternally inherited mitochondrial genes, indicating that dispersal by males may explain the presence of mimetic phenotypes in allopatry. Despite this gene flow, however, individuals from allopatry resemble the model less than do individuals from sympatry. We show that this breakdown of mimicry probably reflects predator-mediated selection acting against individuals expressing the more conspicuous mimetic phenotype in allopatry. Thus, although gene flow may explain why batesian mimics occur in allopatry, natural selection may often override such gene flow and promote the evolution of non-mimetic phenotypes in such areas.
The use of molecular biological approaches has defined new mechanisms that store information in the mammalian nervous system. Environmental stimuli alter steady-state levels of messenger RNA species encoding neurotransmitters, thereby altering synaptic, neuronal, and network function over time. External or internal stimuli alter impulse activity, which alters membrane depolarization and selectively changes the expression of specific transmitter genes. These processes occur in diverse peripheral and central neurons, suggesting that information storage is widespread in the neuraxis. The temporal profile of any particular molecular mnemonic process is determined by specific kinetics of turnover and by the geometry of the neuron resulting in axonal transport of molecules to different synaptic arrays at different times. Generally, transmitters, the agents of millisecond-to-millisecond communication, are subject to relatively long-lasting changes in expression, ensuring that ongoing physiological function is translated into information storage.
X-chromosome inactivation in mammals is a regulatory phenomenon whereby one of the two X chromosomes in female cells is genetically inactivated, resulting in dosage compensation for X-linked genes between males and females. In both man and mouse, X-chromosome inactivation is thought to proceed from a single cis-acting switch region or inactivation centre (XIC/Xic). In the human, XIC has been mapped to band Xq13 (ref. 6) and in the mouse to band XD (ref. 7), and comparative mapping has shown that the XIC regions in the two species are syntenic. The recently described human XIST gene maps to the XIC region and seems to be expressed only from the inactive X chromosome. We report here that the mouse Xist gene maps to the Xic region of the mouse X chromosome and, using an interspecific Mus spretus/Mus musculus domesticus F1 hybrid mouse carrying the T(X;16)16H translocation, show that Xist is exclusively expressed from the inactive X chromosome. Conservation between man and mouse of chromosomal position and unique expression exclusively from the inactive X chromosome lends support to the hypothesis that XIST and its mouse homologue are involved in X-chromosome inactivation.
Wound healing is essential for maintaining the integrity of multicellular organisms. In every species studied, disruption of an epithelial layer instantaneously generates endogenous electric fields, which have been proposed to be important in wound healing. The identity of signalling pathways that guide both cell migration to electric cues and electric-field-induced wound healing have not been elucidated at a genetic level. Here we show that electric fields, of a strength equal to those detected endogenously, direct cell migration during wound healing as a prime directional cue. Manipulation of endogenous wound electric fields affects wound healing in vivo. Electric stimulation triggers activation of Src and inositol-phospholipid signalling, which polarizes in the direction of cell migration. Notably, genetic disruption of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-gamma (PI(3)Kgamma) decreases electric-field-induced signalling and abolishes directed movements of healing epithelium in response to electric signals. Deletion of the tumour suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) enhances signalling and electrotactic responses. These data identify genes essential for electrical-signal-induced wound healing and show that PI(3)Kgamma and PTEN control electrotaxis.
The cell cycles of early Xenopus embryos consist of a rapid succession of alternating S and M phases. These cycles are controlled by the activity of a protein kinase complex (cdc2 kinase) which contains two subunits. One subunit is encoded by the frog homologue of the fission yeast cdc2+ gene, p34cdc2 and the other is a cyclin. The concentration of cyclins follows a sawtooth oscillation because they accumulate in interphase and are destroyed abruptly during mitosis. The association of cyclin and p34cdc2 is not sufficient for activation of cdc2 kinase, however; dephosphorylation of key tyrosine and threonine residues of p34cdc2 is necessary to turn on its kinase activity. The activity of cdc2 kinase is thus regulated by a combination of translational and post-translational mechanisms. The loss of cdc2 kinase activity at the end of mitosis depends on the destruction of the cyclin subunits. It has been suggested that this destruction is induced by cdc2 kinase itself, thereby providing a negative feedback loop to terminate mitosis. Here we report direct experimental evidence for this idea by showing that cyclin proteolysis can be triggered by adding cdc2 kinase to a cell-free extract of interphase Xenopus eggs.
Identification of a mutant epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor that does not undergo downregulation has provided a genetic probe to investigate the role of internalization in ligand-induced mitogenesis. Contact-inhibited cells expressing this internalization-defective receptor exhibited a normal mitogenic response at significantly lower ligand concentrations than did cells expressing wild-type receptors. A transformed phenotype and anchorage-independent growth were observed at ligand concentrations that failed to elicit these responses in cells expressing wild-type receptors. These findings imply that activation of the protein tyrosine kinase activity at the cell membrane is sufficient for the growth-enhancing effects of EGF. Thus, downregulation can serve as an attenuation mechanism, without which transformation ensues.
Recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene initiate aggressive forms of leukaemia, which are often refractory to conventional therapies. Many MLL-fusion partners are members of the super elongation complex (SEC), a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation, suggesting that aberrant control of this process has an important role in leukaemia induction. Here we use a global proteomic strategy to demonstrate that MLL fusions, as part of SEC and the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc), are associated with the BET family of acetyl-lysine recognizing, chromatin 'adaptor' proteins. These data provided the basis for therapeutic intervention in MLL-fusion leukaemia, via the displacement of the BET family of proteins from chromatin. We show that a novel small molecule inhibitor of the BET family, GSK1210151A (I-BET151), has profound efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukaemic cell lines, through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151 treatment in two human leukaemia cell lines with different MLL fusions alters the expression of a common set of genes whose function may account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes (BCL2, C-MYC and CDK6) through the displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo studies indicate that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value, providing survival benefit in two distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9 and human MLL-AF4 leukaemia. Finally, the efficacy of I-BET151 against human leukaemia stem cells is demonstrated, providing further evidence of its potent therapeutic potential. These findings establish the displacement of BET proteins from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for these aggressive leukaemias.
Endothelial dysfunction or activation elicited by oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, characterized by intimal thickening and lipid deposition in the arteries. Ox-LDL and its lipid constituents impair endothelial production of nitric oxide, and induce the endothelial expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and smooth-muscle growth factors, which may be involved in atherogenesis. Vascular endothelial cells in culture and in vivo internalize and degrade Ox-LDL through a putative receptor-mediated pathway that does not involve macrophage scavenger receptors. Here we report the molecular cloning, using expression cloning strategy, of an Ox-LDL receptor from vascular endothelial cells. The cloned receptor is a membrane protein that belongs structurally to the C-type lectin family, and is expressed in vivo in vascular endothelium and vascular-rich organs.
The presence of both parental genomes is essential for development to term in the mouse embryo probably because of germline-specific modifications of homologous chromosomes. Neither androgenetic nor parthenogenetic embryos can by themselves develop to term; any post-implantation embryos they produce have opposite phenotypes, which reflects the presence of complementary information in parental chromosomes. The development of androgenetic----parthenogenetic chimaeras is of considerable interest because in this case both parental chromosomes are available even though they are in separate cells. We demonstrate here that in post-implantation chimaeric fetuses, the expression of parental information results in spatial specificity so that parthenogenetic cells are confined to the embryo but the trophoblast consists almost entirely of androgenetic cells. The yolk sac contains both cell types. However, there is incomplete functional complementation because the chimaeras do not reach term. Although failure to reach term may occur partly because of inadequate intermingling and interactions between embryonic cells, it is more likely that further control of mouse development depends on the presence of both sets of chromosomes within the same cells.
The molecular architecture of-and biochemical processes within--cell membranes play important roles in all living organisms, with many drugs and infectious disease agents targeting membranes. Experimental studies of biochemical reactions on membrane surfaces are challenging, as they require a membrane environment that is fluid (like cell membranes) but nevertheless allows for the efficient detection and characterization of molecular interactions. One approach uses lipid membranes supported on solid substrates such as silica or polymers: although the membrane is trapped near the solid interface, it retains natural fluidity and biological functionality and can be implanted with membrane proteins for functional studies. But the detection of molecular interactions involving membrane-bound species generally requires elaborate techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance or total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Here we demonstrate that colloidal phase transitions of membrane-coated silica beads provide a simple and label-free method for monitoring molecular interactions on lipid membrane surfaces. By adjusting the lipid membrane composition and hence the pair interaction potential between the membrane-supporting silica beads, we poise our system near a phase transition so that small perturbations on the membrane surface induce dramatic changes in the macroscopic organization of the colloid. We expect that this approach, used here to probe with high sensitivity protein binding events at membrane surfaces, can be applied to study a broad range of cell membrane processes.
DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark for transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in diverse organisms. Recent studies suggest that the methylation status of a number of genes is dynamically regulated by methylation and demethylation. In Arabidopsis, active DNA demethylation is mediated by the ROS1 (repressor of silencing 1) subfamily of 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases through a base excision repair pathway. These demethylases have critical roles in erasing DNA methylation and preventing TGS of target genes. However, it is not known how the demethylases are targeted to specific sequences. Here we report the identification of ROS3, an essential regulator of DNA demethylation that contains an RNA recognition motif. Analysis of ros3 mutants and ros1 ros3 double mutants suggests that ROS3 acts in the same genetic pathway as ROS1 to prevent DNA hypermethylation and TGS. Gel mobility shift assays and analysis of ROS3 immunoprecipitate from plant extracts shows that ROS3 binds to small RNAs in vitro and in vivo. Immunostaining shows that ROS3 and ROS1 proteins co-localize in discrete foci dispersed throughout the nucleus. These results demonstrate a critical role for ROS3 in preventing DNA hypermethylation and suggest that DNA demethylation by ROS1 may be guided by RNAs bound to ROS3.
The availability of dense genetic linkage maps of mammalian genomes makes feasible a wide range of studies, including positional cloning of monogenic traits, genetic dissection of polygenic traits, construction of genome-wide physical maps, rapid marker-assisted construction of congenic strains, and evolutionary comparisons. We have been engaged for the past five years in a concerted effort to produce a dense genetic map of the laboratory mouse. Here we present the final report of this project. The map contains 7,377 genetic markers, consisting of 6,580 highly informative simple sequence length polymorphisms integrated with 797 restriction fragment length polymorphisms in mouse genes. The average spacing between markers is about 0.2 centimorgans or 400 kilobases.
The TGF-beta superfamily of proteins regulates many different biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation and embryonic pattern formation. TGF-beta-like factors signal across cell membranes through complexes of transmembrane receptors known as type I and type II serine/threonine-kinase receptors, which in turn activate the SMAD signalling pathway. On the inside of the cell membrane, a receptor-regulated class of SMADs are phosphorylated by the type-I-receptor kinase. In this way, receptors for different factors are able to pass on specific signals along the pathway: for example, receptors for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) target SMADs 1, 5 and 8, whereas receptors for activin and TGF-beta target SMADs 2 and 3. Phosphorylation of receptor-regulated SMADs induces their association with Smad4, the 'common-partner' SMAD, and stimulates accumulation of this complex in the nucleus, where it regulates transcriptional responses. Here we describe Smurf1, a new member of the Hect family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Smurf1 selectively interacts with receptor-regulated SMADs specific for the BMP pathway in order to trigger their ubiquitination and degradation, and hence their inactivation. In the amphibian Xenopus laevis, Smurf1 messenger RNA is localized to the animal pole of the egg; in Xenopus embryos, ectopic Smurf1 inhibits the transmission of BMP signals and thereby affects pattern formation. Smurf1 also enhances cellular responsiveness to the Smad2 (activin/TGF-beta) pathway. Thus, targeted ubiquitination of SMADs may serve to control both embryonic development and a wide variety of cellular responses to TGF-beta signals.
The application of recombinant DNA techniques has identified two fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis in man. The first involves a qualitative or quantitative change in an oncogene (see ref. 1 for review). In the second, discovered in embryonal tumours, a primary mutation occurs which is recessive at the cellular level to the normal allele. The growth of a tumour ensues only after a secondary change, such as chromosome loss or mitotic recombination, eliminates the normal allele, thereby unmasking the altered allele. Because its effect is recessive, the primary mutation may also occur and be transmitted in the germ line, resulting in a familial pattern for the disease. In familial cases, independent bilateral tumours are common, since the tumours result from a single event--loss of the normal genes--which can occur in any cell. This contrasts with non-familial (sporadic) cases where solitary tumours result from the infrequent occurrence of two rare events within the same cell. By a molecular genetic approach we have now shown that acoustic neuroma, one of the most common tumours of the human nervous system, is specifically associated with loss of genes on human chromosome 22 and may result from the mechanism of tumorigenesis discovered in embryonal tumours. This finding might provide a clue to the chromosomal location of the defective gene in bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, an autosomal dominant disorder with the hallmark of bilateral acoustic neuromas. In view of the frequent occurrence of meningiomas in patients with bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis and the association of meningioma with loss of chromosome 22 previously reported in cytogenetic studies, we suggest that a common event underlies tumorigenesis in acoustic neuroma and meningioma.
Amphisbaenia is a speciose clade of fossorial lizards characterized by a snake-like body and a strongly reinforced skull adapted for head-first burrowing. The evolutionary origins of amphisbaenians are controversial, with molecular data uniting them with lacertids, a clade of Old World terrestrial lizards, whereas morphology supports a grouping with snakes and other limbless squamates. Reports of fossil stem amphisbaenians have been falsified, and no fossils have previously tested these competing phylogenetic hypotheses or shed light on ancestral amphisbaenian ecology. Here we report the discovery of a new lacertid-like lizard from the Eocene Messel locality of Germany that provides the first morphological evidence for lacertid-amphisbaenian monophyly on the basis of a reinforced, akinetic skull roof and braincase, supporting the view that body elongation and limblessness in amphisbaenians and snakes evolved independently. Morphometric analysis of body shape and ecology in squamates indicates that the postcranial anatomy of the new taxon is most consistent with opportunistically burrowing habits, which in combination with cranial reinforcement indicates that head-first burrowing evolved before body elongation and may have been a crucial first step in the evolution of amphisbaenian fossoriality.
A chimeric gene containing a cloned cDNA of the coat protein (CP) gene of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was introduced into tobacco cells on a Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens from which tumor inducing genes had been removed. Plants regenerated from transformed cells expressed TMV mRNA and CP as a nuclear trait. Seedlings from self-fertilized transgenic plants were inoculated with TMV and observed for development of disease symptoms. The seedlings that expressed the CP gene were delayed in symptom development and 10 to 60 percent of the transgenic plants failed to develop symptoms for the duration of the experiments. Increasing the concentration of TMV in the inoculum shortened the delay in appearance of symptoms. The results of these experiments indicate that plants can be genetically transformed for resistance to virus disease development.
DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification of the genome that regulates crucial aspects of its function. Genomic methylation patterns in somatic differentiated cells are generally stable and heritable. However, in mammals there are at least two developmental periods-in germ cells and in preimplantation embryos-in which methylation patterns are reprogrammed genome wide, generating cells with a broad developmental potential. Epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells is critical for imprinting; reprogramming in early embryos also affects imprinting. Reprogramming is likely to have a crucial role in establishing nuclear totipotency in normal development and in cloned animals, and in the erasure of acquired epigenetic information. A role of reprogramming in stem cell differentiation is also envisaged. DNA methylation is one of the best-studied epigenetic modifications of DNA in all unicellular and multicellular organisms. In mammals and other vertebrates, methylation occurs predominantly at the symmetrical dinucleotide CpG (1-4). Symmetrical methylation and the discovery of a DNA methyltransferase that prefers a hemimethylated substrate, Dnmt1 (4), suggested a mechanism by which specific patterns of methylation in the genome could be maintained. Patterns imposed on the genome at defined developmental time points in precursor cells could be maintained by Dnmt1, and would lead to predetermined programs of gene expression during development in descendants of the precursor cells (5, 6). This provided a means to explain how patterns of differentiation could be maintained by populations of cells. In addition, specific demethylation events in differentiated tissues could then lead to further changes in gene expression as needed. Neat and convincing as this model is, it is still largely unsubstantiated. While effects of methylation on expression of specific genes, particularly imprinted ones (7) and some retrotransposons (8), have been demonstrated in vivo, it is still unclear whether or not methylation is involved in the control of gene expression during normal development (9-13). Although enzymes have been identified that can methylate DNA de novo (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) (14), it is unknown how specific patterns of methylation are established in the genome. Mechanisms for active demethylation have been suggested, but no enzymes have been identified that carry out this function in vivo (15-17). Genomewide alterations in methylation-brought about, for example, by knockouts of the methylase genes-result in embryo lethality or developmental defects, but the basis for abnormal development still remains to be discovered (7, 14). What is clear, however, is that in mammals there are developmental periods of genomewide reprogramming of methylation patterns in vivo. Typically, a substantial part of the genome is demethylated, and after some time remethylated, in a cell- or tissue-specific pattern. The developmental dynamics of these reprogramming events, as well as some of the enzymatic mechanisms involved and the biological purposes, are beginning to be understood. Here we look at what is known about reprogramming in mammals and discuss how it might relate to developmental potency and imprinting.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important human pathogen responsible for over 200 million cases of chronic infection, many of which progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Although HBV cannot be propagated in tissue culture, highly effective subunit vaccines obtained from the plasma of chronically infected patients have been developed and licensed. Such vaccines are safe but their expense and limited quantities make them unavailable to most Third World countries. Other approaches to vaccine construction, including purification of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) from genetically engineered eukaryotic cells and the synthesis of peptides predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the HBsAg gene, are still under evaluation. Another potential application of recombinant DNA technology to vaccine development is the use of live virus vectors to express foreign genes. An infectious vaccinia virus recombinant that expressed the HBsAg in animal cells and which stimulated the production of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) in rabbits represented a novel candidate vaccine of this class. As a continuation of our earlier study, we now present evidence that chimpanzees vaccinated with a live recombinant vaccinia virus protected against hepatitis following challenge with HBV.
Antipyrine was administered to identical or monozygotic twins and to fraternal or dizygotic twins. Individuals with identical genotypes (monozygotic twins) exhibited significantly less variability in antipyrine halflife than did genetically different individuals (dizygotic twins). Therefore variations in antipyrine metabolism appear to be determined genetically rather than environmentally. In the 36 twins tested, antipyrine half-lives varied between 5.1 and 16.7 hours. No significant correlation occurred between half-lives for phenylbutazone and antipyrine in the 28 twins who received both drugs.
The forces that maintain genetic diversity among individuals and diversity among species are usually studied separately. Nevertheless, diversity at one of these levels may depend on the diversity at the other. We have combined observations of natural populations, quantitative genetics, and field experiments to show that genetic variation in the concentration of an allelopathic secondary compound in Brassica nigra is necessary for the coexistence of B. nigra and its competitor species. In addition, the diversity of competing species was required for the maintenance of genetic variation in the trait within B. nigra. Thus, conservation of species diversity may also necessitate maintenance of the processes that sustain the genetic diversity of each individual species.
A recent explosion in newly discovered vascular growth factors has coincided with exploitation of powerful new genetic approaches for studying vascular development. An emerging rule is that all of these factors must be used in perfect harmony to form functional vessels. These new findings also demand re-evaluation of therapeutic efforts aimed at regulating blood vessel growth in ischaemia, cancer and other pathological settings.
There is an urgent need to preserve the ever-increasing number (greater than 30,000) of different genetic strains of D. melanogaster that are maintained in national and international stock centres and in the laboratories of individual investigators. In all cases, the stocks are maintained as adult populations and require transfer to fresh medium every two to four weeks. This is not only costly in terms of materials, labour and space, but unique strains are vulnerable to accidental loss, contamination, and changes in genotype that can occur during continuous culture through mutation, genetic drift or selection. Although cryopreservation of Drosophila germ-plasm would be an enormous advantage, many attempts using conventional procedures have been unsuccessful. D. melanogaster embryos are refractory to conventional cryopreservation procedures because of the contravening conditions required to minimize mortality resulting from both intracellular ice formation and chilling injury at subzero temperatures. To overcome these obstacles, we have developed a vitrification procedure that precludes intracellular ice formation so that the embryos can be cooled and warmed at ultra-rapid rates to minimize chilling injury, and have recovered viable embryos following storage in liquid nitrogen. In a series of 53 experiments, a total of 3,711 larvae emerged from 17,280 eggs that were cooled in liquid nitrogen (18.4 +/- 8.8%). Further, using a subset from this population, approximately 3% of the surviving larvae (24/800) developed into adults. These adults were fertile and produced an F1 generation.
Angiogenesis does not only depend on endothelial cell invasion and proliferation: it also requires pericyte coverage of vascular sprouts for vessel stabilization. These processes are coordinated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) through their cognate receptors on endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), respectively. PDGF induces neovascularization by priming VSMCs/pericytes to release pro-angiogenic mediators. Although VEGF directly stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration, its role in pericyte biology is less clear. Here we define a role for VEGF as an inhibitor of neovascularization on the basis of its capacity to disrupt VSMC function. Specifically, under conditions of PDGF-mediated angiogenesis, VEGF ablates pericyte coverage of nascent vascular sprouts, leading to vessel destabilization. At the molecular level, VEGF-mediated activation of VEGF-R2 suppresses PDGF-Rbeta signalling in VSMCs through the assembly of a previously undescribed receptor complex consisting of PDGF-Rbeta and VEGF-R2. Inhibition of VEGF-R2 not only prevents assembly of this receptor complex but also restores angiogenesis in tissues exposed to both VEGF and PDGF. Finally, genetic deletion of tumour cell VEGF disrupts PDGF-Rbeta/VEGF-R2 complex formation and increases tumour vessel maturation. These findings underscore the importance of VSMCs/pericytes in neovascularization and reveal a dichotomous role for VEGF and VEGF-R2 signalling as both a promoter of endothelial cell function and a negative regulator of VSMCs and vessel maturation.
In Tetrahymena thermophila the major argument for the existence of diploid subunits has been that some loci show a delay in the accumulation of stable subclones during macronuclear assortment. This delay is based on the assumption that throughout the life cycle there are 45 subunits. We find that for at least 50 fissions after conjugation there is sufficient DNA for 66 haploid subunits. These additional subunits early in the life cycle are sufficient to explain the observed accumulation of stable subclones in all instances. This removes the need to invoke diploidy to explain assortment, thus resolving the question of subunit ploidy in favor of haploidy.
The organizer of the vertebrate gastrula is an important signalling centre that induces and patterns dorsal axial structures. Although a topic of long-standing interest, the evolutionary origin of the organizer remains unclear. Here we show that the gastrula of the cephalochordate amphioxus expresses dorsal/ventral (D/V) patterning genes (for example, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), Nodal and their antagonists) in patterns reminiscent of those of their vertebrate orthlogues, and that amphioxus embryos, like those of vertebrates, are ventralized by exogenous BMP protein. In addition, Wnt-antagonists (for example, Dkks and sFRP2-like) are expressed anteriorly, whereas Wnt genes themselves are expressed posteriorly, consistent with a role for Wnt signalling in anterior/posterior (A/P) patterning. These results suggest evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms for both D/V and A/P patterning of the early gastrula. In light of recent phylogenetic analyses placing cephalochordates basally in the chordate lineage, we propose that separate signalling centres for patterning the D/V and A/P axes may be an ancestral chordate character.
Two competing sensations of apparent movement were produced by the rapid alternation of two multielement stimulus frames. Either sensation could be made dominant by, appropriate manipulations of the stimulus display. The results suggest that there are two systems capable of generating movement signals in man. One system depends on preliminary processing of form, and the second system does not.
Certain cell fate decisions are specified by cell-cell interactions during the development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. For example, in a wild-type hermaphrodite gonad, two cells, Z1.ppp and Z4.aaa, have the potential to become the anchor cell (AC). Intercellular communication establishes their fates and ensures that only one cell becomes the AC, while the other becomes a ventral uterine precursor cell (VU). One component of this intercellular communication seems to be the 'AC-to-VU' signal from the presumptive AC that causes the other cell to become a VU. Genetic and developmental studies indicated that the lin-12 gene specifies the fates of Z1.ppp and Z4.aaa. Molecular studies suggest that lin-12 directly participates in their communications, perhaps acting as the receptor for the 'AC-to-VU' signal. Here, we report the molecular lesions associated with lin-12 gain-of-function mutations, cell isolation experiments, and genetic studies of an unusual lin-12 allele. These data suggest that self-association of the putative lin-12-encoded receptor leads to its activation, and that certain gain-of-function mutations result in ligand-independent activation.
Twentieth-century psychologists have been pessimistic about teaching reasoning, prevailing opinion suggesting that people may possess only domain-specific rules, rather than abstract rules; this would mean that training a rule in one domain would not produce generalization to other domains. Alternatively, it was thought that people might possess abstract rules (such as logical ones) but that these are induced developmentally through self-discovery methods and cannot be trained. Research suggests a much more optimistic view: even brief formal training in inferential rules may enhance their use for reasoning about everyday life events. Previous theorists may have been mistaken about trainability, in part because they misidentified the kind of rules that people use naturally.
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in man, also called the HLA region, is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 and encodes antigens involved in immunological processes. The class II HLA antigens consist of two noncovalently associated polypeptide chains, one of molecular weight 34,000 (alpha) and the other of molecular weight 29,000 (beta). The extensive polymorphism of the beta chain(s) has allowed the genetic mapping of the corresponding beta gene(s) to the HLA-DR region. cDNA clones for the HLA-DR alpha chain have been used to map the non-polymorphic DR alpha-chain gene to chromosome 6 using mouse-human somatic cell hybrids. Similarly, the DR alpha-chain gene has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6 centromeric to the HLA-A, -B and -C loci by in situ hybridization experiments. We isolated a cDNA clone that is related to the DR alpha chain and encodes the class II antigen DC alpha chain. We describe here how this DC alpha clone was used to find two or three additional alpha-chain genes by cross-hybridization and how HLA-antigen loss mutants of a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) were used to ascertain that these additional class II antigen alpha-chain genes are also located in the HLA region.
Mouse eggs with different genetic constitutions were prepared by micromanipulation of fertilized diploids and triploids. The diploid gynogenones, activated by the male gamete which was then removed, developed at best to about the 25-somite stage as did the genetically similar diploid parthenogenones stimulated to develop in the complete absence of the male gamete. The failure of development to term in both cases may be due to homozygosity and does not appear to be due to a lack of extragenetic contribution from spermatozoa.
The development of characteristic visceral asymmetries along the left-right (LR) axis in an initially bilaterally symmetrical embryo is an essential feature of vertebrate patterning. The allelic mouse mutations inversus viscerum (iv) and legless (lgl) produce LR inversion, or situs inversus, in half of live-born homozygotes. This suggests that the iv gene product drives correct LR determination, and in its absence this process is randomized. These mutations provide tools for studying the development of LR-handed asymmetry and provide mouse models of human lateralization defects. At the molecular level, the normally LR asymmetric expression patterns of nodal and lefty are randomized in iv/iv embryos, suggesting that iv functions early in the genetic hierarchy of LR specification. Here we report the positional cloning of an axonemal dynein heavy-chain gene, left/right-dynein (lrd), that is mutated in both lgl and iv. lrd is expressed in the node of the embryo at embryonic day 7.5, consistent with its having a role in LR development. Our findings indicate that dynein, a microtubule-based motor, is involved in the determination of LR-handed asymmetry and provide insight into the early molecular mechanisms of this process.
Large-scale increases in the heat content of the world's oceans have been observed to occur over the last 45 years. The horizontal and temporal character of these changes has been closely replicated by the state-of-the-art Parallel Climate Model (PCM) forced by observed and estimated anthropogenic gases. Application of optimal detection methodology shows that the model-produced signals are indistinguishable from the observations at the 0.05 confidence level. Further, the chances of either the anthropogenic or observed signals being produced by the PCM as a result of natural, internal forcing alone are less than 5%. This suggests that the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing, which broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system. Additionally, the requirement that modeled ocean heat uptakes match observations puts a strong, new constraint on anthropogenically forced climate models. It is unknown if the current generation of climate models, other than the PCM, meet this constraint.
The antimicrobial defence of Drosophila relies largely on the challenge-induced synthesis of an array of potent antimicrobial peptides by the fat body. The defence against Gram-positive bacteria and natural fungal infections is mediated by the Toll signalling pathway, whereas defence against Gram-negative bacteria is dependent on the Immune deficiency (IMD) pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. The link between microbial infections and activation of these two pathways has remained elusive. The Toll pathway is activated by Gram-positive bacteria through a circulating Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). PGRPs appear to be highly conserved from insects to mammals, and the Drosophila genome contains 13 members. Here we report a mutation in a gene coding for a putative transmembrane protein, PGRP-LC, which reduces survival to Gram-negative sepsis but has no effect on the response to Gram-positive bacteria or natural fungal infections. By genetic epistasis, we demonstrate that PGRP-LC acts upstream of the imd gene. The data on PGRP-SA with respect to the response to Gram-positive infections, together with the present report, indicate that the PGRP family has a principal role in sensing microbial infections in Drosophila.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to pathogenic bacteria with conserved innate immune responses and pathogen avoidance behaviors. We investigated natural variation in C. elegans resistance to pathogen infection. With the use of quantitative genetic analysis, we determined that the pathogen susceptibility difference between the laboratory wild-type strain N2 and the wild isolate CB4856 is caused by a polymorphism in the npr-1 gene, which encodes a homolog of the mammalian neuropeptide Y receptor. We show that the mechanism of NPR-1-mediated pathogen resistance is through oxygen-dependent behavioral avoidance rather than direct regulation of innate immunity. For C. elegans, bacteria represent food but also a potential source of infection. Our data underscore the importance of behavioral responses to oxygen levels in finding an optimal balance between these potentially conflicting cues.
The fragile X syndrome, a common cause of inherited mental retardation, is characterized by an unusual mode of inheritance. Phenotypic expression has been linked to abnormal cytosine methylation of a single CpG island, at or very near the fragile site. Probes adjacent to this island detected very localized DNA rearrangements that constituted the fragile X mutations, and whose target was a 550-base pair GC-rich fragment. Normal transmitting males had a 150- to 400-base pair insertion that was inherited by their daughters either unchanged, or with small differences in size. Fragile X-positive individuals in the next generation had much larger fragments that differed among siblings and showed a generally heterogeneous pattern indicating somatic mutation. The mutated allele appeared unmethylated in normal transmitting males, methylated only on the inactive X chromosome in their daughters, and totally methylated in most fragile X males. However, some males had a mosaic pattern. Expression of the fragile X syndrome thus appears to result from a two-step mutation as well as a highly localized methylation. Carriers of the fragile X mutation can easily be detected regardless of sex or phenotypic expression, and rare apparent false negatives may result from genetic heterogeneity or misdiagnosis.
Observations of tidal flow over a sill show that upstream solitary wave generation occurred in conjunction with the downstream movement of a streamline bifurcation over the obstacle crest. Solitary waves appeared upstream of the bifurcation, riding on the surface stratification. Shear flow instabilities on the plunging interface were also evident and may contribute to wave generation through subharmonic interaction. Nonlinear waves generated downstream of an internal control became trapped in the supercritical flow.
Twenty-four recessive lethal mutations were detected in a heterokaryon by the method of Atwood and Mukai. All controlled indispensable functions. Genetic analysis revealed that six of these failed to transmit the defect to their progeny. These mutants are believed to be semilethal genetic changes which express a lethal phenotype only in certain genetic backgrounds.
The identification of common variants that contribute to the genesis of human inherited disorders remains a significant challenge. Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non-mendelian disorder in which rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET contribute to risk in combination with mutations at other genes. We have used family-based association studies to identify a disease interval, and integrated this with comparative and functional genomic analysis to prioritize conserved and functional elements within which mutations can be sought. We now show that a common non-coding RET variant within a conserved enhancer-like sequence in intron 1 is significantly associated with HSCR susceptibility and makes a 20-fold greater contribution to risk than rare alleles do. This mutation reduces in vitro enhancer activity markedly, has low penetrance, has different genetic effects in males and females, and explains several features of the complex inheritance pattern of HSCR. Thus, common low-penetrance variants, identified by association studies, can underlie both common and rare diseases.
Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is one of man's commonest hereditary diseases. Several studies have implicated a defect in DNA mismatch repair in the pathogenesis of this disease. In particular, hMSH2 and hMLH1 homologues of the bacterial DNA mismatch repair genes mutS and mutL, respectively, were shown to be mutated in a subset of HNPCC cases. Here we report the nucleotide sequence, chromosome localization and mutational analysis of hPMS1 and hPMS2, two additional homologues of the prokaryotic mutL gene. Both hPMS1 and hPMS2 were found to be mutated in the germline of HNPCC patients. This doubles the number of genes implicated in HNPCC and may help explain the relatively high incidence of this disease.
DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with transposable element silencing and gene imprinting in flowering plants and mammals. In plants, imprinting occurs in the endosperm, which nourishes the embryo during seed development. We have profiled Arabidopsis DNA methylation genome-wide in the embryo and endosperm and found that large-scale methylation changes accompany endosperm development and endosperm-specific gene expression. Transposable element fragments are extensively demethylated in the endosperm. We discovered new imprinted genes by the identification of candidates associated with regions of reduced endosperm methylation and preferential expression in endosperm relative to other parts of the plant. These data suggest that imprinting in plants evolved from targeted methylation of transposable element insertions near genic regulatory elements followed by positive selection when the resulting expression change was advantageous.
Modern gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) emerged in the early Palaeozoic era, but this event remains unclear owing to a scant early fossil record. The exclusively Palaeozoic 'acanthodians' are possibly the earliest gnathostome group and exhibit a mosaic of shark- and bony fish-like characters that has long given them prominence in discussions of early gnathostome evolution. Their relationships with modern gnathostomes have remained mysterious, partly because their un-mineralized endoskeletons rarely fossilized. Here I present the first-known braincase of an Early Devonian (approximately 418-412 Myr bp) acanthodian, Ptomacanthus anglicus, and re-evaluate the interrelationships of basal gnathostomes. Acanthodian braincases have previously been represented by a single genus, Acanthodes, which occurs more than 100 million years later in the fossil record. The braincase of Ptomacanthus differs radically from the osteichthyan-like braincase of Acanthodes in exhibiting several plesiomorphic features shared with placoderms and some early chondrichthyans. Most striking is its extremely short sphenoid region and its jaw suspension, which displays features intermediate between some Palaeozoic chondrichthyans and osteichthyans. Phylogenetic analysis resolves Ptomacanthus as either the most basal chondrichthyan or as the sister group of all living gnathostomes. These new data alter earlier conceptions of basal gnathostome phylogeny and thus help to provide a more detailed picture of the acquisition of early gnathostome characters.
1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant because of its widespread use as an industrial solvent, its improper disposal, and its substantial emission to the atmosphere. We report the isolation of an anaerobic bacterium, strain TCA1, that reductively dechlorinates TCA to 1,1-dichloroethane and chloroethane. Strain TCA1 required H2 as an electron donor and TCA as an electron acceptor for growth, indicating that dechlorination is a respiratory process. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain TCA1 is related to gram-positive bacteria with low DNA G+C content and that its closest relative is Dehalobacter restrictus, an obligate H2-oxidizing, chloroethene-respiring bacterium.
Sexual reproduction in many angiosperm plants involves self-incompatibility (SI), which is one of the most important mechanisms to prevent inbreeding. SI is genetically controlled by the S-locus, and involves highly specific interactions during pollination between pollen and the pistil on which it lands. This results in the rejection of incompatible ('self') pollen, whereas compatible ('non-self') pollen is allowed to fertilize the plant. In Papaver rhoeas, S-proteins encoded by the stigma component of the S-locus interact with incompatible pollen, triggering a Ca2+-dependent signalling network, resulting in the inhibition of pollen-tube growth. Programmed cell death (PCD) is a mechanism used by many organisms to destroy unwanted cells in a precisely regulated manner. Here we show that PCD is triggered by SI in an S-specific manner in incompatible pollen. This provides a demonstration of a SI system using PCD, revealing a novel mechanism to prevent self-fertilization. Furthermore, our data reveal that the response is biphasic; rapid inhibition of pollen-tube growth is followed by PCD, which is involved in a later 'decision-making' phase, making inhibition irreversible.
Synchronized oscillations and inhibitory interneurons have important and interconnected roles within cortical microcircuits. In particular, interneurons defined by the fast-spiking phenotype and expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin have been suggested to be involved in gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations, which are hypothesized to enhance information processing. However, because parvalbumin interneurons cannot be selectively controlled, definitive tests of their functional significance in gamma oscillations, and quantitative assessment of the impact of parvalbumin interneurons and gamma oscillations on cortical circuits, have been lacking despite potentially enormous significance (for example, abnormalities in parvalbumin interneurons may underlie altered gamma-frequency synchronization and cognition in schizophrenia and autism). Here we use a panel of optogenetic technologies in mice to selectively modulate multiple distinct circuit elements in neocortex, alone or in combination. We find that inhibiting parvalbumin interneurons suppresses gamma oscillations in vivo, whereas driving these interneurons (even by means of non-rhythmic principal cell activity) is sufficient to generate emergent gamma-frequency rhythmicity. Moreover, gamma-frequency modulation of excitatory input in turn was found to enhance signal transmission in neocortex by reducing circuit noise and amplifying circuit signals, including inputs to parvalbumin interneurons. As demonstrated here, optogenetics opens the door to a new kind of informational analysis of brain function, permitting quantitative delineation of the functional significance of individual elements in the emergent operation and function of intact neural circuitry.
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a severe brain demyelinating disease in boys that is caused by a deficiency in ALD protein, an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter encoded by the ABCD1 gene. ALD progression can be halted by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We initiated a gene therapy trial in two ALD patients for whom there were no matched donors. Autologous CD34+ cells were removed from the patients, genetically corrected ex vivo with a lentiviral vector encoding wild-type ABCD1, and then re-infused into the patients after they had received myeloablative treatment. Over a span of 24 to 30 months of follow-up, we detected polyclonal reconstitution, with 9 to 14% of granulocytes, monocytes, and T and B lymphocytes expressing the ALD protein. These results strongly suggest that hematopoietic stem cells were transduced in the patients. Beginning 14 to 16 months after infusion of the genetically corrected cells, progressive cerebral demyelination in the two patients stopped, a clinical outcome comparable to that achieved by allogeneic HCT. Thus, lentiviral-mediated gene therapy of hematopoietic stem cells can provide clinical benefits in ALD.
The mechanical environment crucially influences many cell functions. However, it remains largely mysterious how mechanical stimuli are transmitted into biochemical signals. Src is known to regulate the integrin-cytoskeleton interaction, which is essential for the transduction of mechanical stimuli. Using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET), here we develop a genetically encoded Src reporter that enables the imaging and quantification of spatio-temporal activation of Src in live cells. We introduced a local mechanical stimulation to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by applying laser-tweezer traction on fibronectin-coated beads adhering to the cells. Using the Src reporter, we observed a rapid distal Src activation and a slower directional wave propagation of Src activation along the plasma membrane. This wave propagated away from the stimulation site with a speed (mean +/- s.e.m.) of 18.1 +/- 1.7 nm s(-1). This force-induced directional and long-range activation of Src was abolished by the disruption of actin filaments or microtubules. Our reporter has thus made it possible to monitor mechanotransduction in live cells with spatio-temporal characterization. We find that the transmission of mechanically induced Src activation is a dynamic process that directs signals via the cytoskeleton to spatial destinations.
Exposed bedrocks at Meridiani Planum on Mars display chemical and mineralogical evidence suggesting interaction with liquid water. On the basis of morphological observations as well as high abundances of haematite and sulphate minerals, the rocks have been interpreted as sediments that were deposited in a shallow body of briny water with subsequent evaporation leaving behind the sulphate minerals. The iron-sulphur mineralization at Meridiani has also been inferred to be analogous to that produced during oxidative weathering of metal sulphide minerals, such as occurs at acid mine drainage sites. Neither of these interpretations, however, is consistent with the chemical composition of the rocks. Here we propose an alternative model for diagenesis of Meridiani bedrock that involves deposition of volcanic ash followed by reaction with condensed sulphur dioxide- and water-bearing vapours emitted from fumaroles. This scenario does not require prolonged interaction with a standing body of surface water and may have occurred at high temperatures. Consequently, the model invokes an environment considerably less favourable for biological activity on Mars than previously proposed interpretations.
Neurospora crassa is a central organism in the history of twentieth-century genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology. Here, we report a high-quality draft sequence of the N. crassa genome. The approximately 40-megabase genome encodes about 10,000 protein-coding genes--more than twice as many as in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and only about 25% fewer than in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of the gene set yields insights into unexpected aspects of Neurospora biology including the identification of genes potentially associated with red light photobiology, genes implicated in secondary metabolism, and important differences in Ca2+ signalling as compared with plants and animals. Neurospora possesses the widest array of genome defence mechanisms known for any eukaryotic organism, including a process unique to fungi called repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Genome analysis suggests that RIP has had a profound impact on genome evolution, greatly slowing the creation of new genes through genomic duplication and resulting in a genome with an unusually low proportion of closely related genes.
Hundreds of murine dilute mutations have been identified and analysed, making dilute one of the best genetically characterized of all mammalian loci. The recessive dilute (d) coat colour mutation carried by many inbred strains of mice produces a lightening of coat colour, caused by an abnormal adendritic melanocyte morphology that results in an uneven release of pigment granules into the developing hair shaft. Most dilute alleles (dilute-lethal) also produce a neurological defect, characterized by convulsions and opisthotonus, apparent at 8-10 days of age and continuing until the death of the animal at 2-3 weeks of age. The discovery that the original dilute allele (now termed dilute-viral or dV) is the result of the integration of an ecotropic murine leukaemia provirus has allowed the cloning of genomic DNA and in this study complementary DNA, from the dilute locus. The predicted dilute amino-acid sequence indicates that dilute encodes a novel type of myosin heavy chain, with a tail, or C-terminal, region that has elements of both type II (alpha-helical coiled-coil) and type I (non-coiled-coil) myosin heavy chains. Dilute transcripts are differentially expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues and are very abundant in neurons of the central nervous system, cephalic ganglia, and spinal ganglia. These results suggest an important role for the dilute gene product in the elaboration, maintenance, or function of cellular processes of melanocytes and neurons.
Evidence has been cited which indicates that RNA and DNA are present in plastids and mitochondria. A multigenic apparatus in the plastid is deduced from the properties of bleached Euglena strains. Control mechanisms are present for the differentiation of proplastids to chloroplasts in Euglena and in higher plants, and for the differentiation of promitochondria to mitochondria in yeast. An operon-regulator mechanism for this control is suggested. A comparison of the hereditary cytoplasmic units of Euglena plastids and yeast mitochondria indicates cates great similarities in their properties. Because of these similarities in two unrelated organisms, we suggest that a DNA unit which is self-duplicating and which serves as a code for RNA is the basic hereditary unit of each plastid and mitochondrion. Much work must be done if this reasonable hypothesis is to be converted into well-founded theory. Some pressing problems await solution. We do not understand the nonrandom distribution of plastids in the mitotic divisions of variegated plants. A related unresolved problem is that of maternal inheritance, in which nonrandom segregation of cytoplasmic organelles occurs after fertilization, causing elimination of the organelles which are contributed by the male parent. How different are the gene components of one plastid in a cell from the gene components of other plastids in the same cell, and how do we test for these differences? Can gene exchange or recombination occur between organelles within the same cell? The answers to these questions may have to await development of more sophisticated techniques, such as the ability to transplant these organelles between different cells or to culture cellular organelles in vitro.
Although mutations that activate the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway have been linked to several types of cancer, the molecular and cellular basis of Hh's ability to induce tumour formation is not well understood. We identified a mutation in patched (ptc), an inhibitor of Hh signalling, in a genetic screen for regulators of the Retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway in Drosophila. Here we show that Hh signalling promotes transcription of Cyclin E and Cyclin D, two inhibitors of Rb, and principal regulators of the cell cycle during development in Drosophila. Upregulation of Cyclin E expression, accomplished through binding of Cubitus interruptus (Ci) to the Cyclin E promoter, mediates the ability of Hh to induce DNA replication. Upregulation of Cyclin D expression by Hh mediates the distinct ability of Hh to promote cellular growth. The discovery of a direct connection between Hh signalling and principal cell-cycle regulators provides insight into the mechanism by which deregulated Hh signalling promotes tumour formation.
New fossils of the giant African crocodyliform Sarcosuchus imperator clarify its skeletal anatomy, growth patterns, size, longevity, and phylogenetic position. The skull has an expansive narial bulla and elongate jaws studded with stout, smooth crowns that do not interlock. The jaw form suggests a generalized diet of large vertebrates, including fish and dinosaurs. S. imperator is estimated to have grown to a maximum body length of at least 11 to 12 meters and body weight of about 8 metric tons over a life-span of 50 to 60 years. Unlike its closest relatives, which lived as specialized piscivores in marginal marine habitats, S. imperator thrived in fluvial environments.
For all their high profile, US biotechnology companies in genetics do not yet seem to offer a stable career, because of uncertainties about corporate performance. Meanwhile, attempts are being made to assess the future shape of genetic counselling services, and to attract non-biologists to genome research.
Type I myosins are thought to drive actin-dependent membrane motility, but the direct demonstration in vivo of their involvement in specific cellular processes has been difficult. Deletion of the genes MYO3 and MYO5, which encode the yeast type I myosins, almost abolished growth. A double-deleted mutant complemented with a MYO5 temperature-sensitive allele (myo5-1) showed a strong defect in the internalization step of receptor-mediated endocytosis, whereas the secretory pathway remained apparently unaffected. Thus, myosin I activity is required for a budding event in endocytosis but not for several other aspects of membrane traffic.
The receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a 170,000-180,000 molecular weight single-chain glycoprotein of 1,186 amino acids. Its sequence suggests that it has an external EGF-binding domain, formed by the NH2-terminal 621 amino acids, linked to a cytoplasmic region by a single membrane-spanning segment. In the cytoplasmic portion, starting 50 residues from the membrane, there is a 250-residue stretch similar to the catalytic domain of the src gene family of retroviral tyrosine protein kinases, and, indeed, a tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity intrinsic to the receptor is stimulated when EGF is bound. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, detected in A431 cells following EGF binding, may be important in the mitogenic signal pathway. Tumour promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), counteract this increase, as well as causing loss of a high affinity class of EGF binding sites. The major receptor for TPA has been identified as the serine/threonine-specific Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent diacylglycerol-activated protein kinase, protein kinase C. By substituting for diacylglycerol, TPA stimulates protein kinase C. Protein kinase C phosphorylates purified EGF receptor at specific sites, and this reduces EGF-stimulated tyrosine protein kinase activity. TPA treatment of A431 cells increases serine and threonine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at the same sites, which suggests that the reduction of EGF receptor kinase activity in TPA-treated cells is a consequence of the receptor's phosphorylation by the kinase. We have attempted to identify these phosphorylation sites and show here that protein kinase C phosphorylates threonine 654 in the human EGF receptor. This threonine is in a very basic sequence nine residues from the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane in the region before the protein kinase domain; it is thus in a position to modulate signalling between this internal domain and the external EGF-binding domain.
We have identified cobalt-base superalloys showing a high-temperature strength greater than those of conventional nickel-base superalloys. The cobalt-base alloys are strengthened by a ternary compound with the L1(2) structure, gamma' Co3(Al,W), which precipitates in the disordered gamma face-centered cubic cobalt matrix with high coherency and with high melting points. We also identified a ternary compound, gamma' Ir3(Al,W), with the L1(2) structure, which suggests that the Co-Ir-Al-W-base systems with gamma+gamma' (Co,Ir)3(Al,W) structures offer great promise as candidates for next-generation high-temperature materials.
Marine unicellular cyanobacteria are responsible for an estimated 20-40% of chlorophyll biomass and carbon fixation in the oceans. Here we have sequenced and analysed the 2.4-megabase genome of Synechococcus sp. strain WH8102, revealing some of the ways that these organisms have adapted to their largely oligotrophic environment. WH8102 uses organic nitrogen and phosphorus sources and more sodium-dependent transporters than a model freshwater cyanobacterium. Furthermore, it seems to have adopted strategies for conserving limited iron stores by using nickel and cobalt in some enzymes, has reduced its regulatory machinery (consistent with the fact that the open ocean constitutes a far more constant and buffered environment than fresh water), and has evolved a unique type of swimming motility. The genome of WH8102 seems to have been greatly influenced by horizontal gene transfer, partially through phages. The genetic material contributed by horizontal gene transfer includes genes involved in the modification of the cell surface and in swimming motility. On the basis of its genome, WH8102 is more of a generalist than two related marine cyanobacteria.
Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness showed how natural selection could lead to behaviors that decrease the relative fitness of the actor and also either benefit (altruism) or harm (spite) other individuals. However, several fundamental issues in the evolution of altruism and spite have remained contentious. Here, we show how recent work has resolved three key debates, helping clarify how Hamilton's theoretical overview links to real-world examples, in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans: Is the evolution of extreme altruism, represented by the sterile workers of social insects, driven by genetics or ecology? Does spite really exist in nature? And, can altruism be favored between individuals who are not close kin but share a "greenbeard" gene for altruism?
Economical methods by which gene function may be analysed on a genomic scale are relatively scarce. To fill this need, we have developed a transposon-tagging strategy for the genome-wide analysis of disruption phenotypes, gene expression and protein localization, and have applied this method to the large-scale analysis of gene function in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we present the largest collection of defined yeast mutants ever generated within a single genetic background--a collection of over 11,000 strains, each carrying a transposon inserted within a region of the genome expressed during vegetative growth and/or sporulation. These insertions affect nearly 2,000 annotated genes, representing about one-third of the 6,200 predicted genes in the yeast genome. We have used this collection to determine disruption phenotypes for nearly 8,000 strains using 20 different growth conditions; the resulting data sets were clustered to identify groups of functionally related genes. We have also identified over 300 previously non-annotated open reading frames and analysed by indirect immunofluorescence over 1,300 transposon-tagged proteins. In total, our study encompasses over 260,000 data points, constituting the largest functional analysis of the yeast genome ever undertaken.
The CTF/NF-I group of cellular DNA binding proteins recognizes the sequence GCCAAT and is implicated in eukaryotic transcription as well as DNA replication. Molecular analysis of human CTF/NF-I complementary DNA clones reveals multiple messenger RNA species containing alternative coding regions, apparently as a result of differential splicing. Expression and functional analysis establish that individual gene products can bind to GCCAAT recognition sites and serve both as promoter-selective transcriptional activators and as initiation factors for DNA replication.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are childhood neurodevelopmental disorders with complex genetic origins. Previous studies focusing on candidate genes or genomic regions have identified several copy number variations (CNVs) that are associated with an increased risk of ASDs. Here we present the results from a whole-genome CNV study on a cohort of 859 ASD cases and 1,409 healthy children of European ancestry who were genotyped with approximately 550,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, in an attempt to comprehensively identify CNVs conferring susceptibility to ASDs. Positive findings were evaluated in an independent cohort of 1,336 ASD cases and 1,110 controls of European ancestry. Besides previously reported ASD candidate genes, such as NRXN1 (ref. 10) and CNTN4 (refs 11, 12), several new susceptibility genes encoding neuronal cell-adhesion molecules, including NLGN1 and ASTN2, were enriched with CNVs in ASD cases compared to controls (P = 9.5 x 10(-3)). Furthermore, CNVs within or surrounding genes involved in the ubiquitin pathways, including UBE3A, PARK2, RFWD2 and FBXO40, were affected by CNVs not observed in controls (P = 3.3 x 10(-3)). We also identified duplications 55 kilobases upstream of complementary DNA AK123120 (P = 3.6 x 10(-6)). Although these variants may be individually rare, they target genes involved in neuronal cell-adhesion or ubiquitin degradation, indicating that these two important gene networks expressed within the central nervous system may contribute to the genetic susceptibility of ASD.
Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis involves sequential morphological and biochemical changes and is regulated by specific genes (spo genes) estimated to occupy more than 30 loci. A mutation in any one of these genes blocks the sporulation process at the corresponding developmental stage. Despite intensive genetic studies, the nature and function of the spo gene products remain unknown. Vegetative B. subtilis RNA polymerase core enzyme may interact with several sigma factors and discriminate among different classes of promoters. During sporulation, new polypeptides are associated with the core enzyme which may have a central role in modifying its promoter recognition specificity. As a first step to understanding their function in the switch from vegetative to sporulation mode, several early sporulation genes have been cloned and analysed. Here we report the cloning and nucleotide sequence of the spoIIG gene of B. subtilis. This gene encodes a polypeptide with a predicted relative molecular mass of 27,652 which contains a 65-amino acid region highly homologous to an internal part of the Escherichia coli sigma factor.
In the congenital long-QT syndrome, prolongation of the cardiac action potential occurs by an unknown mechanism and predisposes individuals to syncope and sudden death as a result of ventricular arrhythmias. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for autosomal dominant long-QT syndrome by the identification of multiple distinct loci, and associated mutations in two candidate genes have recently been reported. One form of hereditary long QT (LQT3) has been linked to a mutation in the gene encoding the human heart voltage-gated sodium-channel alpha-subunit (SCN5A on chromosome 3p21). Here we characterize this mutation using heterologous expression of recombinant human heart sodium channels. Mutant channels show a sustained inward current during membrane depolarization. Single-channel recordings indicate that mutant channels fluctuate between normal and non-inactivating gating modes. Persistent inward sodium current explains prolongation of cardiac action potentials, and provides a molecular mechanism for this form of congenital long-QT syndrome.
Spinal muscular atrophy is one of the most common inherited forms of neurological disease leading to infant mortality. Patients have selective loss of lower motor neurons resulting in muscle weakness, paralysis and often death. Although patient fibroblasts have been used extensively to study spinal muscular atrophy, motor neurons have a unique anatomy and physiology which may underlie their vulnerability to the disease process. Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from skin fibroblast samples taken from a child with spinal muscular atrophy. These cells expanded robustly in culture, maintained the disease genotype and generated motor neurons that showed selective deficits compared to those derived from the child's unaffected mother. This is the first study to show that human induced pluripotent stem cells can be used to model the specific pathology seen in a genetically inherited disease. As such, it represents a promising resource to study disease mechanisms, screen new drug compounds and develop new therapies.
The genetic control of courtship song differences between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans males was investigated by producing hybrids from reciprocal crosses. The song rhythm difference between the parental species appears to be due to sex-linked genes, whereas the basic interpulse-interval difference is autosomally inherited. Hybrid females show selective preferences for artificially generated songs carrying intermediate "hybrid" characteristics.
Crania of 'anatomically modern' Homo sapiens from the Holocene and Upper Pleistocene epochs differ from those of other Homo taxa, including Neanderthals, by only a few features. These include a globular braincase, a vertical forehead, a dimunitive browridge, a canine fossa and a pronounced chin. Humans are also unique among mammals in lacking facial projection: the face of the adult H. sapiens lies almost entirely beneath the anterior cranial fossa, whereas the face in all other adult mammals, including Neanderthals, projects to some extent in front of the braincase. Here I use radiographs and computed tomography to show that many of these unique human features stem partly from a single, ontogenetically early reduction in the length of the sphenoid, the central bone of the cranial base from which the face grows forward. Sphenoid reduction, through its effects on facial projection and cranial shape, may account for the apparently rapid evolution of modern human cranial form, and suggests that Neanderthals and other archaic Homo should be excluded from H. sapiens.
Phototransduction is the process by which light-stimulated photoreceptor cells of the visual system send electrical signals to the nervous system. Many of the steps that follow the initial event in phototransduction, absorption of light by rhodopsin, are ill-defined. The fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, provides a means to dissect phototransduction genetically. Mutations such as transient receptor potential (trp) affect intermediate steps in phototransduction. In order to facilitate molecular studies of phototransduction, the trp gene was isolated and its identity was confirmed by complementing the mutant trpCM allele of the trp gene by P-element mediated germline transformation of a 7.1-kilobase DNA fragment. Expression of the trp gene begins late in pupal development and appears to be limited to the eyes and ocelli.
Although it is widely accepted that the plastids of plants and algae originated as endosymbionts, the details of this evolutionary process are unclear. It has been proposed that in organisms whose plastids are surrounded by more than two membranes, the endosymbiont was a eukaryotic alga rather than a photosynthetic prokaryote. The DNA-containing nucleomorph of cryptomonad algae appears to be the vestigial nucleus of such an algal endosymbiont. Eukaryotic-type ribosomal RNA sequences have been localized to a nucleolus-like structure in the nucleomorph. In support of the hypothesis that cryptomonads are evolutionary chimaeras of two distinct eukaryotic cells, we show here that Cryptomonas phi contains two phylogenetically separate, nuclear-type small-subunit rRNA genes, both of which are transcriptionally active. We incorporate our rRNA sequence data into phylogenetic trees, from which we infer the evolutionary ancestry of the host and symbiont components of Cryptomonas phi. Such trees do not support the thesis that chromophyte algae evolved directly from a cryptomonad-like ancestor.
Dorsal-ventral patterning in vertebrate and invertebrate embryos is mediated by a conserved system of secreted proteins that establishes a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) gradient. Although the Drosophila embryonic Decapentaplegic (Dpp) gradient has served as a model to understand how morphogen gradients are established, no role for the extracellular matrix has been previously described. Here we show that type IV collagen extracellular matrix proteins bind Dpp and regulate its signalling in both the Drosophila embryo and ovary. We provide evidence that the interaction between Dpp and type IV collagen augments Dpp signalling in the embryo by promoting gradient formation, yet it restricts the signalling range in the ovary through sequestration of the Dpp ligand. Together, these results identify a critical function of type IV collagens in modulating Dpp in the extracellular space during Drosophila development. On the basis of our findings that human type IV collagen binds BMP4, we predict that this role of type IV collagens will be conserved.
The Caenorhabditis elegans genome sequence was surveyed for transcription factor and signaling gene families that have been shown to regulate development in a variety of species. About 10 to 25 percent of the genes in most of the gene families already have been genetically analyzed in C. elegans, about half of the genes detect probable orthologs in other species, and about 10 to 25 percent of the genes are, at present, unique to C. elegans. Caenorhabditis elegans is also missing genes that are found in vertebrates and other invertebrates. Thus the genome sequence reveals universals in developmental control that are the legacy of metazoan complexity before the Cambrian explosion, as well as genes that have been more recently invented or lost in particular phylogenetic lineages.
Brain-machine interfaces use neuronal activity recorded from the brain to establish direct communication with external actuators, such as prosthetic arms. It is hoped that brain-machine interfaces can be used to restore the normal sensorimotor functions of the limbs, but so far they have lacked tactile sensation. Here we report the operation of a brain-machine-brain interface (BMBI) that both controls the exploratory reaching movements of an actuator and allows signalling of artificial tactile feedback through intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex. Monkeys performed an active exploration task in which an actuator (a computer cursor or a virtual-reality arm) was moved using a BMBI that derived motor commands from neuronal ensemble activity recorded in the primary motor cortex. ICMS feedback occurred whenever the actuator touched virtual objects. Temporal patterns of ICMS encoded the artificial tactile properties of each object. Neuronal recordings and ICMS epochs were temporally multiplexed to avoid interference. Two monkeys operated this BMBI to search for and distinguish one of three visually identical objects, using the virtual-reality arm to identify the unique artificial texture associated with each. These results suggest that clinical motor neuroprostheses might benefit from the addition of ICMS feedback to generate artificial somatic perceptions associated with mechanical, robotic or even virtual prostheses.
Class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) consist of two glycosylated, membrane-integrated polypeptide chains. These cell surface-expressed molecules are involved in several immunobiological events involving cell-cell interactions, most of which seem to require that genetically identical class II antigens, or other molecules controlled by the same region of the MHC, are expressed on the interacting cells. The extensive genetic polymorphism of the class II antigens has rendered analyses in the human system of the number of non-allelic species of class II antigens difficult, although several laboratories have reported the existence of at least two types of human class II antigens. Here we present the results of experiments using restriction enzyme digestions and separation of DNA from individuals homozygous for the MHC followed by hybridization to human class II antigen alpha- and beta-chain cDNA probes. While the alpha-chain probe gave only a single hybridization band, the various beta-chain probes revealed a more complex pattern that is consistent with the existence of at least three separate beta-chain genes or pseudogenes in the human MHC.
For many years, discoveries about the genetic determinants of cancer appeared to be having only minor effects on efforts to control the disease in the clinic. Following advances made over the past decade, however, a description of cancer in molecular terms seems increasingly likely to improve the ways in which human cancers are detected, classified, monitored, and (especially) treated. Achieving the medical promise of this new era in cancer research will require a deeper understanding of the biology of cancer and imaginative application of new knowledge in the clinic, as well as political, social, and cultural changes.
The murine retinal degeneration slow (rds) gene is a semidominant mutation with a phenotype having rod and cone photoreceptors that develop abnormally and then slowly degenerate. The phenotype is a possible model for retinitis pigmentosa, one of the scores of hereditary human retinal degenerations, which is also characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. We report here three mutations of the human homologue of the rds gene (RDS) that cosegregate with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa in separate families. Our results indicate that some cases of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa are due to mutations at the RDS locus.
Apoptosis is a phenomenon observed during development of many cell types in many organisms. It is an internal, programmed cell death characterized by DNA fragmentation into nucleosome-size pieces. Anti-CD3-induced apoptosis in T-cell hybridomas and immature thymocytes requires new gene transcription and may be related to negative selection during T-cell development. Using subtractive hybridization, we isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding the orphan steroid receptor Nur77 (refs 7-9). It shows different patterns of messenger RNA induction between apoptotic and stimulated T cells. We report here the use of gel shift analysis to demonstrate that the Nur77 protein is present at high levels in apoptotic T-cell hybridomas and apoptotic thymocytes, but not in growing T cells or stimulated splenocytes. A Nur77 dominant negative protected T-cell hybridomas from activation-induced apoptosis. Hence Nur77 is necessary for induced apoptosis in T-cell hybridomas.
A pathway database (DB) is a DB that describes biochemical pathways, reactions, and enzymes. The EcoCyc pathway DB (see http://ecocyc.org) describes the metabolic, transport, and genetic-regulatory networks of Escherichia coli. EcoCyc is an example of a computational symbolic theory, which is a DB that structures a scientific theory within a formal ontology so that it is available for computational analysis. It is argued that by encoding scientific theories in symbolic form, we open new realms of analysis and understanding for theories that would otherwise be too large and complex for scientists to reason with effectively.
Most of what is known about the evolution of deinonychosaurs (that is, the group of theropods most closely related to birds) is based on discoveries from North America and Asia. Except for Unenlagia comahuensis and some fragmentary remains from northern Africa, no other evidence was available on deinonychosaurian diversity in Gondwana. Here we report a new, Late Cretaceous member of the clade, Neuquenraptor argentinus gen. et sp. nov., representing uncontroversial evidence of a deinonychosaurian theropod in the Southern Hemisphere. The new discovery demonstrates that Cretaceous theropod faunas from the southern continents shared greater similarity with those of the northern landmasses than previously thought. Available evidence suggests that deinonychosaurians were probably distributed worldwide at least by the beginning of the Cretaceous period. The phylogenetic position of the new deinonychosaur, as well as other Patagonian coelurosaurian theropods, is compatible with a vicariance model of diversification for some groups of Gondwanan and Laurasian dinosaurs.
Receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands mediate cell-cell communication and interaction in many organ systems, but have not been known to act in this capacity in the mature immune system. We now provide genetic evidence that three closely related receptor tyrosine kinases, Tyro 3, Axl, and Mer, play an essential immunoregulatory role. Mutant mice that lack these receptors develop a severe lymphoproliferative disorder accompanied by broad-spectrum autoimmunity. These phenotypes are cell nonautonomous with respect to lymphocytes and result from the hyperactivation of antigen-presenting cells in which the three receptors are normally expressed.
The mammalian heart has a very limited regenerative capacity and, hence, heals by scar formation. Recent reports suggest that haematopoietic stem cells can transdifferentiate into unexpected phenotypes such as skeletal muscle, hepatocytes, epithelial cells, neurons, endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, in response to tissue injury or placement in a new environment. Furthermore, transplanted human hearts contain myocytes derived from extra-cardiac progenitor cells, which may have originated from bone marrow. Although most studies suggest that transdifferentiation is extremely rare under physiological conditions, extensive regeneration of myocardial infarcts was reported recently after direct stem cell injection, prompting several clinical trials. Here, we used both cardiomyocyte-restricted and ubiquitously expressed reporter transgenes to track the fate of haematopoietic stem cells after 145 transplants into normal and injured adult mouse hearts. No transdifferentiation into cardiomyocytes was detectable when using these genetic techniques to follow cell fate, and stem-cell-engrafted hearts showed no overt increase in cardiomyocytes compared to sham-engrafted hearts. These results indicate that haematopoietic stem cells do not readily acquire a cardiac phenotype, and raise a cautionary note for clinical studies of infarct repair.
The expansion of modern human populations in Africa 80,000 to 60,000 years ago and their initial exodus out of Africa have been tentatively linked to two phases of technological and behavioral innovation within the Middle Stone Age of southern Africa-the Still Bay and Howieson's Poort industries-that are associated with early evidence for symbols and personal ornaments. Establishing the correct sequence of events, however, has been hampered by inadequate chronologies. We report ages for nine sites from varied climatic and ecological zones across southern Africa that show that both industries were short-lived (5000 years or less), separated by about 7000 years, and coeval with genetic estimates of population expansion and exit times. Comparison with climatic records shows that these bursts of innovative behavior cannot be explained by environmental factors alone.
The interactions between enhancers and promotor elements that control gene expression are generally considered to act in cis only, but genetic studies suggest that they can also function in trans between non-contiguous DNA molecules. Termed transvection, such trans interactions have been proposed to be responsible for several examples of intragenic complementation in Drosophila. Transvection is thought to depend on the physical proximity of sister chromosomes, because it is inhibited when chromosome rearrangements reduce the pairing of homologues. This led to the suggestion that transvection occurs when enhancer elements on one chromosome regulate expression on the other, with the pairing dependence resulting from a need for proximity between the two copies of the gene. Here we have analysed the levels of transcription from both alleles of the Drosophila Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene, and report that the predictions of this simple model are not supported. Our findings indicate a more complex level of trans regulation that may have implications for the aetiology of genetic disorders that are influenced by chromosome rearrangements.
Sensory maps in neocortex are adaptively altered to reflect recent experience and learning. In somatosensory cortex, distinct patterns of sensory use or disuse elicit multiple, functionally distinct forms of map plasticity. Diverse approaches-genetics, synaptic and in vivo physiology, optical imaging, and ultrastructural analysis-suggest a distributed model in which plasticity occurs at multiple sites in the cortical circuit with multiple cellular/synaptic mechanisms and multiple likely learning rules for plasticity. This view contrasts with the classical model in which the map plasticity reflects a single Hebbian process acting at a small set of cortical synapses.
Diatoms are encased in an intricately patterned wall that consists of amorphous silica. Species-specific fabrication of this ornate biomineral enables taxonomists to identify thousands of diatom species. The molecular mechanisms that control this nanofabrication and generate the diversity of patterns is not well understood. A simple model is described, in which repeated phase separation events during wall biogenesis are assumed to produce self-similar silica patterns in smaller and smaller scales. On the basis of this single assumption, the apparently complex patterns found in the valves of the diatom genus Coscinodiscus can be predicted. Microscopic analysis of valves in statu nascendi from three different Coscinodiscus species supports the conclusions derived from the model.
Resistance to antibiotics is increasing in some groups of clinically important pathogens. For instance, high vancomycin resistance has emerged in enterococci. Promising alternative antibiotics are the peptide antibiotics, abundant in host defense systems, which kill their targets by permeabilizing the plasma membrane. These peptides generally do not act via specific receptors and are active in the micromolar range. Here it is shown that vancomycin and the antibacterial peptide nisin Z use the same target: the membrane-anchored cell wall precursor Lipid II. Nisin combines high affinity for Lipid II with its pore-forming ability, thus causing the peptide to be highly active (in the nanomolar range).
Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium swim by rotating their flagella, each of which consists of an external helical filament and a rotary motor embedded in the cell surface. The function of the flagellar motor has been examined mainly by tethering the flagellar filament to a glass slide and observing the resultant rotation of the cell body. But under these conditions the motor operates at a very low speed (about 10 r.p.s.) owing to the unnaturally high load conditions inherent in this technique. Lowe et al. analysed the frequency of light scattered from swimming cells to estimate the average rotation speed of flagellar bundles of E. coli as about 270 r.p.s. To analyse motor function in more detail, however, measurement of high-speed rotation of a single flagellum (at low load) with a temporal resolution better than 1 ms is needed. We have now developed a new method--laser dark-field microscopy--which fulfils these requirements. We find that although the average rotation speed of S. typhimurium flagella is rather stable, there are occasional abrupt slowdowns, pauses and reversals (accomplished within 1 ms). These changes were frequently observed in mutants defective in one of the motor components (called the switch complex), suggesting that this component is important not only in switching rotational direction but also in torque generation or regulation.
Widespread loss of cerebral connectivity is assumed to underlie the failure of brain mechanisms that support communication and goal-directed behaviour following severe traumatic brain injury. Disorders of consciousness that persist for longer than 12 months after severe traumatic brain injury are generally considered to be immutable; no treatment has been shown to accelerate recovery or improve functional outcome in such cases. Recent studies have shown unexpected preservation of large-scale cerebral networks in patients in the minimally conscious state (MCS), a condition that is characterized by intermittent evidence of awareness of self or the environment. These findings indicate that there might be residual functional capacity in some patients that could be supported by therapeutic interventions. We hypothesize that further recovery in some patients in the MCS is limited by chronic underactivation of potentially recruitable large-scale networks. Here, in a 6-month double-blind alternating crossover study, we show that bilateral deep brain electrical stimulation (DBS) of the central thalamus modulates behavioural responsiveness in a patient who remained in MCS for 6 yr following traumatic brain injury before the intervention. The frequency of specific cognitively mediated behaviours (primary outcome measures) and functional limb control and oral feeding (secondary outcome measures) increased during periods in which DBS was on as compared with periods in which it was off. Logistic regression modelling shows a statistical linkage between the observed functional improvements and recent stimulation history. We interpret the DBS effects as compensating for a loss of arousal regulation that is normally controlled by the frontal lobe in the intact brain. These findings provide evidence that DBS can promote significant late functional recovery from severe traumatic brain injury. Our observations, years after the injury occurred, challenge the existing practice of early treatment discontinuation for patients with only inconsistent interactive behaviours and motivate further research to develop therapeutic interventions.
Information from the human genome sequence will eventually alter many aspects of clinical practice. It will increase through our understanding of disease mechanisms, and guide the development of new drugs and therapeutic procedures. In the short term, however, knowledge of the genome will have a profound clinical impact on the diagnostic capability of clinical genetics laboratories. Molecular phenotyping using genetic and genomic information will allow early and more accurate prediction and diagnosis of disease and of disease progression. Medicine will become oriented towards disease prevention rather than efforts to cure people at late stages of illness.
In Drosophila, five "terminal" polarity genes must be active in females in order for them to produce embryos with normal anterior and posterior ends. Hypoactivity mutations in one such gene, torso, result in the loss of the most posterior domain of fushi tarazu expression and the terminal cuticular structures. In contrast, a torso hyperactivity mutation causes the loss of central fushi tarazu expression and central cuticular structures. Cytoplasmic leakage, transplantation, and temperature-shift experiments suggest that the latter effect is caused by abnormal persistence of the torso product in the central region of the embryo during early development. Thus, the amount and timing of torso activity is key to distinguishing the central and terminal regions of the embryo. Mutations in the tailless terminal gene act as dominant maternal suppressors of the hyperactive torso allele, indicating that the torso product acts through, or in concert with, the tailless product.
On induction of cell differentiation, distinct cell phenotypes are encoded by complex genetic networks. These networks can prevent the reversion of established phenotypes even in the presence of significant fluctuations. Here we explore the key parameters that determine the stability of cellular memory by using the yeast galactose-signalling network as a model system. This network contains multiple nested feedback loops. Of the two positive feedback loops, only the loop mediated by the cytoplasmic signal transducer Gal3p is able to generate two stable expression states with a persistent memory of previous galactose consumption states. The parallel loop mediated by the galactose transporter Gal2p only increases the expression difference between the two states. A negative feedback through the inhibitor Gal80p reduces the strength of the core positive feedback. Despite this, a constitutive increase in the Gal80p concentration tunes the system from having destabilized memory to having persistent memory. A model reveals that fluctuations are trapped more efficiently at higher Gal80p concentrations. Indeed, the rate at which single cells randomly switch back and forth between expression states was reduced. These observations provide a quantitative understanding of the stability and reversibility of cellular differentiation states.
Mice and cells lacking the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were generated to examine its physiological role in vivo. Mutant fetuses are retarded in growth and die at mid-gestation in a 129/Sv genetic background, whereas in a 129/Sv x C57BL/6 cross some survive until birth and even to postnatal day 20 in a 129/Sv x C57BL/6 x MF1 background. Death in utero probably results from a defect in the spongiotrophoblast layer of the placenta. Newborn mutant mice have open eyes, rudimentary whiskers, immature lungs, and defects in the epidermis, correlating with the expression pattern of the EGFR as monitored by beta-galactosidase activity. These defects are probably cell-autonomous because chimeric mice generated with EGFR-/- embryonic stem cells contribute small amounts of mutant cells to some organs. These results indicate that the EGFR regulates epithelial proliferation and differentiation and that the genetic background influences the resulting phenotype.
Longitudinal studies of patients infected with HIV-1 reveal a long and variable incubation period between infection and the development of AIDS. Data from a small number of infected patients show temporal changes in the number of genetically distinct strains of the virus throughout the incubation period, with a slow but steady rise in diversity during the progression to disease. A mathematical model of the dynamic interaction between viral diversity and the human immune system suggests the existence of an antigen diversity threshold, below which the immune system is able to regulate viral population growth but above which the virus population induces the collapse of the CD4+ lymphocyte population. The model suggests that antigenic diversity is the cause, not a consequence, of immunodeficiency disease. The model is compared with available data, and is used to assess how the timing of the application of chemotherapy or immunotherapy influences the rate of progress to disease.
We investigated the forces that connect the genetic program of development to morphogenesis in Drosophila. We focused on dorsal closure, a powerful model system for development and wound healing. We found that the bulk of progress toward closure is driven by contractility in supracellular "purse strings" and in the amnioserosa, whereas adhesion-mediated zipping coordinates the forces produced by the purse strings and is essential only for the end stages. We applied quantitative modeling to show that these forces, generated in distinct cells, are coordinated in space and synchronized in time. Modeling of wild-type and mutant phenotypes is predictive; although closure in myospheroid mutants ultimately fails when the cell sheets rip themselves apart, our analysis indicates that beta(PS) integrin has an earlier, important role in zipping.
We have purified the human T-cell growth factor (interleukin-2) receptor and have cloned, sequenced and expressed cDNAs corresponding to this receptor. We identify one gene, but two interleukin-2 receptor mRNAs which differ in their polyadenylation signals. We have isolated an additional cDNA that may correspond to an alternatively spliced mRNA that lacks a 216 base segment and appears to encode an altered membrane protein which cannot bind interleukin-2.
CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) maintain immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis by suppressing aberrant or excessive immune responses. The core genetic program of Tregs and their ability to suppress pathologic immune responses depends on the transcription factor Foxp3. Despite progress in understanding mechanisms of Foxp3-dependent gene activation, the molecular mechanism of Foxp3-dependent gene repression remains largely unknown. We identified Eos, a zinc-finger transcription factor of the Ikaros family, as a critical mediator of Foxp3-dependent gene silencing in Tregs. Eos interacts directly with Foxp3 and induces chromatin modifications that result in gene silencing in Tregs. Silencing of Eos in Tregs abrogates their ability to suppress immune responses and endows them with partial effector function, thus demonstrating the critical role that Eos plays in Treg programming.
Whether a human embryo develops as a male or a female is determined by the presence of the Y chromosome. The sex-determining function lies entirely in interval 1A, inasmuch as most XX individuals with descended testes and normal male external genitalia carry this small region of the Y chromosome. We have localized an essential part of the sex-determining function to a portion of interval 1A, on the basis of the discovery of a female with a reciprocal Y;22 translocation and part of 1A deleted at the translocation breakpoint. Recently, a paradox has arisen with the report of four partially masculinized XX individuals who carry only a portion of interval 1A--a portion that does not overlap the deletion in the X,t(Y;22) female. These recent findings imply that the sex-determining function lies in the portion of 1A present in the four XX intersexes and not in the portion deleted in the X,t(Y;22) female. To explain the X,t(Y;22) individual, it was proposed that she was female because of a chromosomal position effect or delayed development of the gonadal soma. Here we report that the X,t(Y;22) female has a deletion of a second portion of interval 1A--a portion corresponding closely to that present in the XX intersexes. This resolves the apparent contradiction. Nonetheless, phenotype-genotype correlations suggest that two or more genetic elements in interval 1A may contribute to the sex-determining function of the Y chromosome. The X,t(Y;22) female lacks the ZFY gene but does not exhibit the complex phenotype known as Turner's syndrome, arguing against the hypothesis that ZFY is the Turner's syndrome gene on the Y chromosome.
Apparently nitrous acid produces genetic alterations, expressed as antibiotic-resistant markers, directly on heat-denatured transforming DNA of Haemophilus influenzae, rather than producing DNA which acts as a non-specific mutagen. The markers which arise as a result of treatment with nitrous acid behave similarly to naturally occurring antibiotic markers. In addition, data comparing the expression and replication of induced markers to natural markers suggest that the nitrous acid-induced markers express and multiply in the same fashion as do "normal" markers. Therefore, mutations which require additional time to produce a functional DNA by a base-pair substitution, or by replication of the introduced DNA, are not responsible for the mutants observed.
Using chromosome heteromorphisms and blood cell types as genetic markers, we demonstrated chimerism in a chi46,XX/46,XY true hermaphrodite. The pattern of inheritance of the chromosome heteromorphisms indicates that this individual was probably conceived by the fertilization, by two different spermatozoa, of an ovum and the second meiotic division polar body derived from the ovum and subsequent fusion of the two zygotes. This conclusion is based on the identification of the same maternal chromosomes 13, 16, and 21 in both the 46,XX and 46,XY cells of the patient. In the two cell lines of the chimera, chromosomal markers showed different paternal No. 9 chromosomes and sex chromosomes, as well as the same paternal chromosome 22.
Gene targeting was used to create a null allele at the epidermal growth factor receptor locus (Egfr). The phenotype was dependent on genetic background. EGFR deficiency on a CF-1 background resulted in peri-implantation death due to degeneration of the inner cell mass. On a 129/Sv background, homozygous mutants died at mid-gestation due to placental defects; on a CD-1 background, the mutants lived for up to 3 weeks and showed abnormalities in skin, kidney, brain, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. The multiple abnormalities associated with EGFR deficiency indicate that the receptor is involved in a wide range of cellular activities.
Kruppel (Kr), one of the zygotically active Drosophila segmentation genes, is expressed in a restricted domain during the blastoderm stage of embryogenesis and is involved in the control of development of the thoracic and abdominal segments of the fly. Kr encodes a polypeptide containing DNA-binding zinc-finger motifs, disruptions of which yield Kr mutants. We have assayed the transcriptional activities of wild-type Kr protein as well as Lac repressor/Kr fusion proteins in HeLa and CV-1 cells. Wild-type Kr and a Lac-Kr chimaeric protein repressed transcription from reporter promoters in which a consensus Kr binding site derived from sequences within the even-skipped promoter had been inserted in an upstream position. We mapped the repression function of Kr to an alanine-rich amino-terminal region of the protein, as a Lac/Kr fusion protein containing only amino acids 26-110 of Kr repressed transcription from a reporter promoter containing upstream lac operators. This demonstrates that the DNA-binding and repression activities of the Kr protein are distinct. These data are consistent with genetic evidence that Kr represses even-skipped and hunchback expression, and suggest that Kr is a negative regulator of transcription in Drosophila.
Features of the physical environment surrounding an ancestral organism can be inferred by reconstructing sequences of ancient proteins made by those organisms, resurrecting these proteins in the laboratory, and measuring their properties. Here, we resurrect candidate sequences for elongation factors of the Tu family (EF-Tu) found at ancient nodes in the bacterial evolutionary tree, and measure their activities as a function of temperature. The ancient EF-Tu proteins have temperature optima of 55-65 degrees C. This value seems to be robust with respect to uncertainties in the ancestral reconstruction. This suggests that the ancient bacteria that hosted these particular genes were thermophiles, and neither hyperthermophiles nor mesophiles. This conclusion can be compared and contrasted with inferences drawn from an analysis of the lengths of branches in trees joining proteins from contemporary bacteria, the distribution of thermophily in derived bacterial lineages, the inferred G + C content of ancient ribosomal RNA, and the geological record combined with assumptions concerning molecular clocks. The study illustrates the use of experimental palaeobiochemistry and assumptions about deep phylogenetic relationships between bacteria to explore the character of ancient life.
The complete DNA sequence of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XI has been determined. In addition to a compact arrangement of potential protein coding sequences, the 666,448-base-pair sequence has revealed general chromosome patterns; in particular, alternating regional variations in average base composition correlate with variations in local gene density along the chromosome. Significant discrepancies with the previously published genetic map demonstrate the need for using independent physical mapping criteria.
Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are macroglial cells of the vertebrate central nervous system. These cells have diverse roles in the maintenance of neurological function. In the embryo, the genetic mechanisms that underlie the specification of macroglial precursors in vivo appear strikingly similar to those that regulate the development of the diverse neuron types. The switch from producing neuronal to glial subtype-specific precursors can be modelled as an interplay between region-restricted components and temporal regulators that determine neurogenic or gliogenic phases of development, contributing to glial diversity. Gaining insight into the developmental genetics of macroglia has great potential to improve our understanding of a variety of neurological disorders in humans.
Pyrrolysine, the twenty-second amino acid found to be encoded in the natural genetic code, is necessary for all of the known pathways by which methane is formed from methylamines. Pyrrolysine comprises a methylated pyrroline carboxylate in amide linkage to the e-amino group of L-lysine. In certain Archaea, three methyltransferases initiate methanogenesis from the various methylamines, and these enzymes are encoded by genes with an in-frame amber codon that is translated as pyrrolysine. Escherichia coli that has been transformed with the pylTSBCD genes from methanogenic Archaea can incorporate endogenously biosynthesized pyrrolysine into proteins. The decoding of UAG as pyrrolysine requires pylT, which produces tRNA(Pyl) (also called tRNA(CUA)), and pylS, which encodes a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase. The pylB, pylC and pylD genes are each required for tRNA-independent pyrrolysine synthesis. Pyrrolysine is the last remaining genetically encoded amino acid with an unknown biosynthetic pathway. Here we provide genetic and mass spectrometric evidence for a pylBCD-dependent pathway in which pyrrolysine arises from two lysines. We show that a newly uncovered UAG-encoded amino acid, desmethylpyrrolysine, is made from lysine and exogenous D-ornithine in a pylC-dependent process followed by a pylD-dependent process, but it is not further converted to pyrrolysine. These results indicate that the radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) protein PylB mediates a lysine mutase reaction that produces 3-methylornithine, which is then ligated to a second molecule of lysine by PylC before oxidation by PylD results in pyrrolysine. The discovery of lysine as the sole precursor to pyrrolysine will further inform discussions of the evolution of the genetic code and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, intermediates of the pathway may provide new avenues by which the pyl system can be exploited to produce recombinant proteins with useful modified residues.
Supergenes are tight clusters of loci that facilitate the co-segregation of adaptive variation, providing integrated control of complex adaptive phenotypes. Polymorphic supergenes, in which specific combinations of traits are maintained within a single population, were first described for 'pin' and 'thrum' floral types in Primula and Fagopyrum, but classic examples are also found in insect mimicry and snail morphology. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that generate these co-adapted gene sets, as well as the mode of limiting the production of unfit recombinant forms, remains a substantial challenge. Here we show that individual wing-pattern morphs in the polymorphic mimetic butterfly Heliconius numata are associated with different genomic rearrangements at the supergene locus P. These rearrangements tighten the genetic linkage between at least two colour-pattern loci that are known to recombine in closely related species, with complete suppression of recombination being observed in experimental crosses across a 400-kilobase interval containing at least 18 genes. In natural populations, notable patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) are observed across the entire P region. The resulting divergent haplotype clades and inversion breakpoints are found in complete association with wing-pattern morphs. Our results indicate that allelic combinations at known wing-patterning loci have become locked together in a polymorphic rearrangement at the P locus, forming a supergene that acts as a simple switch between complex adaptive phenotypes found in sympatry. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can have a central role in the coexistence of adaptive phenotypes involving several genes acting in concert, by locally limiting recombination and gene flow.
The mouse syndactylism (sm) mutation impairs some of the earliest aspects of limb development and leads to subsequent abnormalities in digit formation. In sm homozygotes, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) is hyperplastic by embryonic day 10.5, leading to abnormal dorsoventral thickening of the limb bud, subsequent merging of the skeletal condensations that give rise to cartilage and bone in the digits, and eventual fusion of digits. The AER hyperplasia and its effect on early digital patterning distinguish sm from many other syndactylies that result from later failure of cell death in the interdigital areas. Here we use positional cloning to show that the gene mutated in sm mice encodes the putative Notch ligand Serrate. The results provide direct evidence that a Notch signalling pathway is involved in the earliest stages of limb-bud patterning and support the idea that an ancient genetic mechanism underlies both AER formation in vertebrates and wing-margin formation in flies. In addition to cloning the sm gene, we have mapped three modifiers of sm, for which we suggest possible candidate genes.
In the past 50 years, biologists have learned a tremendous amount about human brain function and its genetic basis. At the same time, political scientists have been intensively studying the effect of the social and institutional environment on mass political attitudes and behaviors. However, these separate fields of inquiry are subject to inherent limitations that may only be resolved through collaboration across disciplines. We describe recent advances and argue that biologists and political scientists must work together to advance a new science of human nature.
In studies of the genetics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the product of the nef gene, formerly known as F, 3'-orf, or B-ORF, was a negative regulator of HIV-1 replication. Proviruses with mutations in the nef gene replicated better than their standard counterparts during transient expression, and the mutant virus maintained its enhanced replication even after serial passages in T lymphocytes. The nef protein trans-suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, the replication of wild-type and nef mutant proviruses and the expression of reporter genes linked to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). The repression induced by the nef protein was mediated by inhibition of transcription from the HIV-1 LTR, which contains a far upstream cis element (previously recognized to be a negative regulatory element) between 340 and 156 nucleotides upstream of the RNA initiation site.
The DNA sequence of human chromosome 21 (HSA21) has opened the route for a systematic molecular characterization of all of its genes. Trisomy 21 is associated with Down's syndrome, the most common genetic cause of mental retardation in humans. The phenotype includes various organ dysmorphies, stereotypic craniofacial anomalies and brain malformations. Molecular analysis of congenital aneuploidies poses a particular challenge because the aneuploid region contains many protein-coding genes whose function is unknown. One essential step towards understanding their function is to analyse mRNA expression patterns at key stages of organism development. Seminal works in flies, frogs and mice showed that genes whose expression is restricted spatially and/or temporally are often linked with specific ontogenic processes. Here we describe expression profiles of mouse orthologues to HSA21 genes by a combination of large-scale mRNA in situ hybridization at critical stages of embryonic and brain development and in silico (computed) mining of expressed sequence tags. This chromosome-scale expression annotation associates many of the genes tested with a potential biological role and suggests candidates for the pathogenesis of Down's syndrome.
The recA protein mediates both genetic recombination and several cellular responses to DNA damage, including the induction of temperate bacteriophage. Indication of phage lambda results from proteolytic cleavage of lambda repressor directed by recA protein. We show here that this cleavage reaction requires both polynucleotide and ATP. We suggest that a stoichiometric complex of recA protein and DNA is active both to destroy repressors by proteolytic cleavage and to initiate pairing of this DNA to its homologous sequence in a DNA duplex ('strand invasion').
